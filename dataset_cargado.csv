July 10, 2015  
  
Thank you, President Mester , and thank you to the City Club for inviting me to 
speak today.  I am aware of the c lub’s history  and its tradition of promoting  the free 
exchange of ideas, and I will do m y best to allow plenty of time for your questions, which 
I understand are an important part of that tradition.   
Communicating  with the public is  an important part of my job.  A  few weeks ago,  
I held  a news conference after the latest meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee  
(FOMC) .  Next week I  will deliver the Fed eral Reserve’s semiannual r eport on monetary 
policy  and answer  questions from members of Congress  at public hearings of the House 
and the Senate. 
   On those occasions and in appearances such as this one today, the  aim is to 
account for the FOMC’s policy actions and explain how they are intended to achieve the specific goals that the Congress has assigned us .  We do so because it is important that 
the Federal Reserve remain s accountable within th e framework of our democracy .  We 
also do so because we can more effectively achiev e our mandated goals --maximum 
employment and price s tability --as well as  help maintain stability in the financial system 
if people understand what we are  doing and why.  Finally, it’s important for us to hear 
perspectives and experiences from a wide range of participants in the economy.  Th is 
club stands for free and open communication, and so does the Federal Reserve. 
The Recovery from the Great Recessi on  
This month marks six years since the  end of the Great Recession --our nation’s 
most severe economic downturn since the 1930s .  U.S. e conomic output --as measured by 
inflation -adjusted gross domestic product , or real GDP --fell more than 4  percent  from the  
end of 2007 to the middle of 2009.  O ne of the hardest -hit industries  was manufacturing,  - 2 - 
which , as you well know,  is important to  Ohio.  The unemployment rate peaked at 10  
percent  nationally, and it reached 11  percent here in Ohio.  U.S. nonfarm payroll s shrank 
by 8- 1/2 million  jobs  during  2008 and 2009, or about 6 percent of the national workforce.  
Over that same period, Ohio lost more than  400,000 jobs, or 7- 1/2 percent of the state’s 
employment. 
In resp onse to the  financial crisis , the severe recession , and the risk that inflation 
would fall persistently far below levels consistent with price stability , we at the Federal 
Reserve took forceful  actions .  The FOMC  aggressively cut our short -term interest rate 
target , the federal funds rate, from above 5 percent to near zero  by the end of 2008 to 
lower borrowing costs and help spur household spending and business investment .  With 
short -term interest rates  near zero , the FOMC provided further support to the economy 
through our large -scale asset purchases --buying large amounts  of Treasury and mortgage -
related secu rities  in the open market .  These purchases pushed down longer -term 
borrowing rates  for millions of American families and businesses .  During the economic 
recovery, we put additional downward pressure on longer -term borrowing  rates by 
explaining publicly that we intended to keep short -term interest rates low for a long time .  
Longer -term borrowing rates, such as those for mortgages and automobile loans, are 
lower if people expect short -term rates in the future to remain low or to rise only very 
gradually.  
Although evidence suggests that our policy actions  were effective, the pace of the 
economic recovery  has been slow.1  Growth in real GDP has averaged only about 
                                                 
1 A number of studies have found that the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases put downward pressure on 
long-term interest rates.  These include Joseph Gagnon, Matthew Raskin, Julie Remache, and Brian Sack 
(2011), “The Financial Market Effects of the Federal Reserve’s Large -Scale Asset Purchases,” 
International Journal of Central Banking, vol. 7 (March), pp. 3 -43; and Stefania D’Amico, William  - 3 - 
2-1/4 percent per year since 2009, about 1 percentage point less than the ave rage rate 
seen over the 25 years  preceding the Great Recession .  In Ohio, economic output has 
increased  at about the same pace as in the nation as a whole in recent years .  In the labor 
market , the U.S.  unemployment  rate st ood at 5.3 percent  in June , around half as high as 
its peak after the recession and close to many  economists’  assessment of its longer -run 
natural rate--the level that can be sustained without risking excessive inflation .  The U.S. 
economy has created 12 million jobs  since the labor market’s low point , and total 
nonfarm payroll s are now 3- 1/2 million  greater than just prior to the recession.  Ohio ’s 
unemployment rate has declined  even  more during the recovery  than the nation as a 
whole , and  at 5.2 percent in May , it was somewhat below the U.S. average  in that month .  
Nevertheless , although nonfarm payroll s in Ohio have  increased by around 400,000 jobs 
since the low point  for the state’s employment, payrolls have yet to surpass  their leve l 
just prior to the recession . 
Manufacturing is important to  Ohio, and  people here are keenly aware of the  
challenges that American manufacturing  has faced  for many years .  U.S. manufacturing 
output --as measured in  the Federal Reserve’s in dex of industrial  production --plunged 
about 20 percent during the recession.  That’s  substantially  more than the  overall 
percentage decline  in economic output .  Partly as a result, U.S. m anufacturing 
employment fell  2-1/4 million  during 2008 and 2009, a significantly large r percentage 
decline than occurred in overall employment.  And while manufacturing employment 
                                                 
English, David López -Salido, and Edward Nelson (2012), “The Federal Reserve’s Large -Scale Asset 
Purchase Programs:  Rati onale and Effects,” Economic Journal, vol. 122 (November), pp. F415- 46.  
Moreover, the Federal Reserve’s forward guidance and asset purchase policies have been estimated to have 
helped lower unemployment and boost inflatio n; see Eric M. Engen, Thomas Lauba ch, and David 
Reifschneider (2015), “The Macroeconomic Effects of the Federal Reserve’s Unconventional Monetary 
Policies,” Finance and Economics  Discussion Series 2015- 005 (Washington:  Board of Governors of the 
Federal Reserve System, January), http://dx.doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2015.005.   - 4 - 
nationwide has increased about 850,000 since the end of 2009 as production has 
recovered , there are still a lmost 1 -1/2 million fewer manufacturing jobs than just before 
the recession.   
Unfortunately, t he number of U.S. m anufacturing jobs ha s been  generally  
decreasing since its  peak in the late 1970s .  A similar trend has also been seen in Ohio, 
where manufacturing jobs have shrunk from about 25 percent of  the state’s private -sector 
employment in 1990 to  about 15 percent  now .  So, some of the decline  in manufacturing 
jobs since the recession reflects the longer -term structural downtrend of employment in 
this sector.  But labeling a part of the  losses in man ufacturing  jobs  as structural , rather 
than related to  the recession,  in no way diminishes how wrenching those losses have 
been.  T his painful  trend  reflect s a number of long- term challenges  faced by domestic 
manufacturers , including the relative  costs of  labor and investment in  producing 
domestically versus abroad .  However, U.S. factory workers, on average, are more 
productive than their counterparts abroad, and domestic manufacturers report that they are looking for more workers with these greater skills as they increase their use of automation and redesign their production processes.   
Current Conditions in t he Labor Market  
As I noted, the  national  unemployment rate has declined  markedly  during the 
economic recovery.  B ut it is my judgment that the  lower level of the  unemployment rate 
today probably does not fully capture the  extent of slack  remaining  in the labor market --
in other words, how far away we are from a full -employment economy .  In assessing  
labor market slack , we try to  distinguish between the effects of c yclical  fluctuations in the 
economy  and the influences of longer -term structural changes , such as  the aging of the  - 5 - 
workforc e and other demographic trends .  Cyclical and structural factors both have 
affected a number of measures of labor market outcomes  that bear on our assessment  of 
slack , including labor force participation (that is, how many people are working or are 
actively looking for work) , the number of people work ing part  time who would rather 
work full  time, the pace of hiring, and the rate at which people are  quitting jobs.    
Let’s first c onsider the labor force participation rate .  It continued to decline 
substantially after  the recession  ended , with the pace of those declines slowing only over 
the past year  or so  even as the unemployment rate  has continued to fall.  M any working-
age people who are not in the labor force have chosen that status voluntarily ; examples 
would include retirees, teenagers  and young adults in school, and people staying home to 
care f or children and other dependent fam ily members.   Even in a stronger job market , it 
is likely that many of these individuals would prefer not to work.  A nd, indeed, a 
noticeabl e portion of the  decline in labor force participation seen over the past decade or 
so clearly relates to the aging of baby  boom ers and their  ongoing  retirement s.2  However,  
the pace of decline in the participation rate  accelerated during the recession , as some 
individuals who lost their jobs became discouraged and stopped looking for work.  It 
appears  that, despite a d rop in the participat ion rate reported in June, the pace of this 
decline has slowed  since early last year .  Nevertheless  I think a significant number of 
individuals still are not seeking work because they perceive a lack of good  job 
opportunities , and that  a stronger economy would draw  some of them back into the labor 
force .

William Wascher (2014), “Labor Force Participation:  Recent Developmen ts and Future Prospects,”

www.brookings.edu/~/media/Projects/BPEA/Fall -2014/Fall2014BPEA_Aaronson_et_al.pdf .  - 6 - 
Another  factor we consider when assessing  labor market slack is the elevated 
number of workers who are employed in  part-time jobs but would prefer to have  full-time 
work --in other words, those classified as “part time for economic reasons .”  At around 
4-1/2 percent of e mployment, the share of such workers is notably larger  than has been 
historically typical  in a growing econom y.  Some portion of the greater share of  work ers 
who are part time for economic reasons  may reflect structural rather than cyclical 
factors.3  For example, the ongoing shift in employment away from manufacturing  and 
toward services, a sector which historically relied more heavily on part -time workers, 
may be boosting the share of part -time jobs.  Despite these structural trends, which make 
it difficult to know  where the share of those employed pa rt time for economic reasons 
may settle in the long er run, I continue to think that it probably remains higher  than it 
would be in a full -employment economy .   
Other indicators also generally corroborate the view that while the labor market 
has improved, it still has not fully recovered.  For example, the  rate at which employees  
quit their jobs for other opportuni ties has tended to go up in a strong economy, sin ce 
more workers voluntarily leave  their jobs when they have greater confiden ce about their 
ability to find new ones and when firms are competing more actively for new hires.  
Indeed, the quits rate has picke d up as the labor market  has improved over the  past few 
years, but it still is not as high as it was through much of the early 2000s .  Another 
important indicator is the number of available positions, or job openings, that employers currently have posted.  J ob openings have increased significantly over the past year  and a 
                                                 
3 See Tomaz Cajner, Dennis Mawhirter, Christopher Nekarda, and David Ratner (2014), “Why Is 
Involuntary Part -Time Work Elevated?” FEDS Notes (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System, April 14), www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/notes/feds -notes/2014/why -is-
involuntary- part-time-work -elevated -20140414.html .  - 7 - 
half, and, in another encouraging sign, the pace of hiring has also stepp ed up in the past 
year or s o, though it too continues to run somewhat below the levels that prevailed 
through the m iddle part of the last decade .   
Finally, the pace of wage increases also  may help  shed some  light on the degree 
of labor market sl ack, since wage movements historically have tended to re spond to the 
degree of tightness in the labor market.  H ere too, however, the  signal is not entirely 
clear, as other factors such as longer -run trends in productivity growth also generally 
influence the growth of compensation.  K ey measures of hourly labor compensation rose 
at an annual  rate of only around 2 percent thr ough mos t of the recovery.  More recently, 
however, some tentative hints  of a pickup in the pace of wage gains  may  indicate that the 
objective of full employment is coming closer into view .   
Recent Inflation  Developments  
While the labor market has moved c loser to the FOMC’s mandated goal of 
maximum employment, less  progress  has been made in moving inflation close to the 
FOMC’s longer -run objective of 2 percent , which the Committee  consider s to be 
consistent with our mandated goal of price stability.  Overall consumer price i nflation has 
been close to zero  over the past year, in large part because the big drop in crude  oil prices 
since last summer has pushed  down prices for gasoline  and other  consumer energy 
products.  Price inflation excluding  the volatile categories of energy  and food prices , or 
so-called core inflation , is often a better indicator of future o verall inflation .  But it too is 
running below our  2 percent objective and has been over most of the recovery.  The 
recent  low level of core inf lation --1.2 percent  over the past 12 months --partly reflects the 
appreciation of the foreign exchange value of the U.S. dollar during the second half of  - 8 - 
last year, as global financial markets seemed to judge that our economy was relatively 
stronger than those of many of our trading partners.  The stronger dollar has pushed down the prices of imported goods, and that, in turn, has put downward pressure on core inflation.  In addition, the plunge in oil prices may have had some indirect effects in holding dow n the prices of non- energy items in core inflation, as producers passed on to 
their customers some of the cost savings from lower energy prices.  In all, however, these downward pressures seem to be abating, and the effects of these transitory factors are expected to fall out of measures  of inflation by early next year.   
Very low inflation may not sound like a real problem to many people.  However, 
persistently  low price inflation, which can tend to slow the pace of wage  increases over 
time, can weaken  the economy  by, for example, making it more difficult for households 
and firms to pay off their debts.  A persistent, very  low inflation environment also tends 
to result in chronically low short -term interest rates.   This type of situation would leave 
less scope for  the FOMC  to respond with its conventional monetary policy tool --namely , 
a cut in the federal funds  rate--to counteract a weakening in the economy.   
The Outlook for the Economy  
Let me turn now to where I think the economy is headed  over the nex t several 
years.  T he latest estimate s show that  both real  GDP and industrial production actually  
edged down in the first quarter  of this year .  Some of this  weakness  appears to be the 
result of fact ors that I expect will be only transitory, such as the  unusually  harsh winter 
weather in some regions of the country and the West Coast  port labor dispute  that briefly 
restrained  international  trade and caused di sruptions in manufacturing supply chains .  
Also, statistical noise or measurement issues may have played some role.  T his is not the  - 9 - 
first time in recent years that real GDP  has been reported to  decline, or grow unusually 
slowly,  in the first quarter of the year .  There is a healthy debate among economis ts--
many within the Federal Reserve S ystem --about  some of the technical factors that may 
lie behind this pattern.4  Nevertheless, at least a couple of other more  persistent factors 
also likely  weighed on economic output  and industrial production in the first quarter .  In 
particular, t he higher foreign exchange value of the dollar  that I mentioned , as well as 
weak growth in some foreign economies , has restrained the demand for U.S. exports .  
Moreover , lower crude oil prices have significantly depressed business investment in the 
domestic energy sector .  Indeed, industrial production continued to decline  somewhat  in 
April and May .  We expect t he drag on domestic e conomic activity from these factors to 
ease over the course of this year,  as the value of the dollar and crude oil prices  stabilize , 
and I antici pate moderate economic growth , on balance, for this year as a whole.  As 
always, however, the economic outlook is uncertain.  Notably, although the economic 
recovery in the euro area appears to have gained a firmer footing, the situation in Greece remains unresolved.  
Looking  further  ahead, I think that many of the fundamental  factors underlying 
U.S. economic activity are solid and should lead to some pickup in the pace of economic

Seasonality in GDP,” FEDS Notes (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,

growth in the coming years.  In particular, I anticipate that employment will continue to 
expand and the unemployment rate will decline  further .   
An improving job market should, in turn, help support a faster pa ce of household 
spending growth.  Additional jobs and potentially faster wage gro wth bolster household 
incomes,  and lower  energy prices  mean consumers have more money to spend on other 
goods and services .  In addition, growing employment and wages should make 
consumers more comfortable in spending a greater portion of their incomes  than they 
have been in the aftermath of the  Great Recession .  Moreover, increases in house values 
and stock market  prices, along with reductions in debt in recent years , have pushed up 
households’ net worth, which also should support more spending.  Finally, interest  rates 
faced by borrowers  remain  low, reflecting the FOMC’s highly accommodative monetary 
policies.   Indeed, recent encouraging data about  retail sales and light motor vehicle 
purchases in the  beginning of the  second quarter could be an indication that the pace of 
consumer  spending is pi cking up.  
Another positive factor for the outlook is that  the drag on economic growth in 
recent years from changes in federal fiscal policies  appears to have waned .  Temporary  
fiscal stimulus  measures  supported economic output  during the recession and earl y in the 
recovery , but those  stimulus  measures  have since expired , and  additional policy actions  
were taken to reduce the  federal budget deficit .  By 2011, these changes in  fiscal polic ies 
were holding back economic  growth .  Howeve r, the effects of those fiscal policy actions  
now seem to be mostly behind us.5  
                                                 
5 The C ongressional Budget Office estimates that current federal fiscal policies will have little effect on 
economic growth this year, but that earlier fiscal policy actions reduced the rate of real GDP growth 
roughly 1 -1/2 percentage points in 2013 and about 1/4 percentage point in 2014 relative to what it would  - 11 - 
There are a couple of  factors , however, that I e xpect could restrain economic 
growth .  First , business owners and managers remain  cautious  and have not substantially 
increased their capital expenditu res despite the  solid fundamental s and  brighter prospects 
for consumer spending .  Businesses are holding large amounts of cash on their balance 
sheets , which may suggest that greater  risk aversion is playing a role.  Indeed, s ome 
economic analysi s sugge sts that uncertainty about the strength of the recovery and about  
government economic policies  could be contributing to the restraint in business 
investment .6 
A second  factor that could restrain economic growth regards housing.  W hile 
national home prices  have been rising for a few years  and home sales  have improved 
recently , residential construction has remain ed quite soft.  Many households still find it 
difficult to obtain mortgage credit, but , more generally, the weak job market and slow 
wage gains in recen t years appear to have induced people to double -up on housing .  For 
example, many young adults  continue to liv e with their parents.  Population growth is 
creating a need for more housing, whether to rent or to own, and I do expect that 
continuing job and w age gains will encourage  more people to form new  households .  
Nevertheless, activity in the housing sector seems  likely to improve only gradually.   
Regarding inflation, as  I mentioned earlier,  the recent  effects of lower prices for 
crude  oil a nd for imports  on overall inflation are expected to wane during this year .  
Combined with further tightening in labor  and product  market s, I expect inflation will 
move toward  the FOMC’s  2 percent  objective  over  the next few years.  Importantly, a 
                                                 
have been otherwise.  See Congressional Budget Office, The Budget and Economic Outlook:  2015 to 2025 
(Washington:  CBO, January), p. 32, https://www.cbo.gov/publication/49 892. 
6 A recent survey of this research is presented by Nicholas Bloom (2014), “Fluctuations in Uncertainty,” 
Journal of Economic Perspectives,  vol. 28 (Spring), pp. 153- 76.  - 12 - 
number of differ ent surveys  indicate  that longer -term inflation expectations  have 
remained stable even as recent  reading s on inflation have fallen.   If inflation expectations 
had not remained stable, I would be more concerned because consumer and business 
expectations abo ut inflation can be come self -fulfilling.    
Implications for Monetary Policy  
My own outlook for the economy  and inflation is broadly consistent with the 
central tendency of the projections submitted by FOMC participants  at the time of our 
June meeting .  Based on my  outlook, I expect that it will be  appropriate at some point 
later this year to take the first step to  raise the federal funds rate and  thus  begin 
normalizing monetary policy.  But I want to emphasize  that the course of the economy  
and inflation remains  highly uncertain, and unanticipated  developments could delay or 
accelerate this  first step.  We  will be watching carefully to see if there is continued 
improvement in l abor market  conditions, and we  will need to be reasonably confident that 
inflation will move back to 2 percent in the next few years .  
Let me also stress that this initial increase in the federal funds rate, whenever it 
occurs, will by itself have only  a very small effect on the overall level of monetary 
accommodation provided by the  Federal Reserve.  Because there are some  factors, which 
I mentioned earlier, that continue to restrain the economic expansion, I currently 
anticipate that the  appropriate pace of normalization will be gradual , and  that monetary 
policy will need to be highly supportive of economic activity  for quite some time.  The 
projections of m ost of my FOMC colleagues indicate that they have similar  expectation s 
for the likely path of the federal funds rate.  But , again , both the course of the economy 
and inflation are uncertain.  If progress toward our employment and inflation goals is  - 13 - 
more rapid than expected, it may be appropriate to remove  monetary policy  
accommodation  more quickly.  However, if  progress  toward our goals  is slower  than 
anticipated , then the Commi ttee may  move more slowly  in normalizing policy .   
Long- Run Economic Growth   
Before I conclude, let me very briefly place my discussion of the economic 
outlook into a longer -term context.  The Federal Reserve contributes to the nation’s 
econom ic performance  in part by using monetary policy to help achieve our mandated 
goals of maximum employment and price stability.  But success in promoting these 
objectives  does  not, by itself , ensure a strong pace of long -run economic growth or 
substantial  improvement s in future  living standards.  The most important factor 
determining  continued advances  in living standards is productivity growth, defined as the 
rate of increase in how much a worker  can produce in an hour of work.  Over time, 
sustained increases in producti vity are necessary to support rising household incomes.  
Here the recent data have been disappointing.  The growth rate of output per hour 
worked in the business sector has averaged about 1 -1/4 percent per year since the 
recession began in late 2007 and has  been essentially flat over the past year .  In contrast, 
annual productivity gains averag ed 2- 3/4 percent over the decade  preceding the Great 
Recession .  I mentioned earlier the sluggish pace of wage gains in recent years, and while 
I do t hink that this i s evidence of some persisting labor market  slack , it also may reflect, 
at least in part, fair ly weak productivity growth.  
There are many unanswered questions about what has slowed productivity growth 
in recent years and about the prospects for productivity  growth in the longer run.  But we 
do know that productivity ultimately depends on many factors, including our workforce’s  - 14 - 
knowledge and skills a long with the quantity and quality of the capital  equipment , 
technology, and infrastructure that they have to w ork with.  A s a general principle , the 
American people would be well served by  the active  pursui t of effective policies to 
support longer -run growth in productivity.  Policies to strengthen education and training , 
to encourage entrepreneurship and innovati on, and to promote capital investme nt, both 
public and private, could all potentially be of great benefit  in improving  future living 
standards in our nation.

Reflections on Monetary Policy in 2021

“How Monetary Policy Got Behind the Curve and How to Get Back:    
A Policy Conference ” 
Hoover Institution  
 
Stanford, California  
          
May 6, 2022 
  
I want to thank the organizers for inviting me to speak here today.  The  discussion 
has focused on the following question: “How did the Fed get so far behind the curve?” 
My response is to relate how my view of the economy changed over the course of 2021 and how that evolving view shaped my policy position.  When thinking about  this 
question, there are three points that need to be considered.  First, the Fed was not alone in underestimating the strength of inflation that revealed itself in late 2021.  Second, to determine whether the Fed was behind the curve, one must take a pos ition on the 
evolving health of the labor market during 2021.  Finally, setting policy in real time can create what appear to be policy errors after the fact due to data revisions.  
Let me start by remind ing everyone of two immutable facts about setting 
monetary policy in the United States.  First, we have a dual mandate from the Congress: 
maximum employment and price stability.  Whether you believe this is the appropriate 
mandate or not, it is the law of the land , and it is our job to pursue both objectives .  
Second, policy is set by a large committee of up to 12 voting members and a total of 19 participa nts in our discussions.  This structure brings a wide range of views to the 
table and a diverse set of opinions on how to interpret incoming economic data a nd how 
best to respond.  We need to reconcile those views and reach a consensus that we believe will move the economy toward our mandate.  This process may lead to more gradual 
changes in policy as members have to compromise in order to reach a consensus.  
Back in September and December 2020, respectively,  the Federal Open Market 
Committee ( FOMC)  laid out guidance for raising the federal funds rate off the zero lower 
bound and for tapering asset purchases.  We said that we would “aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time” to ensure that it averages 2 percent over time   - 2 - 
and that inflation expectations stay anchored.  We also said that the Fed would keep 
buying $120 billion per  month in securities until “substantial further progress” was made 
toward our dual -mandate objectives.  It is important to stress that views varied among 
FOMC participants on what was “som e time” and “substantial further progress.”  The 
metrics for achieving these outcomes also varied across participants.  
A few months later, in March 2021, I made my first submission for the Summary 
of Economic Projections as an FOMC member.  My projection had inflation above 2 percent for 2021 and 2022, with unemployment close to my long- run estimate by the 
second half of 2022.  Given this projection, which I believed was consistent with the guidance from December, I penciled in lifting off the zero lower bound in 2022, with the second half of the ye ar in mind.  To lift  off from the ZLB in the second half of 2022, I 
believed tapering of asset purchases would have to start in the second half of 2021 and conclude by the third quarter of 2022.  
This projection was based on my judgment that the economy would heal much 
faster than many expected.  This was not 2009, and expectations of a slow, grinding recovery were inaccurate, in my view.  In April 2021, I said the economy was “ready to rip,” and it did.
1  I chose to look at the unemployment rate and job cr eation  as the labor 
market indicators I would use to assess whether we had made “substantial further progress.”  My projection was also based on the belief that the jump in inflation that occurred in March 2021 would be more persistent than many expected.

There was a range of views on the C ommittee.  Eleven of my colleagues did not 
have a rate hike penciled in until after 2023.  With regard to future inflation, 
13 participants projected inflation in 2022 would be at or below our 2 percent target.  In 
the M arch 2021 SEP, no C ommittee member expected inflation to be over 3  percent for 
2021.  As I argued in a speech last December, this view was consistent with private -
sector economic forecasts.2   
When inflation broke loose in March 2021, even though I had expected it to run 
above 2 percent in 2021 and 2022, I never thought it would reach the very high levels we 
have seen in recent months.  Indeed, I  expected it would eventually fade, due to the 
nature of these shocks .  All the suspected drivers of this surge in inflation appeared to be 
temporary : the one -time stimulus from fiscal policy, supply chain shocks that previous 
experience indicated would ease soon, and a surge in demand  for goods .  In addition, we 
had very accommodative monetary policy that I believe d would end in 2022.  The issue 
in my mind was whether these factors would start fading away later in 2021 or in 2022.  
Over the summer of 2021, the labor market and other data related to economic 
activity came in as I expected, and so I argued publicly that we were rapidly approaching “substantial further progress” on the employment leg of our mandate.  In the June 
Summary of Economic Projections , seven participants had liftoff in 2022 and only five  
participants projected liftoff after 2023.  Also, unlike the March SEP, every C ommittee 
participant now expected inflation to be over 3 percent in 2021 and just five believed 
inflation would be at 2 percent or below in 2022.  In addition, the vast majority  of

Economic Forecasters ,” speech delivered at the Forecasters Club of New York, New York , December 17,

participants  now saw risk s associated with inflation weighted to the upside .  The June 
2021 m inutes also describe the vigorous discussion about tapering asset purchases.  
Numerous participants said that new data indicated that tapering should begin sooner than 
anticipated.3  Thus, in June,  after observing high inflation for only three months, the 
Committee was moving in a hawkish direction and was considering tapering sooner and 
pulling liftoff forward.  
At the July FOMC meeting, the minutes show that most participants believed that 
“substantial further progress” had been made on inflation but not employment.4  Tapering 
was not viewed as imminent by most participants.  Again, individual participants had different metrics for evaluating the health of the labor market, and this approach 
influenced how each thought about policy.  So, in my view, one cannot address the question of “ how did the Fed get so far behind the curve?” without taking a stand on the 
health of the labor market as we moved through 2021. 
Based on the incoming data over the summer, my position was that we would 
soon achieve the substantial further  progress needed to start tapering of asset purchases—
in particular,  our purchases of agency mortgage -backed securities— and that we needed to 
“go early and go fast” on tapering our asset purchases to position ourselves for rate hikes in 2022 should we need to tighten policy .
5  I also argued that , if the July and August job 
reports came in around the forecast values of 800,000 to 1 million job gains per month, 
we should commence tapering our asset purchases at the September 2021 FOMC

meeting.  The July repo rt was indeed over 1 million new jobs , but then the August report 
shocked us by reporting only 235,000 new jobs when the consensus forecast was for 
750,000.  I considered this a punch in the gut and relevant to a decision on when to start tapering.
6  Neve rtheless, the September FOMC statement noted that the economy had 
made progress toward the C ommittee’s goals and that , if progress continued , it would 
soon be time to taper.7 
Up until October, monthly core personal c onsumption e xpenditure s (PCE)  
inflation was actually slowing.  As shown in Figure 1, i t went from 0.62  percent  in April 
to 0.24 percent  for the month of September.  The September jobs report was another 
shock, with only 194,000 jobs created.  So, up until the first week of October 2021, the story  of high inflation being temporary was holding up, and the labor market 
improvements had slowed but were continuing.  Based on the incoming data, the FOMC announced the start of tapering at its early November meeting.
8 
It was the October and N ovember consumer price index ( CPI) reports that showed 
that the deceleration of inflation from April to September was short lived and year -over-
year inflation had topped 6 percent.  It became clear that the high inflation  realizations 
were not as temporary  as originally thought .  And the October jobs report showed a 
significant rebound with 531,000 jobs created and  big upward revisions to the previous 
two months.  
 
6 Of course, as we all know, th ese employment data would be revised upward substantially, but that was not 
known to policymakers at the time , and it’s important to explicitly make that point now —the data were 
choppy and did not lend themselves to a clear picture of the outlook.  
7 See Board  of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2021), “ FOMC Statement ,” press release, 
September 22, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetar y20210922a.htm .

November 3, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newseve nts/pressreleases/monetary20211103a.htm .  - 6 - 
It was at this point—with a clearer picture of inflation and revised  labor market 
data in hand —that the FOMC  pivoted.  In its December meeting, the Committee 
accelerated tapering , and the SEP showed that each individual participant projected an 
earlier liftoff in 2022 with a median projection of three rate hikes in 2022 .  These 
forecasts and forwar d guidance had a significant effect  on raising market interest rates , 
even though we did nothing with our primary policy tool, the federal funds rate, in 
December 2021.  It is worth noting that markets had the same view of likely policy—federal funds rate futures in November and December called for three hikes in 2022, 
indicating an economic outlook that was similar to the Committee’s.  
Given this description of how policy evolved over 2021, did the Fed fall far 
behind the curve?  
First, I want to emphasize that forecasting is hard for everyone, especially in a 
pandemic.  In terms of missing on inflation, policymakers’ projections looked very much 
like most of the public ’s.  For example, as shown in table 1, the median SEP forecast for 
2021 Q4/Q4 PCE inflation was very similar to the consensus from the Blue Chip , which 
is a compilation of private sector forecasts.  In short, nearly everyone was behind the curve when it came to forecasting the magnitude and persistence of inflation.   
Second, as I menti oned, you cannot answer this question without taking a stand 
on the employment leg of our mandate.  There was a clear difference in views on this and on what indicators should be looked at to determine whether we had met the ‘substantial further progress” criteria we laid out in our December 2020 guidance. Some of us concluded the labor market was healing fast and we pushed for earlier and faster withdrawal of accommodation.  For others, data suggested the labor market was not  - 7 - 
healing that fast and it was n ot optimal to withdraw policy accommodation soon.  Many 
of our critics tend to focus only on the inflation aspect of our mandate and ignore the 
employment leg of our mandate.  B ut we cannot .  So, what may appear as a policy error 
to some was  viewed as appr opriate  policy by others based on their views regarding the 
health of the labor market.  
Third, one must account for setting policy in real time.   The Committee was 
getting mixed signals from the labor market data in August and September.  Two 
consecutive w eak job reports didn’t square with a rapidly falling unemployment rate.  
Later that fall, and then with the Labor Department’s 2021 revisions, we found that payrolls were quite steady over the course of the year.  As shown in table 2, revisions to changes in payroll employment since late last summer have been quite substantial.  From the original reports to the current estimate, the change in payroll employment has been revised up nearly 1.5 million.  As the revisions came in, a consensus grew that the labo r 
market was much stronger than we originally thought.  If we knew then what we know now, I believe the Committee would have accelerated tapering and raised rates sooner.  But no one knew, and that’s the nature of making monetary policy in real time.  
Final ly, if one believes we were behind the curve in 2021, how far behind were 
we?  In a world of forward guidance, one simply cannot look at the policy rate to judge 
the stance of policy.  Even though we did not actually move the policy rate  in 2021, we 
used f orward guidance to start raising market rates starting with the September 2021 
statement , which indicated tapering was coming soon.  The 2 -year Treasury yield , which 
I view as a good market indicator of our policy stance, went from approximately 25 b asis 
points  in late September 2021 to 75 basis points by late December.  That is the  - 8 - 
equivalent, in my mind, of two 25 basis point policy rate hikes for impacting the financial 
markets.  When looked at this way, how far behind the curve could we have possibly 
been if , using  forward guidance, one views rate  hikes  effectively beginning in September 
2021?  Slides for “Reflections on

“The Future of Community Banking”  
 
A Conference Sponsored by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  
 
Arlington , Virginia  
 
 
 
February 1 6, 2012   
It is a pleasure to speak at the F ederal Deposit Insurance Corporation ’s (FDIC) 
conference  on the future of community banking .  This conference is indeed an important 
and timely  one.  Community banks make a critical contribution to the prosperity of both 
their localities and the nation as a whole , which is why we at the Federal Reserve and the 
other banking agencies  are acutely interested in their long -term strength and viability.1   
Today I w ill discuss the role community banking organizations play in supporting 
the health  of our economy , as well as some  of the challenges they face .  Because  we 
greatly value our ongoing dialogue with community banks, I will also speak  about  the 
Federal Reserve’s  efforts to improve our understanding of the pressures affecting 
community banks  and to foster constructive supe rvisory relationships .   
The Role of Community Bank s in a Challenging  Economy  
Although  community banks provide a  wide  range of services for their customers, 
their primary activit ies revolve around the traditional banking model --specifically, taking  
short -term deposits to fund  longer-term investments, such as small business , agricultural,  
or commercial real estate  loans .  Accordingly , risks at community banks tend to ar ise 
from their lending, in the form of credit risk, interest  rate risk , or concentration risk,  
rather  than from the trading, market -making, and investment banking  activities associated 
with the largest banks .  However, b y taking on and managing the risks of local lending, 
which larger banks may be  unwilling or unable to do, community  banks  help keep their 
local economies  vibrant  and growing.   Importantly,  community banks  are well position ed 
to go beyond the standardized credit models used by larger banks and consider a range of  
                                                           
1 For purposes of these remarks, the terms “community bank” and “community banking organization” will 
be used interchangeably to refer to both banks and bank holding companies with total consolidated assets 
of $10 billion or less.  - 2 - 
 
 factors when mak ing credit decisions.  In particular, t hey often respond with greater 
agility to lending requests than their national competitors because of their detailed 
knowledge of  the needs of their customers and their close ties to  the communities they 
serve .  
While community banks have certain natural advantages, they also face an array 
of challenges, stemming from both the current economy and,  to some extent, from  their 
business model.   The close ties of community banks to local economies is a source of 
strength, as I mentioned, but th ose close linkages  have drawbacks as well, most notably 
the resulting concentration of exposures to those same local economies.   Strong 
community banks take measures to counteract this risk, but it is not possible to fully 
manage it away.   Thus, the fortun es of communities and their banks tend to rise and fall 
together.  Community banks must also manage concentration risks arising from their 
specialization in certain categories of lending.  For example, larger banks have used their 
scale to gain a pricing a dvantage over community banks in volume -driven businesses 
such as consumer lending.  This  strategy , in turn, has exacerbated a long -standing trend 
toward a greater concentration of community bank lending  in certain areas  less dependent 
on volume , such as loans secured by commercial real estate .  Community banks will  need 
to continue their ongoing efforts  to prudently diversify their revenue sources.  
Like larger banks, community banks are also being affected by the state of the 
national economy .  Despite some recent signs of improvement , the recovery has been 
frustratingly slow , constraining  opportunities for profitable lending.   As I will discuss 
later, actual and prospective changes in the regulatory landscape have also raised 
concerns among community ba nkers.   These headwinds notwithstanding , measures of the - 3 - 
 
 financial condition of community banks appear to have strengthened somewhat , 
suggesting that, for the most part,  the industry is meeting its  challenges.  Profits of 
smaller banks have risen for the p ast several  quarters.  A lthough the ratios of 
nonperforming assets remain high in many cases, a sset quality appears to be  stabilizing, 
and bank provisions for loan losses are decreasing.  In addition, capital ratios are steadily 
improving at community bank s, in part due to increases in retained earnings and a greater 
ability to raise new capital . 
Let me take this opportunity to mention  one concern that is of particular relevance 
to the Federal Reserve:  A common complaint on the part of  some community banke rs is 
that very low interest rates hurt their profitability by squeezing net interest margins.  
Since the onset of the financial crisis, t he Federal Reserve ’s monetary policy has been 
accommodative , as you know .  In particular, the federal funds target rate, which stood at 
5-1/4 percent in mid -2007, was lowered  to a range of 0 to 1/4 percent by the end of 2008 
and has since remained at that level .  Although these policies do not seem to have led  to 
much change in aggregate measures of net interest margin s, at least thus far, we continue 
to hear that many  banks are feeling pressures from this source.   
The effects  of the configuration of interest rates on  banks and other financial 
institutions are certainly  part of the discussion when we strive to determine  the 
appropriate  monetary policy .  Several points should be made , though .  First, it is true that 
the difference between the yield on safe assets such as Treasury securities  and the rate 
paid on deposits is currently relatively low.  However, banks’ net in terest margin s also 
depend importantly on the difference between the return on the loans the banks  make  and 
the return on  their alternative investments in  safe assets.  When loan demand is weak, - 4 - 
 
 forcing banks to hold low -return safe assets  instead  of lending , net interest margin s 
suffer .  The purpose of the Federal Reserve’s policy of low interest rates is t o speed the 
economic recovery , which  will increase loan demand and opportunities for profitable 
lending , among many other benefits,  and thus, ultimately , lead to higher net interest 
margins .  In short, it is necessary to set the negative effects on net interest margins 
against the positive effects of a strengthening economic and lending environment .  
Moreover, the benefits of a stronger economy for the performance of existing assets  
should also be taken into account ; as you know, delinquencies decline as the economy 
improves .  Putting all these considerations together , in the longer term the overall effect 
on ba nk profitability  of an appropriately accommodative monetary policy  is almost 
certainly  positive .   
Outreach and Communication  with Community Banks  
I think we would all agree that  two-way communic ation between regulators  and 
community banks is critical.  The Fed and other bank supervisors , at both the state and 
federal levels,  must clearly communicate their supervisory policies and expectations to 
banks, but they also must listen to and understand  banks’ concerns.   For th e Fed eral 
Reserve  in particular, community banks not only provide insights into the ir industry, but 
they are also an unmatched source of crucial grassroots information about developments 
in the economy as a whole, which is necessary for effective monetary policy.  
At the Federal Reserve , we pursue our dialogue with community bankers through 
many channels.  One such channel is  the recently established Community Depository - 5 - 
 
 Institutions Advisory Council (CDIAC) .2  The council’s  membership is drawn from 
smaller banks, credit unions, and savings associations .  Each  of the 12 Reserve Bank s 
around the country  has a local advisory council, and one representative from each local 
council serves on the national council that meets with the Board in Washington twice a 
year.   These meetings allow the Federal Reserve Board to  hear directly from community 
bankers about supervisory and regulatory  issues  that affect the ir institutions as well as 
about local economic trends .   
At a recent meeting, for example, one of our CDIAC members asked us to be 
clearer  about whether particular rules  and guidance apply to community banks.  Having 
heard from this banker as well as others , we are now working  to more explicitly indicate 
which ba nks will be affected when we issue new  regulatory proposal s, final rule s, or 
regulatory guidance.  As a first step in this effort, w hen issuing supervisory letters, we 
have begun to  state specifically if and how new guidance will apply to community 
banks.3  Although this change  seems  relatively simple, we hope it will help banks avoid 
allocating precious resources to poring over supervisory guidance  that do es not apply to 
them.  We also hope that it will provide greater clarification to  our examiners, who a re on 
the frontline fielding questions from bankers  and working closely with their state 
regulatory counterparts . 
In addition to the  advisory council , the Board  last year established a special 
supervision subcommittee  to more effectively address community banking issues.

 Because of their professional backgrounds  in community banking and bank supervision , I 
asked Governors Elizabeth  Duke and Sarah Bloom Raskin to serve on this subcommittee.  
Its primary  role is to impr ove our understand ing of  community and regional banking 
conditions and to review policy proposals for their potential effect on the safety and 
soundness  of, and the regulatory costs imposed  on, community and regional institutions.4  
Governors Duke and Rask in are also keenly interested in  how our policies could a ffect 
the availability of credit to sound borrowers , and their  unique experiences and 
perspectives have contributed to the Board’s understanding of the issues that community 
bankers  care most about . 
We have  other  contacts with community banks  that have proved valuable .  For 
quite a  few years, the Reserve Banks have maintained local training and outreach 
programs for banks.  More recently, several of these programs have been expanded 
nationally.  For e xample , the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis organizes national “Ask 
the Fed”  calls to provide bankers with an opportunity to hear Federal Reserve staff 
discuss recent policy initiatives and issues  that examiners are encountering  in the field .  
In addition, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco hosts consumer compliance 
webinars , and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia publishes a quarterly overview 
of consumer compliance issues that allow s Federal Reserve staff to address questions 
from banks.5  We are exploring  options for building on  these initiatives .   
                                                           
4 For the purposes of the Federal Reserve’s supervisory programs, regional banking organizations generally 
are considered to be those banks and bank holding companies (including savings and loan holding 
companies) with total consolidated assets between $10 billion and $50 billion.

 Research by  economists throughout the Federal Reserve System is another  means 
of gaining a better understanding not only about current conditions in community 
banking , but also about the more fundamental forces that drive their profitability and 
lending.  Our researchers have looked at such topics as  the use of credit scoring in small 
business lending,  the willingness and ability of community banks to lend to small 
businesses that have lost access to lending from large banks, and the determinants of 
community bank performance both before and during the recent financial crisis --and the 
extent to which these determinants were under the control of bank manage rs.6  Our hope 
is that th is focused research effort  not only will h one our understanding of the key role 
that community banks play in the U.S. economy, but also will help us  to more effectively 
supervise these banks.  With that, let me shift to some supervisory and regulatory matters 
that are on the minds of both supervisors and bankers.  
The Supervision of Community Banks  
  Unlike most other businesses, bank s are subject to rigorous examination and 
supervision  to assess  their safety and soundness , their ability to withstand risks, and their  
compliance with a variety of laws.7  At community banks, t hese examinations involve  
off-site analys es and on -site visits  by teams of examiners , exit meetings between 
                                                           
6 The use of credit scoring in small business lending  is discussed in  Allen Berger, Adrian Cowan, and Scott 
Frame (2011), “The Surprising Use of Credit Scoring in Small Business Lending by Community Banks and 
the Attend ant Effects on Credit Availability, Risk, and Profitability,” Journal of Financial Services 
Research , vol. 39 (April), pp. 1 -17; the topic of community banks that lend to small businesses  is discussed 
in Jihye Jeon,  Judit Montoriol -Garriga, Robert K. Triest, and J. Christina Wang (2010), “ Evidence of a 
Credit Crunch?  Results from the 2010 Survey of First District Community Banks,” Federal Reserve Bank 
of Boston,  Public Policy Briefs,  no. 10 -3 (September), www.bos.frb.org/economic/ppb/2010/ppb103.pdf; 
and the determinants of community bank performance  are discussed in  Dean F. Amel and Robin A. Prager 
(2010), “Performance of Community Banks in Good Times and Bad Times,” unpublished paper, Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Division of Rese arch and Statistics, May.  
7 Examinations typically occur annually but may take place more or less frequently depending on the size 
and condition of the banking organization.  The Federal Reserve maintains a full -time, on -site p resence at 
the largest bankin g organizations.  - 8 - 
 
 examiners and senior bank manage rs to discuss  examination results , and written reports 
with narratives and metrics describing the examiners’ findings .  If necessary, of course, 
examiners may require  action s by the bank to remedy specific problems.   
These examinations, in combination with work we undertake  betwee n 
examinations, are critical for promoting safety and soundness while enhancing our 
understanding of the condition of individual banks and the banking s ystem as a whole.  
We know , however, that supervis ion impose s costs on  institutions .  In particular, we 
recognize that new regulations and supervisory requirements may impose 
disproportionate costs on community banks, which  have smaller staffs and less -elaborate 
information  systems than larger banking organizations.  Thus , we take quite seriously the 
importance of evaluating the costs  and benefits  of new rules . 
As I have noted, the comparative advantage of community bankers is that  they 
know and work with their communities and customers in way s that may not be possible 
for larger, more distant institution s.  We tailor  our examination and supervision to the 
size, complexity , risk profile, and business model  of each institution .  For community 
banks  in particular , our e xaminers  are expected to  take local market conditions  into 
account when assessing a  bank ’s management and credit decisions.   The Federal 
Reserve’s decentralized structure, in which supervision is conducted through 12 regional 
Reserve Banks,  helps facilitate our understanding of local economies , as does our 
ongoing coordination with state banking regulators .  This  connection to Main Street  is 
vitally important to fulfilling both our supervisory and monetary policy responsibilities .  
Bank supervision requires a delicate balance --particularly now .  The weak 
economy, together with loose lending standards in the past, has put pressure on the entire - 9 - 
 
 banking industry, including community banks.  To protect banks from a possible race to 
the bot tom and new problems down the road, and to safeguard the Deposit Insurance 
Fund, supervisors must insist on high standards for lending , risk management , and 
governance .  At the same time, it is important for banks, for their communities, and for 
the national economy that banks lend to  creditworthy borrowers.   Lending to 
creditworthy borrowers, after all, is how banks earn profits.  Getting that balance right is 
not alwa ys easy , but it is of utmost  importance.  
 Regulatory Challenges for Community Banking  
Community bankers  tell us repeatedly that they are concerned about the changing 
regulatory environment .  They touch on a number of areas , but one particular worry is the 
implement ation of  the Dodd -Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 
(Dodd -Frank Act) . 
It is important to emphasize  that the Congress enacted the Dodd -Frank Act  largely 
in response to  the “too  big to fail” problem, and that most  of its provisions apply only , or 
principally,  to the largest , most complex, and internationally active  banks .  To mitigat e 
the threat to financial stability posed by systemically important financial firms , the act  
required the Federal Reserve to implement enhanced prudential standards to regulate 
these firms .  The Board in December requested comment on proposed rules for 
systemically important firms,  includ ing stronger capital , leverage, liquidity, and risk-
management requirement s.  Other aspects of the proposed rules are  single -counterparty 
credit limits  and requirements to periodically produce resolution plans  (known as living - 10 - 
 
 wills)  and to conduct stress tests.8  The proposed rule s, in conjunction with other 
elements of the Dodd -Frank Act,  are designed  to make these firms safer and to force 
large firms to take into account the costs that the ir potential failure could impose on the 
broader financial system.  
These new standards are not meant to apply to, and clearly would not be 
appropriate for,  community banks .  Indeed , the Dodd -Frank Act explicitly exempts 
community banks from these new enhanced standards.  Community banks express 
concern  that the more stringent requirements for larger institutions will eventually find 
their way to smaller firm s; that, how ever, is not our intent , and we will work to ensure 
that it does not happen.  An example  that predates the Dodd -Frank Act is the interagency 
guidance issued in June 2010 covering incentive compensation .9  In that guidance , we 
were careful to note simplified expectations for community banks that did not make 
extensive use of incentive compensation.  We intend to continue this practice for other 
policies and guidance and  to continue to  speak with community bankers to respond to 
their questions and concerns  and to clarify our supervisory expectations . 
Given  the ongoing  supervisory and regulatory changes, t he Board and its senior -
level staff members have made it a priority to work  with other  regulators to increase the 
coordination and consistency of regulation across a banking industry that has multiple 
regulators and charters.  We regularly consult on these matters with the Consumer 
Financial Protection Bureau , the Securities and Exchange Commission,  and other

 agencies.10  The new Financial Stability Oversight Council also provides a forum for 
agencies to discuss the coordination of policies and initiatives.   It is important that we at 
the Federal Reserve continue to work  closely  with other agencies on supervisory matters , 
particularly in cases in which a common regulatory approach across agencies and across 
banking organizations with different charters has the potential  to reduce compliance costs 
and risks.   
One of the areas where communication between banks and examiners is 
especially important is in the ongoing supervisory process.   We conduct extensive 
training for our examiners, perform internal reviews  and studies to ensure that the  
examiners  are properly interpreting supervisory guidance, and stress  that a main goal o f 
supervision is to help bankers sustain sound  lending and risk -management practices.  We 
emphasize that open dialogue with bank management is an essential component of 
effective supervision.  
Although  we hope that bankers are able to resolve all examination issues through 
discussion with the examiner -in-charge or Reserve Bank management , it is inevitabl e that  
examiners and bankers  will sometimes differ over  examination findings  despite our best 
efforts .  For those cases , the Federal Reserve has a  robust appeals process , as well as a n 
independent ombudsman, to provide institutions with a fair and thorough review of 
complaints.11 A banking organization ’s board or management may appeal any material

information to this panel in wr iting and may appear in person.  
If the bank’ s managers or board believe this panel ’s decision did not address their

the relevant Reserve Bank.   A third review --underta ken by the member of the Board of

increase  awareness of the ombudsman’s office and encouraging bankers to use the

ombudsman reaches out to every institution that has filed an appeal within six months 
after the appeal has been decided to ensure that no retaliation or other unjustified 
reactions have  taken place.  The ombudsman has broad authority to investigate claims of 
retaliation , and, when appropriate , will report complaints  to the Board .  The Board will 
not tolerate retal iation against banking organizations that file appeals or raise concerns

 about  supervisory practices gives us extremely valuable feedback that will help us 
improve supervision and better understand the issues that banks and examiners confront 
in the field . 
Conclusion  
To conclude, I would like to reemphasize the importance  that my colleagues on 
the Board and I place on  the Federal Reserve’s  relationship with community banks.  The 
Fed is committed to fair, consistent, and informed examinations that take into account the 
size, complexity, and individual circumstances of each bank we oversee.  We will 
continue to rely on the many channels of communication I discussed today  to impr ove 
our supervision , and we will do all we can to  eliminate  unnecessary costs.   By engaging 
in a constant dialogue with community banks  through various communication channels 
and through the examination process , the Federal Reserve is able to collect  impor tant 
inform ation about local economies  and better inform  banks about the applicability and 
expectations of  new rules and regulations  intended to help keep them safe and sound .  
Despite economic uncertainties, the condition of community banks  is improving, which is 
reassuring given their  undeniable importance to the health  of our nation’s economy .

I woul d like to thank the G roup of Thirty for inviting me to participate in their 
International Banking Seminar and also thank Luis Alberto Moreno of the I nter-
American D evelopment Bank for hosting this event.  My comments today will focus on 
U.S. economic prospects and monetary policy.   
Economic activity in the United States has been growing moderately so far this 
year, and the labor market has continued to strengthen.  The terrible hurricanes that hit 
Texas, F lorida, Puerto Rico, and our neighbors in the Caribbean caused tremendous 
damage and upended many lives, and our hearts go out to those affected.  While the 
effects of the hurricanes on the U.S. economy are quite noticeable in the short term, 
history sugge sts that the longer -term effects will be modest and that aggregate economic 
activity will recover quickly.   
Starting with the labor market, through August, payroll j ob gains averaged 
170,000 per month this year, down only a little from the average pace of  gains in 2016 
and still well above estimates of the pace necessary to absorb new entrants to the labor 
force.  In September, payrolls  were reported to have declined 33,000, but that weakness  
reflect ed the effects of Hurricane Irma, which hit Florida durin g the reference week for 
the September labor market surveys.  I would expect employment to bounce back in 
subsequent months as communities recover and people return to their jobs.   Other aspects 
of the jobs  report for September were strong.  The unemployme nt rate , which seem s not 
to have been noticeably affected by the hurricanes,  declined further to  4.2 percent , down 
about 1/ 2 percentage point from the end of 2016 and below the median of Federal Open 
Market Committee (FOMC) participants ’ estimates of its longer -run normal level.  Labor 
force participation continues to strengthen relative to a downward trend that reflects, in  - 2 - 
part, the aging of the population.  Other labor market indicators, including the rates of job 
openings and the number of people who voluntarily quit their jobs, also point to strength.   
Wage indicators have been mixed, and the most recent news, on average hourly 
earnings  through September , was encouraging.  O n balance, wage gains appear moderate, 
and the pace seems broadly consistent wi th a tightening labor market once we account for 
the disappointing productivity growth in recent years.   
I expect the labor market to strengthen further as economic growth continues.  
The hurricanes will likely result in some hit to GDP growth in the thir d quarter but a 
rebound thereafter , and smoothing through those movements, I’m expecting growth that 
continues to exceed potential in the second half of the year.  The latest projections from 
FOMC participants have a median of 2 -1/2 percent GDP growth this  year.  Growth of 
consumer spending has been supported by the ongoing job gains and relatively high 
levels of household wealth and consumer sentiment.  Business investment has 
strengthened this year following surprising weakness in 2016.  The faster gains partly 
reflect an upturn in investment in the energy sector as oil prices have firmed.   But the 
gains have been broader than that, and some measures of business sentiment remain quite 
strong.  Exports also have risen this year, as growth abroad has solidi fied and the 
exchange value of the dollar has declined somewhat.  My fellow FOMC participants and 
I perceive that risks to global growth have receded somewhat and expect growth to 
continue to improve over the near term.  
The biggest surprise in the U.S. economy this year has been  inflation.  Earlier this 
year, the 12 -month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures 
(PCE) reached 2 percent, and core PCE inflation reached 1.9 percent .  These readings  - 3 - 
seemed consistent with the view that in flation had been held down by both the sizable fall 
in oil prices and the appreciation of the dollar starting around mid- 2014, and that these 
influences have diminished significantly by this year.  Accordingly, inflation seemed well 
on its way to the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation objective on a sustainable basis.   
Inflation readings over the past several months have been surprisingly soft, 
however, and the 12- month change in core PCE prices has fallen to 1.3 percent.  The 
recent softness seems to have been exaggerated by what look like one- off reductions in 
some categories of prices, especially a large decline in quality -adjusted prices for 
wireless telephone services.  More generally, it is common to see movements in inflation 
of a few tenths  of a percentage point  that are hard to explain, and such “surprises” should 
not really be surprising.  My best guess is that these soft readings will not persist, and 
with the ongoing strengthening of labor markets, I expect inflation to move higher next 
year.  Most of my colleagues on the FOMC agree.  In the latest Summary of Economic 
Projections, my colleagues and I project inflation to move higher next year and to reach 2 
percent by 2019.   
To be sure, our understanding  of the forces that drive inflation is imperfect, and 
we recognize that this year’s low inflation could reflect something more persistent than is 
reflected in our baseline projections.  The fact that a number of other advanced 
economies are also experienci ng persistently low inflation understandably adds to the 
sense among many analysts that something more structural may be going on.  Let me 
mention a few possibilities of more fundamental influences.1   
                                                 
1 For further discussion, see Janet Yellen (2017), “Inflation, Uncertainty, and Monetary Policy,” speech 
delivered  at “Prospects for Growth:  Reassessing the Fundamentals,” the 59th annual meeting of the 
National Association for Business Economics, Cleveland, Ohio, September 26, 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20170926a.htm .  - 4 - 
First, given that estimates of the natural rate of une mployment are so uncertain, it 
is possible that there is more slack in U.S. labor markets than is commonly recognized, 
which may be true for some other advanced economies as well.  If so, some further 
tightening in the labor market might be needed to lift inflation back to 2 percent.   
Second, some measures of longer -term inflation expectations have edged lower 
over the past few years in several major economies, and it remains an open question 
whether these measures might be reflecting a true decline in exp ectations that is broad 
enough to be affecting actual inflation outcomes.   
Third, our framework for understanding inflation dynamics could be misspecified 
in some way.  For example, global developments --perhaps technological  in nature , such 
as the tremend ous growth of online shopping --could be helping to hold down inflation in 
a persistent way in many countries.  Or there could be sector -specific developments --such 
as the subdued rise in medical prices in the United States in recent years --that are not 
typically included in aggregate inflation equations but which have contributed to lower 
inflation.  Such global and sectoral developments could continue to be important 
restraining influences on inflation.  Of course, there are also risks that could unexpecte dly 
boost inflation more rapidly than expected, such as resource utilization having a stronger 
influence when the economy is running closer to full capacity.  
In this economic environment, with ongoing improvements in labor market 
conditions and softness in inflation that is expected to be temporary, the FOMC has 
continued its policy of gradual policy normalization.  A s the Committee announced after  
our September meeting, we are initiating our  balance sheet normalization program this 
month.  That  program, which was described in the June A ddendum to the  Policy  - 5 - 
Normalization Principles and Plans, will gradually scale back our reinvestments of 
proceeds from maturing Treasury securities and principal payments from agency 
securities.  As a result, our balance sheet will decline gradually and predictably.2  By 
limiting the volume of securities that private investors will have to absorb as we reduce 
our holdings, the caps should guard against outsized moves in interest rates and other 
potential market strains.  
Changi ng the target range for the federal funds rate is our primary means of 
adjusting the stance of monetary policy.  Our balance sheet is not intended to be an active 
tool for monetary policy in normal times.  We therefore do not plan on making 
adjustments to our balance sheet normalization program.  But, of course, as we stated in 
June, the Committee would be prepared to resume reinvestments if a material 
deterioration in the economic outlook were to warrant a sizable reduction in the federal 
funds rate.     
 Also at our September meeting, the Committee decided to maintain its target for 
the federal funds rate.  We continue to expect that the ongoing strength of the economy 
will warrant gradual increases in that rate to sustain a healthy labor market and stabil ize 
inflation around our 2 percent longer -run objective.  That expectation is based on our 
view that the federal funds rate remains somewhat below its neutral level --that is, the 
level that is neither expansionary nor contractionary and keeps the economy operating on 
an even keel.  The neutral rate currently appears to be quite low by historical standards, 
                                                 
2 For October through December o f this year, the decline in the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings will 
be capped at $6 billion per month for Treasur y securit ies and $4 billion per month for agenc y securit ies.  
These caps will gradually rise over the course of the following year to maximums of $30 billion per month 
for Treasur y securit ies and $20 billion per month for agency securities and will remain in place through the 
process of normalizing the size of our balance sheet.   - 6 - 
implying that the federal funds rate would not have to rise much further to get to a neutral 
policy stance.  But we expect the neutral level of the feder al funds rate to rise somewhat 
over time , and, as a result, additional gradual rate hikes are likely to be appropriate over 
the next few years to sustain the economic expansion.  Indeed, FOMC participants have 
built such a gradual path of rate hikes into t heir projections for the next couple of years. 
Of course, policy is not on a preset course.  I have spoken about some of the 
uncertainties associated with the inflation outlook in particular, and we will be paying 
close attention to the inflation data in the months ahead.  But uncertainty about the 
outlook is by no means limited to inflation.  As always, the Committee will adjust the 
stance of monetary policy in response to incoming economic information and the 
evolution of the economic outlook to achieve i ts objectives of maximum employment and 
stable prices.  Moreover, we are mindful of the possibility that shifting expectations 
concerning the path of U.S. policy can lead to spillovers to other economies via financial 
markets and the value of the dollar.  We remain committed to communicating as clearly 
and effectively as possible to help mitigate the risk of sudden changes in the policy 
outlook among market participants that could spur unintended effects in global financial 
markets.  ",2017-10-15,yellen

at the 
 
United States-Mexico Chamber of Commerce Annual Gala 
 
Washington, D.C. 
       
May 12, 2011 
  
Good evening.  I am very pleased to join  the United States-Mexico Chamber of 
Commerce at this gala dinner as its member s look back on another year of working to 
build the mutually beneficial trade and investment relationship between our two 
countries.  The ties between Mexico and the United States, both economic and cultural, 
are close and enduring--in no small part, I am  sure, because of the nearly 40 years of 
effort by the chamber.  Thus, I am especia lly honored to join Agustín Carstens, the 
distinguished governor of the Bank of Mexic o, in receiving your Good Neighbor Award.  
Thank you very much.  Muchísimas gracias.  
I have benefited from many years of cont act and shared experiences with Agustín 
and his colleagues at the centr al bank of Mexico.  Some years ago, I had the opportunity 
to visit the Bank of Mexico.  As an economis t, I found the visit very stimulating.  But I 
must confess that I enjoyed the trip as mu ch for the cultural excursions as for the 
economics.  I remember in particular the b eauty of Diego Rivera’s monumental mural in 
the National Palace in Mexico City.  As w ith so many things, I credit my wife, Anna, 
who has a graduate degree in Latin Ameri can literature, for my greater-than-average 
appreciation for the arts of  Mexico and the other Latin American nations.  Perhaps 
Agustín might also credit hi s spouse, the writer Catherin e Mansell Carstens, for an 
appreciation of culture that encompasses both of our nations. 
I met Agustín not long after I came to Washington to serve on the Federal 
Reserve Board.  He was then a highly re garded deputy managing director of the 
International Monetary Fund.  In late 2006, not  long after I became Chairman, he became 
finance minister of Mexico, and last year he succeeded Guillermo Ortiz as governor of 
the Bank of Mexico.  We have had many opport unities to meet and share views about the  - 2 -
U.S., Mexican, and global economies.  My appr eciation for his wisdom and insight as an 
economist and policymaker has grown with each encounter. 
Our productive and, I hope, mutually bene ficial relationship reflects the close 
relationship of the United Stat es and Mexico.  Our countri es are tightly linked through 
trade.  The United States is by far Mexico’s  largest trading partner, accounting for about 
two-thirds of total Mexican merchandise trad e.  Mexico, in turn, accounts for about one-
eighth of the United States’ foreign trade, ranking it--along with Canada and China--
among our three largest trading partners.  Not surprisingly, then, the growth of the 
Mexican and U.S. economi es are strongly related. 
I’d be remiss if I concluded without  noting Mexico’s tremendous economic 
strides during the past two decades.  It has tamed the rampant inflation that prevailed 
before the 1990s, placed its budget on a s ounder footing, and avoided the repeated 
financial crises to which it was once prone.  Great credit goes to the thoughtful policies 
designed by Agustín and other economic leaders in Mexico.  Because the prosperity of 
our countries is so closely linked, we in the Un ited States benefit from their foresight and 
hard work. 
Our economies continue to face challenges that require mutual cooperation.  We 
are working together to promote internati onal financial stabilit y, both bilaterally and 
through international forums such as the Group of Twenty and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. 
In closing, I deeply appreciate receivi ng the chamber’s Good Neighbor Award.   
Agradezco profundamente su gentileza.  ",2011-05-12,bernanke

“Mortgage Foreclosures and the Future of Housing Finance ” 
 
a Joint Conference Sponsored by the Federal Reserve System  
and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  
 
Arlington , Virginia  
       
October 2 5, 2010  
    
Good morning .  It’s my pleas ure to welcome you  to this  joint conference of the 
Federal Reserve System and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ).  Our 
program over the next two days will highlight  policy -oriented research on U.S. housing 
and mortgage markets .  I would like to thank the many talented people throughout  the 
Federal Reserve System and at the FDIC who have worked together to make this 
conference a reality.  
Before I address the specific topics of this conference, I would like to note that  we 
have been concerned about  reported irregularities in foreclosure practices at a number of 
large financial institutions.  The  federal banking agencies are working together to 
complete an in -depth review of practices at the largest mortgage servicing ope rations.  
We are looking intensively at the firms’ policies, procedures, and internal controls related 
to forec losures and seek ing to determine  whether  systematic weaknesses are leading to 
improper foreclosures .  We take violat ions of proper procedures s eriously.  We anticipate 
preliminary r esults of the review next month.  In addition, Federal Reserve staff members  
and their counterparts at other federal agencies  are evaluating  the potential effects  of 
these problems on the real estate market  and financi al institutions . 
Any discussion of housing policy in this country must begin with some 
recognition of the importance Americans  attach to homeownership.  For m any of  us, 
owning a home signaled a passage into adulthood that coincided with the start of a career 
and family.   High levels of homeownership have been shown to foster greater 
involvement in school and civic organizations, higher graduation rates, and greater 
neighborhood stability .   - 2 - 
 
Recogni zing th ese benefit s, our society has  taken steps to  encourage 
home ownership.  Tax incentives, mortgage insurance from the Federal Housing 
Administration , and other government policies all contributed to a long rise in the U.S. 
homeownership rate --from 45 percent in 1940 to a peak of 69 percent in 2004.  But , as 
recent events have demonstrated,  homeownership is only good for families and 
communities if it can be sustained.  Home purchases that are very highly leveraged or 
unaffordable subject the borrower and lender to a great deal of risk.  Moreover, even  in a 
strong economy, unforeseen life events and risks in local real estate markets  make highly 
leveraged borrowers  vulnerable . 
It was ultimately very destructive when, in the early part of this decade, dubious 
underwriting practices and mortgage products inappropriate for many borrowers became 
more comm on.  In time, th ese practices and products  contributed to problems in the 
broader financial servi ces industry and helped spark a foreclosure crisis marked by  a 
tremendous upheaval in housing markets .  Now, more than 20 percent of borrowers owe 
more than their hom e is worth and an additional  33 percent have equity cushions of 10 
percent or less, putting them at risk should house prices decline much further.  With 
housing markets still weak, high levels of mortgage distress  may well persist for some 
time to come.  
In response  to the fallout from the financial crisis , the Fed has help ed stabilize the 
mortgage market and improve financial conditions more broadly, thus promoting 
economic recovery.  W hat may be less well  known, however, is what the Fed has been 
doing at the local level.  As the foreclosure crisis  has intensified, Federal Reserve staff i n 
our r esearch, community  development , and s upervision and r egulation divisions  have - 3 - 
 
actively collaborated to  support foreclosure prevention at the local level and promote  
neighborhood stabilization initiatives.  
A key initiative developed under  the leadership of Fed eral Reserve Bank of 
Chicago  President Charles Evans has been the Mortgage Outreach and Research Effort , 
known as MORE .  MORE  involves  all 12 Federal Reserve Banks and the Board of 
Governors in a collaborati on that pool s resources and combines expertise to inform and 
engage policymakers, community organizations, financial institutions, and the public  at 
large.  
The Fed is particularly well  suited to  such an effort .  Our community development 
experts are working on the ground to promote  fair and equal access to banking services 
and improve communit ies.  Further,  Federal Reserve staff members are conduct ing 
empirical research  on mortgage - and foreclosure -related topics , and are reaching out  to 
industry experts  as well .  We are focusing on the hardest -hit cities and regions of the 
country.  
A new publication released this week offers details about the MORE effort .  
Copies are available here today , and it is available online at the website of the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Chicago .1

discuss foreclosure issue s and develop solutions.  In some cases, alliances have been 
formed right on the spot to create and implement programs to keep people in their homes. 
We have also partner ed with the U.S . departments of Labor and Treasury and 
with the HOPE NOW Unemployment Taskforce to help  unemployed homeowners avoid 
losing their homes.  T his collaboration led to the creation of an online tool that allows 
homeowners and servicers to document unemployment insurance benefits as income in 
order to qua lify for federally sponsored mortgage modification programs.  
Each Federal Reserve Bank has an online Foreclosure Resource Center  with 
information on foreclosure -related resources , including an enhanced Foreclosure 
Mitigation Toolkit, which provides detaile d steps and information for localities seeking to 
develop foreclosure prevention activities .  The toolkit  also includes  a new Foreclosure 
Recovery Resource Guide, which helps consumers recover from the foreclosure process.  
A number of Federal Reserve resea rch projects also have  been initiated as part of 
the MORE program.  They include studies focusing on foreclosure prevention, financial 
education , and adverse neighborhood effects resulting from foreclosures.  You will  hear 
more about that research  over the next two days.  Community  development  researchers 
across the Federal Reserve System launched a study in 2009 of the planning and early 
implementation stages of the federal Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP).  
Research ers interview ed more th an 90 recipients of the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development’s  NSP funds in the fall of 2009.  These interviews and other data 
gathered during this study provide the first nationwide examination of the effect  of the 
NSP and served as  the basis for a number of Federal Reserve System reports currently in 
progress.  - 5 - 
 
Under the auspices of the MORE initiative, the Federal Reserve sponsor ed 
conferences such as th is one, and the summit held last month on Real Estate Owned and 
Vacant Property Strategies for Neighborhood Stabilization.  Participants at that meeting  
examined the community effects  of foreclosed and vacant properties with the  goal s of 
helping practitioners better understand barriers  to stabilizing neighborhoods , sharing 
practices  that show promise , and discussing regional differences.  As part of th at summit, 
the Federal Reserve released 17 papers analyzing trends, challenges, and possible 
solutions for addressing foreclosures and promoting neighborhood stabilization.  A few 
of the emerging solutions highlighted at the event were: a  national “first- look” property 
program, which gives nonprofits and municipalities the right of first refusal on 
repossessed properties to facilitate neighborhood stabilization; new methods of municipal 
code enforcement ; and innovative land- banking strategies.  We will be using these ideas 
and other s to inform our community development efforts over the coming year.  
To ensure that we have access to more detailed data on mortgage and credit 
markets, the Federal Reserve System has creat ed the Risk Assessment, Data Analysis , 
and Res earch , or RADAR , data warehouse.  This new platform  will help inform our 
monetary policy, bank supervision and regulation, and community development.   
Over the next two days , I understand that you will be hearing  about policy -
oriented research on the U.S. housing and mortgage markets --an area of first -order 
importance to policymakers.  You  will have the opportunity to discuss the current 
situation and the outlook for mortgage foreclosures, consider their consequences for 
neighborhoods , and evaluate efforts to mitigate foreclosures.  Also, y ou will learn results - 6 - 
 
from various studies that have examined mortgage modifications and factors that have led 
to defaults.  Finally , you will consider the future of housing finance .  
All the papers on the conference program  are of direct interest to policymakers 
and should lead to better -informed  policy .  I hope we can draw upon this information and 
the success of the MORE program to explore new and creative ways to address the 
foreclosure crisis .  At the Fed, we will continue to encourage further research, participate 
in discussions , and coordinate work among groups str iving for sustainable 
homeownership and the recovery of housing markets.

Thank you, President Sexton.  On behalf of the honorees, l et me express my 
thanks to NYU .  And c ongratulations from all of us to you, the Class of 2014, and to your 
families, especially your parents.  This is a special day to celebrate your achievements 
and to l ook forward to your lives  ahead.   
Your NYU education has not only provided you with a foundation of knowledge ; 
it has also , I hope , instilled in you a love of knowledge  and an enduring curiosity .  Life 
will continue to be a journey of discovery if you tend  the fires of curiosity that burn 
brightly in all of us.  
Such curiosity led Eric Kandel , here at NYU, to his  lifetime goal, to discover the 
chemical and cellular basis  of human memory .  A few years after his graduation, he was 
doing research  on cats.  But he had the idea of focusing on an animal with a simpler, 
more fundamental brain: the California sea  slug.  His colleagues all but ridiculed him for 
the idea.  They “knew ” that the study of the lowly sea slug was irrelevant for 
understanding human memory.  Kandel’s surg ically -skilled collaborator deserted him .   
To get  up to speed on sea  slugs, he had to go abroad to study .  But Kandel persisted and, 
in 2000, his curiosity won him the Nobel Prize .  It was , as you must have guessed, for 
deciphering the chemistry of memory i n humans, as revealed by his research on sea slugs.   
Kandel ’s life, I believe, demonstrates how a persistent curiosity can help us reach 
ambitious goals, even with great roadblocks in the way.    
A second tool  for life long intellectual growth  is a willingness to listen carefully to 
others. These days, technology allow s us access to a great breadth of perspectives , but it 
also allows us to  limit what voices we hear to the  narrow range we find most agreeable.   
Listening to others, especially  those with whom we disagree, tests  our own ideas and  - 2 - 
beliefs .  It forces us to recognize , with humility,  that we don’t have a monopoly on the 
truth.   
Yankee Stadium is a natural  venue for another lesson:  You won’t succeed all the 
time.   Even Ruth, Gehrig and DiMaggio failed most of  the time when they stepped to the 
plate .  Finding the right path  in life , more often than not, involves some missteps.   My 
Federal Reserve colleagues and I experienced this as we struggled to address a finan cial 
and economic crisis that threatened the global economy.  We brainstormed and designed 
a host of programs to unclog the plumbing of the financial system and to keep credit 
flowing.  Not everything worked but we kept at it , and we  remained focused on th e task 
at hand.  I learned the lesson during this period that one’s response  to th e inevitable 
setbacks matters as much as  the balance of victories and defeats.   
There is an unfortunate myth that success is mainly determined by something 
called “ ability .”  But research  indicates that our best measures of these qualities  are 
unreliable predictor s of performance in academics or employment.   Psychologist Angela 
Lee Duckwor th says that what really matters is a quality she calls “grit” --an abiding 
commitment to  work hard toward long -range goals and  to persevere through the setbacks 
that come along the way.    One aspect of grit that I think is particularly important is the willingness  to take a 
stand when cir cumstances demand it.  Such circumstances may not be all that frequent , 
but in every life, there will be crucial moments  when  having the courage to stand up for 
what you believe will be immensely important.   
 My predecessor at the Fed , Chairman Ben Bernanke , demonstrated such courage, 
especially in his response to the threat of the financial crisis .  To stabilize the financial  - 3 - 
system and restor e economic growth, he took courageous actions that were 
unprecedented in ambition and scope .  He f aced relentless criticism, personal threats, and 
the certainty  that history would judg e him harshly if he was wrong.  But he stood up for 
what h e believed was right and necessary .  Ben Bernanke ’s intelligence and knowledge  
served him well as Chairman .  But  his grit and willingness to take a stand were just as 
important.   I hope you never are confronted by challenges this great, but you  too will face 
moments in life when standing up for what you believe can make all the difference.    
 Having dwelt for a moment on failure and grit, let me turn to the deeper  meaning 
that underpins grit and can carry us beyond failure.  The hard work of building a life that 
makes a difference is much easier to sustain when you are passionate about what you pursue.  W hen I first came to the Federal Reserve 37 years ago,  I was struck by the 
passion of my colleagues for the mission of the  Fed.   And these many years later, each 
day at work , I see the importance of that passion to carrying out the Fed’s duties 
effectively .  If there is a job that  you feel passionate about, do what you can to pursue  that 
job; if there is a purpose about which you are passionate, dedicate yourself to  that 
purpose.  
 Finally, I hope that you can find joy in the lives you choose .  You are completing 
one important phase of your life today and embarking on an amazing new  adventure.  
Serious decisions about life surely lie ahead, but t ake the time to savor the  joys, large and 
small that come along the way .  Share those joys with others , and share a laugh when you 
can.    - 4 - 
In closing, thank you again, on behalf of myself and the other honorees .  Thank 
you for the opportunity to speak to you today .  Congratulations and good luck to the 
Class of 2014.     ",2014-05-21,yellen

Good afternoon.  Welcome to the room where members of the Board of 
Governors and the presidents of the 12 Reserve Banks meet eight times a year —most 
recently , two weeks ago —to decide the stance of monetary policy.  It’s a magnificent, 
formal —perhaps even imposing—room , with 26- foot ceilings, a monumental marble 
fireplace, and a 1,000- pound brass and glass chandelier.  It’s seen a lot of history since 
Franklin Roosevelt dedicated this building in 1937.  British and American military 
leaders conferred here during World Wa r II.  And, through the decades, our Federal 
Reserve predecessors grappled with financial turmoil and the economy’s ups and downs.  
So when my colleagues and I take our assigned places around this polished mahogany 
and granite table, the setting and its hi story lends a certain formality —dare I say, 
stuffiness—to the proceedings.  
As we kick off this 12th  of 14 Fed Listens events, Governor Brainard, Governor 
Bowman, and I hope that today’s meeting is anything but stuffy.  Candid and serious, 
yes.  But not stuffy.  The Reserve Banks and the Board have been holding Fed Listens 
events around the country as part of a comprehensive and public review of our monetary 
policy strategy, tools, and communications practices.  Almost all of the Fed Listens 
meetings, like t his one, have been open to the press and live -streamed on the i nternet.  
Both the breadth and transparency of the review are unprecedented for us.   
One reason we are conducting this review  is that i t is always a good practice for 
any organization to occas ionally take a step back and ask if it could be doing its job more 
effectively.  But we must pose that question not just to ourselves.  Because Congress has 
granted the Federal Reserve significant protections from short -term political pressures, 
we have an  obligation to clearly explain what we are doing and why.  And we have an  - 2 - 
obligation to actively engage the people we serve so that they and their elected 
representatives can hold us accountable.    
We’ve invited you here because we want to better understan d how monetary 
policy affects the lives of the people your organizations represent —union members, small  
business owners, residents of low - and moderate -income communities, retirees, and 
others.  W e want to hear your perspective on maximum employment and pr ice stability —
the monetary policy goals Congress has assigned us .  
Now is a good time to conduct the review .  Unemployment is near a half -century 
low, and inflation is running close to, but a bit below, our 2 percent objective.  While not 
everyone fully shares economic opportunities  and the economy faces some risks, overall 
it is—as I like to say —in a good place.  Our job is to keep it there as long as possible.  
While we believe our strategy and tools have been and remain effective, the U.S. 
economy, like other advanced economies around the world, is facing some longer -term 
challenges —from low growth, low inflation, and low interest rates.  While slow growth is 
obviously not good, you may be asking, “What’s wrong with low inflation and low 
interest rates?”  Low can be good, but when inflation—and, consequently, interest 
rates— are too low, the Fed and other central banks have less room to cut rates to support 
the economy during downturns.  
So, in this review, we are examining strategies that might better allow  us to 
symmetrically and sustainably achieve 2 percent inflation.  Doing so would help prevent 
inflation expectations among consumers, businesses, and investors from slipping too low, 
as they appear to have done in several advanced economies.  More- firmly anchored 
expectations, in a virtuous circle, would help keep actual inflation around our target, thus  - 3 - 
preserving our ability to change interest rates as appropriate to meet our mandate.  We are 
also looking at whether our existing monetary policy tools  will be adequate when the next 
downturn comes.  Finally, we are asking whether our communications practices can be 
improved to better support the effectiveness of our policy.  
After today, we have two Fed Listens sessions remaining, both later this month:  
one in Kansas City and another in Chicago.  At the July meeting of the Federal Open 
Market Committee, my colleagues and I began discussing what we’ve learned so far 
from  the Fed Listens events.  We continued that discussion at our September meeting and 
have a  lot left to do.  We plan to publicly report our conclusions during the first half of 
next year.  
One clear takeaway of the sessions so far is the importance of sustaining our 
historically strong job market.  People from low - and moderate -income communities  tell 
us this long recovery, now in its 11 th year, is benefiting them and their neighbors to a 
degree that has not been felt for many years.  Employers are partnering with community 
colleges and nonprofit organizations to offer training.  And people who ha ve struggled to 
stay in the workforce in the past are getting new opportunities.   
Once again, welcome.  Now it is your turn to speak.  We’re listening.  ",2019-10-04,powell

Thank you for inviting me  to join you t oday as part of this distinguished panel.   
Our subject is the relationship between “center country” monetary policy and 
global financial conditions , and the  policy implications of that r elationship both for the 
center country and for other countries affected.  This broad topic has been the subject of a 
great deal of research and discussion in recent years.  Today I will focus in particular on 
the role of U.S. monetary policy in driving gl obal financial conditions and capital flows.  
To preview my conclusions, I will argue that, while global factors play an important role 
in influencing domestic financial conditions, the role of U.S. monetary policy is often 
exaggerated.  And while financia l globalization does pose some challenges for monetary 
policy, efforts to build stronger and more transparent policy frameworks and a more 
resilient financial system  can reduce the adverse consequences of external shocks .   
The well -known Mundell -Fleming “ trilemma” states that it is not possible to have 
all three of the following things:  free  capital mobility, a fixed exchange rate, and the 
ability to pursue an independent monetary policy.  The trilemma does not  say that a 
flexible exchange rate will always fully insulate domestic economic conditions from 
external shocks.1  And , indeed, that is not the case.  We have seen that integration of 
global capital markets can make for difficult tradeoffs for some economies, whether  they 
have fixed or floa ting exchange rate regimes.   
Since the Fed is  the central bank of the world’s largest economy and issuer of the 
world’s most widely  used reserve currency, it is to be expected that the Fed’s policy 
actions will spill over to other economies.  To illustrate this point, the scatterplot on the 
left side of figure 1 focuses on movements in interest rates and exchange rates following 
                                                 
1 See, for example, Klein and Shambaugh (2013) and Obstfeld (2015).   - 2 - 
Federal Reserve policy announcements.  As you can see, changes in U.S. interest rates 
after Fed policy actions (shown on the hori zontal axis) lead to corresponding changes in 
the value of the dollar (shown on the vertical axis).  And because of the dollar’s 
widespread use around the world, these changes in the dollar affect financial conditions 
abroad.  Fed policy -related movements in U.S. bond yields also tend to spill over to bond 
yields abroad, such as the German yields shown in the scatterplot on the right.  Such 
spillovers are to be expected in a world of highly integrated financial markets .2  As figure 
2 shows, bond yields (lef t) and equity prices (right) around the world typically move 
together fairly closely.   
But the influence of U.S. monetary policy on global financial conditions should 
not be over stated .  The Federal Reserve is not the only central bank whose actions affect 
global financial markets.  In fact, the United States is the recipient as well as the 
originator of monetary policy spillovers.  For example, as seen in figure 3, changes in 
German yields after European Central Bank policy decisions also pass through to U.S. 
yields.3  More broadly, it is notable that although the Fed has raised its target interest rate 
six times since December 2015 and has begun to shrink its balance sheet, overall U.S. 
domestic financial conditions have gotten looser, in part due to impr oving global 
conditions and central bank policy abroad.   
Much of the discussion of the spillovers of U.S. monetary policy focuses on their 
effects on financial conditions in emerging market economies (EMEs).  S ome observers 
                                                 
2 See, for example, Adrian and others (2017) and the IMF’s most recent Global Financial Stability Report  
(2018) for discussion of the transmission of global risk shocks to domestic macroeconomic conditions.  
3 Curcuru, De  Pooter, and Eckerd (2018) find that about half of the movement in German bund yields in a 
window following ECB monetary policy announcements spills over to U.S. Treasury yields, roughly the 
same magnitude as the spillover of movements in U.S Treasury yields to German bund yields following 
Federal Reserve policy announcements.    - 3 - 
have attributed the movements i n international capital flow ing to EMEs since the G lobal 
Financial C risis primarily to monetary stimulus by the Fed and other advanced- economy 
central banks.4  The data do not seem to me to fit this narrative particularly well.  As 
illustrated by the blue dashed line in the left panel of figure 4, capital flows to EMEs 
were already very strong before the Global F inancial C risis, when the federal funds rate 
was comparatively high.  The subsequent surge in capital flows in 2009, as the crisis was 
abating, largely reflects a rebound from the  capital flow  interruption during the crisis 
itself, though highly accommodative monetary policies in advanced economies doubtless 
also played a role.  Moreover, capital flows to EMEs started to  ease after 201 1, a period 
when the Federal Reserve continued to add accommodation and reduce yields through 
increases in its balance sheet, as shown in the right panel.  And, more recently, capital 
flows to EMEs have picked up again despite the fact that the Fed has been removing 
accommodation since 2015.  
If U.S. monetary policy is not the major determinant, what other factors have been 
driving EME capital flows?  One prominent factor has been growth differentials between 
EMEs and advanced economies.  In f igure 5, the left panel shows that capital inflows to 
EMEs picked up post -crisis, in line with the widening of this growth differential, while 
the slowdown in inflows after 2011 coincides with its narrowing.  Another related 
determinant has been commodity prices, as shown in the right panel.  The pickup in both 
global growth and commodity prices over the past couple of years explains a good part of 
the recent recovery of capital flows to EMEs.5 
                                                 
4 See, for example, Wheatley and Garnham (2010) and Rajan (2014) . 
5 Studies looking at the determinants of EME capital flows include Chari and others (2017), Clark and 
others (2016), Bems and others  (2016), Koepke (201 5), Ahmed and Zlate (2014), Fratzscher (2012), and  - 4 - 
Monetary stimulus by the Fed and other advanced- economy centra l banks played 
a relatively limited role in the surge of capital flows to EMEs in recent years .  There is 
good reason to think that  the normalization of monetary policies in advanced economies 
should continue to prove manageable for EMEs.  Fed policy norma lization has proceeded  
without disruption to financial markets , and market participants’ expectations for policy 
(the red symbols  in figure 6) seem reasonably well  aligned with policymakers’ 
expectations in the Summary of Economic Projections (the black dots), suggesting that 
markets should not be surprised by our actions  if the economy evolves in line with 
expectations .   
It also bears emphasizing that the EMEs themselves have made considerable 
progress in reducing vulnerabilities since the crisis- prone 1980s and 1990s.  Many EMEs 
have substantially improved the ir fiscal and monetary policy frameworks  while adopting 
more flexible exchange rates, a policy that recent research shows provides better 
insulation from external financial shocks.6  Corporate debt  at risk--the debt of firms with 
limited debt service capacity --has been rising in EMEs, as shown in f igure 7.7  But this 
rise has been relatively limited outside of China and has begun to reverse as stronger 
global growth has pushed up earnings.    
                                                 
Ghosh and others (2012).  These papers generally conclude that many factors, including both “pull” and 
“push, ” affect EME capital flows.  
6 See, for example, Obstfeld, Ostry, and Qureshi (2017).  The resul ts in IMF (2017) also indicate that while 
global financial conditions explain a significant portion of countries’ domestic financial conditions, 
domestic monetary policy changes also play an important role in economies with flexible exchange rates.   
7 The interest c overage ratio (ICR) is the ratio of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and 
amortization to interest expense.  A value of 2 or less is typically associated with an increased likelihood of 
distress.  For example, just before the Asian fi nancial crisis, firms in Korea, Thailand, and Indonesia had an 
average ICR of 2; see Pomerleano (1998) .   
     For more on evolution of EME debt at risk and vulnerabilities, see Powell (2017).   - 5 - 
All tha t said, I do not dismiss the prospective  risks emanating from global policy 
normalization.  Some investors and institutions may not be well positioned for a rise in 
interest rates, even one that markets broadly anticipate .  And, of course, future economic 
conditions may surprise us, as they often do.   
  Moreover, t he linkages among monetary policy, asset prices, and the mood of 
global financial markets  are not fully understood.  Some observers have argued that U.S. 
monetary policy also influences capital f lows through its effects on global risk sentiment, 
with looser policy leading to more positive sentiment in markets and tighter policy 
depressing sentiment.8  While those channels may well operate, research at both the Fed 
and the I MF suggest s that actions  by major central banks account for only a relatively 
small fraction of global financial volatility and capital flow movements.9 
Nevertheless, r isk sentiment  will bear close watching as normalization proceeds 
around the world.  What can the Federal Reserve do to foster continued financial stability 
and economic growth as normalization proceeds?  We will communicate our policy 
strategy as clearly and transparently as possible to help align expectations and avoid 
market disruptions.  And we will continue to h elp build resilience in the financial system  
and support global efforts to do the same . 
  
                                                 
8 Rey (2015) ; Miranda -Agrippino  and Rey (2015) .   
9 For example , Londono and Wilson (2018) find that U.S. monetary policy variables account for only 
roughly 10 percent of the six- month ahead forecast error variance of the VIX .  In fact, in their study, non -
U.S. global factors (non -U.S industrial production, a global E conomic Policy Uncertainty Index, and the 
expected probability of recessions outside of the United States) explain nearly as much of the VIX forecast 
error variance as U.S. monetary policy and other U.S. variables combined.  In addition, Cerutti, Claessens , 
and Rose (2017) find that directly observed variables in “center” countries (including VIX), as well as 
unobserved common dynamic factors extracted from actual capital flows, together rarely explain more than 
one-fourth of the variation in most types of capital flows.    - 6 -

February 6, 2019 
  
Thank you to all the educators who are here with us in Washington or are joining 
us online .  I look forward to responding to your questions.  But first, I have a few 
thoughts about the vital work  you do as economics educators  and its connection to what 
the Federal Reserve is trying to accomplish.  I promise to be brief, because it is a school 
night.  
I am here today, and the Fed has organized this event, because of the importance 
of economics education .  Some of your students may go on to become professional 
economists, but all of them , I hope, will apply the valuable lessons and the skills they 
have gained from economics in other careers and in others aspects of their lives.   
Studying economics can benefit students in multiple ways.   The lessons of 
economics are valuable in a wide variety of vocations .  Moreover, the knowledge gain ed 
will empower students as consumers, managers of their own finances, and as informed 
citizens.  Economics has been consistently useful to me over my career in law, finance, 
and government  service.  It is, of course, central to my current role as a monetary 
policymaker and financial regulator.   
In government, economic  analysi s is one of the principa l tools  we use in making 
policy decisions.  Among other things, economics  is an essential facet of the science of 
public policy.  What policies actually work?  Which ones sound good but don’t work, or 
are actually counter -productive?  Economics gives us th e tools to answer those questions 
and help us make the best the decisions on behalf of the public.  
Of course, economics is not only the basis for judgments and decisions made by 
the Fed and other government agencies.  It also underpins  the countless decisi ons by 
consumers, businesses, and investors that drive  economic activity.  The concepts you  - 2 - 
teach and apply in the classroom guide those decisions and even help explain human 
behavior outside of  the workings of the economy.  For example, to continue to grow and 
succeed, any business owner should understand the differences between fixed cost, 
variable cost, average cost , and marginal cost.  Businesses and investors need to 
understand present or discounted value, but so should any parent or grandparent starti ng a 
college fund.  Economics teaches us about the power of incentives, which are central to 
thinking about and understanding regulatory and tax policy.  B ut incentives also help 
motivate people in a variety of other settings, such as encouraging students to do their 
best in school, helping reduce traffic jams, or even nudging someone to save more or to 
exercise regularly.  Economics is a practical and powerful tool for understanding how we 
relate to each other .   
And that’s why what you do for your student s is so important .  Like all teachers, 
you are helping prepare them for success in life.  The knowledge you impart and the 
intellect and talents you help develop are tools that your students can use to achieve that 
success.  E conomics teaches analytical an d critical thinking skills useful to anyone .  Part 
of your students’  success is their economic success as capable, creative, and productive 
members of the workforce and as consumers adept at managing their finances.  Your 
students benefit from this education, but so does everyone else in society.  We all benefit 
when better -educated citizens support economic policies that help  our nation prosper.  
We all benefit from the capability, creativity , and productivity  of our workforce, because 
nothing is more important to a healthy and growing economy.  Responsible consumers 
skilled in managing their finances are better prepared to wea ther bad times, and stronger 
household finances overall can help sustain economic growth and mitigate a downturn.  - 3 - 
Stabilizing growth and mit igating a downturn, of course, are  aspects of the 
Federal Reserve’s mission.  Monetary policy can be  a powerful tool  to achieve these  
ends, but, in truth, its powers are dwarfed by larger forces, such as the productivity of the 
American people and the strength of their finances.  By educating students and 
supporting their future contributions to the economy as workers a nd consumers, all 
teachers, especially economics teachers, are furthering our goals at the Fed, so let me 
offer my further thanks for making our job easier.  
To help support your work as teachers, the Federal Reserve Board and the 
12 Reserve Banks conduct programs, organize events , and publish books to spread 
knowledge of economics, financial literacy, and the role of the Fed in promoting a 
healthy economy and financial system.  You can find some of those resources at our 
websites:  F ederal Reserve.gov and F ederal Reserve Education.org.   
Each of the Reserve Banks has community outreach and educational initiatives, 
and the outreach to economics teachers is coordinated by the System Economic 
Education Group, which has been chaired by Princeton Williams.  
At the Board  of Governors , for some years we have operated a program called 
FedEd, which sends Board employees into high schools throughout the Washington, 
D.C. , area.  This outreach depends on several dozen volunteers from our staff --typically , 
recent college gr aduates --who help teach about the Fed, economics and finance, and 
answer questions about work opportunities at the Board.  The Federal Reserve is 
dedicated to promoting diversity in our ranks and in the economics profession, and FedEd 
and other programs ac ross the Federal Reserve System  have  helped advance this goal by 
reaching many schools with significant numbers of minority students.   - 4 - 
Let me leave it there, and  again thank you for participating in this town hall, and 
thank you for the valuable work you do every school day.

Premiere of Marriner Eccles:  Father of the Modern Federal Reserve  
 
Salt Lake C ity, Utah  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
October 7, 2019 
  
Thank you, Randy, for the kind introduction.  It is a great pleasure to join you all 
this morning for the premiere of KUED’s documentary Marriner Eccles:  F ather of the 
Modern Federal Reserve.   It is also a great pleasure to be in Utah.  It has been a long time 
since a Fed Chair made an official visit to Utah.  Alan Greenspan spoke in Salt Lake City 
22 years ago.  All of the Utahns here know  about the Eccles family’s enormous 
contributi ons to building the economies of the state and the region.  The documentary 
will remind us of Marriner’s immense contribution not just to the region, but also to our 
nation during the Great Depression, World War II, and there after.  
Many Eccles family members are present here today.  I would like to especially 
recognize Marriner’s grandson, Chip Eccles; Marriner’s nephew, Spencer Eccles; and 
Spencer’s daughter, Hope Eccles.  Randy was fortunate to marry Hope , and he has a 
second Federal Reserve connection.  He is our Vice Chair for Supervision.   
In a way, I feel that I know Marriner , too.  I work in a building named after him.  I 
sit in the office where he sat as Chair.  And his portrait hangs in a room where I 
frequently meet with guests, Board colleagues, and staff.  When I sit in my usual seat, he 
stands, looking over my left shoulder, an enigmatic expression —neither approving nor 
disapproving—on his face.  Talk about pressure!  
More seriously, his legacy endures in much more than a name on a building and a 
portrait on a wall.  As the Depression deepened, he presciently recognized that the federal 
government should act forcefully to put people back to work and stimulate business.  In a 
speech delivered  here in Utah  in 193 2, Marriner asked what was the purpose of an 
economic system if not to allow those willing and able to work the opportunity to do so, 
to “guarantee to them sustenance for their families and protection against want and  - 2 - 
destitution.”1  His ideas helped form the basis of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal and 
anticipated the not -yet-published tenets of British economist John Maynard Keynes.  
After World War II, he recognized, again presciently, that high inflation, not c ontraction, 
posed the principa l threat to the U.S. economy.  
And, perhaps most importantly from my perspective as Fed Chair, he is 
responsible more than any other person for the fact that the United States today has an 
independent central bank—a central ban k able to make decisions in the long- term best 
interest of the economy, without regard to the political pressures of the moment.  During 
his years on the Fed Board, Marriner played a crucial role in two landmark 
accomplishments that established the modern Federal Reserve—the Banking Act of 
1935, near the start of his tenure at the Fed, and the Federal Reserve -Treasury Accord of 
1951, at the end. 
FDR nominated Marriner to lead the Fed Board in 1934.  He accepted on the 
condition that Roosevelt support a rest ructuring of the Fed, which had failed to counter 
the contraction gripping the nation’s economy.  The result was the Banking Act of 1935, 
which  significantly strengthened the structural independence of the Federal Reserve.  
And, symbolically important, it authorized the Board to move its meetings from the 
Treasury Department to a new building—the building that now bears Marriner’s name —
on Constitution Avenue, across from the Lincoln Memorial. 
During World War II, the Fed effectively ceded control of monetar y policy to the 
Treasury Department by agreeing to maintain a low interest rate peg on government 
                                                 
1 See Marriner S. Eccles (1932), “Depression:  Its Causes, Effects and Suggested Remedies,” speech 
delivered at the Utah State Bankers Convention, June 17, Marriner S. Eccles Papers, FRASER, Federal 
Reserve Bank of St. Louis, pp. 6– 7, https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/archival/1343/item/463025 .   - 3 - 
bonds.  The low rates helped the government finance the war, but after the war ended, 
inflation soared.  It subsided for a time but, with the Korean War, spiked again.  In 1951, 
Marriner led other Board members in precipitating a clean break with the peg 
arrangement, laying the foundation for the modern Fed.  The Federal Reserve -Treasury 
Accord of that year separated government debt management from monetary pol icy and 
freed the Fed to combat high inflation and set short -term interest rates based  on what was 
best for the economy.  
Those are just the highlights of Marriner’s Fed career.  You will learn much  more 
in the film we are about to see.  In closing, I leave  you with this statement from Marriner, 
inscribed on a plaque in the Eccles Building:  “The management of the central bank must 
be absolutely free from the dangers of control by politics and by private interests, singly 
or combined.”  ",2019-10-07,powell

Grand Opening of the Junior Achievement Finance Park  
 
Fairfax,  Virginia  
       
October 19, 2010   
 Financial education helps young people cultivate a sen se of financial 
responsibility .  It is essential for their personal  well -being , and for the effective 
functioning of our economy .   
Junior Achievement was founded in 1919 and continues to be one of the world’s 
largest and fastest -growing organizations  dedicated to educating youth in financial 
literacy, work readiness, and entrepreneu rship .  It is commit ted to relevant, hands -on 
learning for students  from kindergarten through high school .  It serves 10 million students 
each year in 121 countries --about 50,000 of them here in the Washington, D.C., area .  I 
applaud Junior Achievement’s m ission , which is  to inspire and prepare young people to 
succeed in a global economy and cultivate their understanding of the principles of 
market -based economics and entrepreneurship .   
We are here today to discover Junior Achievement’s Finance Park  in Fairfax 
County .  It is the 15th such facility in the United States and will serve 14,000 students 
annually .  The program offers an intensive six -week classroom curriculum, followed by a 
capstone day at the Finance Park where students participate in a practical  personal 
budgeting simulation.   This experiential facility  helps  students build financial skills  that 
are essential to a successful financial future.  Students  immers e themselves in  reality -
based decisionmaking .  They practice essential household skills by developing a budget 
that includes housing, transportation, food, utilities, health care, investments, philanthropy, a nd banking .  The opportunity will enable them to better navigate real -life 
decisions . 
I applaud the ongoing partnership among Junior Achievement, schools, and 
businesses in the greater Washington area.  As states and school districts around the - 2 - 
 
 country continue to integrat e personal finance instruction into their curricula, 
organizations like Junior Achievement can provide important services to both students 
and teachers .  Thank you for inviting me to participate in today’s event. ",2010-10-19,bernanke

“Policy Options for Sustainable and Inclusive Growth”  
38th Annual Economic Policy Conference  
National Association for Business Economics  
 
Washington, D.C.  
       
March 21, 2022   
Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today.  
Let me first pause to recognize the millions who are suffering the tragic 
consequences of Russia’s inva sion of Ukraine .  
At the Federal Reserve, our monetary policy is guided by the dual mandate  to 
promote maximum e mployment and stable prices .  From th at standpoint , the current 
picture is plain to see:  The labor market  is very strong, and inflation is much too high.  
My colleagues and I are ac utely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, 
especially o n those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and 
transportation.  There is an obvious need to move expedit iously to  return the stance of 
monetary policy to a more neutral level, and then to move to more restrictive levels if  that 
is what is required to restore price stability.  We are committed to restoring price stability 
while preserving a strong labor market.  
At our meeting that  concluded last week, we took several steps in pursuit of these 
goals:  We raised our policy in terest rate for the first time since the start of the pandemic 
and said  that we anticipate that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate  to reach our 
objectives.  We also said  that we expect to  begin reducing the size of our balance sheet at 
a coming mee ting.  In my press conference, I noted that  action  could come as soon as our 
next meeting in May , though that is not a decision that we  have made.   These actions, 
along with the adjustments we have made since last fall, represent a substantial firming in 
the stance of policy with the intention of restoring price stability.  In my comments today, I will first discuss the economic conditions that warran t these actions and then address th e 
path ahead for monetary policy.   - 2 - 
 
The L abor Market I s Very  Strong and Extremely  Tight 
To begin with employment, in the last few years of the historically long expansion 
that ended with the arrival of the pandemic, we saw the remarkable benefits of an 
extended period of strong labor market conditions.  We seek to foster another long 
expansion in order to realize those benefits again.   
The labor market has substantial momentum.  Employment growth powered 
through the  difficul t Omicron wave, adding 1.75 million jobs over the past three months.  
The unemployment rate has fallen to 3.8 percent,  near historic al lows, and ha s reached 
this level much faster than anticipated by most forecasters (figure 1) .  While disparities in 
emplo yment remain, j ob growth has been widespread across racial, ethnic, and 
demographic  groups .  
By many measures, the labor market is extremely tight , significantly tighter than 
the very strong job market  just before the pandemic .  There are far  more job openings  
going unfilled  today than before  the pandemic , despite today’s  unemployment rate being 
higher.  I ndeed, there  are a record 1.7 posted job openings for each person who is looking 
for wor k.  R ecord numbers of people are quitting jobs each month, typically to take 
another job with higher pay.  And nominal wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades,  
with the gains strongest for those at the lower end of the wage distribution  and among 
production and nonsupervisory workers  (figure 2 ).   
It is worth considering why the  labor market is so tight,  given that the 
unemployment rate  is actually higher than it was before the pandemic .  One explanation 
is that the natural rate of unemployment may be  temporarily elevated, so wage pressure is 
greater  for a ny given level of unemployment.  The sheer volume of hiring may have  - 3 - 
 
taxed the capacity of the market to bring workers and jobs together.  The Delta and 
Omicron variants complicated hiring, and the strong financial position of households may 
have allowed some to be more selective in their job search.   Over time, we might expect 
these factors to fade, reducing pressure in the job market.  
A second source of l abor market tightness is  that the  labor force participation rate 
dropped sharply in the pandemic and has only partly recovered.  As  a result, the labor 
force remains below its pre -pandemic trend (figure  3).  Total demand for labor , measured 
by total employ ment plus posted job openings, has  substantially recovered  and far 
exceed s the size of the workforce .   
About half of th e shortfall in labor force participation is  attributable to retirements 
during the pandemic.1  History suggests that most of those reti rees are unlikely to reenter 
the workforce .  But some nonparticipation is due to factors  that may fade with time,  such 
as caregiving needs and fear of cont racting COVID- 19.  W ith prime -aged participation 
still well below its pre -pandemic level , there is ro om for further progress .  A more 
complete rebound is , however, likely to take some time .  Increases in l abor force 
participation  often  substantially lag declines in unemployment .   
Overall, the labor market is strong but showing a clear imbalance of supply and 
demand.  Our monetary policy tools cannot help with labor supply in the near term , but in 
a long expansion, the factors holding back supply wi ll likely ease .  In the meantime, we 
aim to use our tools to moderate demand growth, thereby facilitating continued, 
sustainable increases in employment and wages.

The I nflation O utlook Has Deteriorated S ignificantly  
Turning to price stability, the inflation outlook had deteriorated sig nificantly this 
year even before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.    
The rise in i nflation has been much greater and more persistent than forecasters 
generally  expected.  For example, at the time of our June 2021 meeting, every Federal 
Open Market Committee (FOMC)  participant and all but one of 35 submissions in the 
Survey of Professional Forecasters predicted that 2021 inflation would be below 4 
percent .  Inflation came in at 5.5 percent.2  
For a time, moderate inflation forecast s looked plaus ible—the one -month 
headline and core inflation rate s declined steadily from April  through September .  But 
inflation moved up sharply in the fall, and , just since our December meeting , the median 
FOMC projection for year -end 2022 jumped from 2.6 percent to 4.3 percent.  
Why have forecasts been so far off?  In my view, an important part of the 
explanation is that forecasters widely underestimat ed the severity and persistence of 
supply- side frictions , which, when combined with strong demand, especia lly for durable 
goods, produced surprisingly high inflation.    
The pandemic  and the associated shutdown and reopening of the economy caused 
a serious upheaval in many parts  of the economy, snarling supply chains, constraining 
labor supply, and creating a major boom in demand for goods and a bust in s ervices 
demand.  The combination of the surge in goods demand with  supply chain bottlenecks 
 
2 This is headline personal consumption expenditures inflation on a Q4/Q4 basis.  The Survey of 
Professional Forecasters statistic is a count by the authors using the second quarter 2021 survey.  The data

led to sharply rising  goods prices (figure 4).  The most notable example here is motor 
vehicles.  Prices soared  across the vehicles sector as b ooming demand was met by a sharp 
decline in global production during the summer of 2021, owing to shortages of computer 
chips .  Production remains below pre -pandemic levels, and an expected sharp decline in 
prices has been repeated ly postponed.    
Many  forecasters, including FOMC participants , had been expecting inflation to 
cool in the second half of last year, as the economy started going back to normal after vaccines became widely  available.
3  Expectations were that the supply- side damage 
would begin to heal.  Schools would reopen—freeing parents to return to work—and labor supply would begin bouncing back, kinks in supply chains would begin resolving, 
and consumption would start rotating back to services, all of which could reduce price pressures.  While schools are open,  none of the  other expectations has  been fully met .  
Part of the reason may be that , contrary to expectations, COVID has not gone away with 
the arrival of vaccines .   In fact, we are now headed once again into more COVID- related 
supply disruptions from China.  It continues to seem likely that hoped- for supply- side 
healing will come over time as the world ultimately settles into some new normal, but  the 
timing and scope of that r elief are highly uncertain.  In the meantime,  as we set policy , 
we will be looking to actual  progress on these issues and not assuming  significant near -
term supply -side relief.    
The P olicy Response 
As the magnitude  and persistence of the increase in inflation  became increasingly 
clear  over the second half of last year , and as the job market recovery accelerated beyond

expectations , the FOMC pivoted to progressively less accommodative monetary policy.  
In June, the median FOMC parti cipant projected that the federal funds rate would remain 
at its effective lower bound through the end of 2022, and as the news came in, the 
projected policy paths shifted higher  (figure 5) .  The median projection that accompanied 
last week’s 25 basis poin t rate increase shows the federal funds rate at 1.9 percent by the 
end of this year and rising above its estimated longer -run normal value in  2023.  The 
latest FOMC statement  also indicates that the Committee expects to begin reducing the 
size of our balan ce sheet at a coming meeting.  I believe that these policy actions and 
those to come will help bring inflation down near 2 percent over the next 3 years.  
As always, our  policy projections are not a C ommittee decision or fixed plan.  
Instead, they are a su mmary of what the FOMC participants see as the most likely case 
going forward.  T he events of the past four  week s remind us  that, in tumultuous times , 
what seems like the most likely scenario may change quite quickly :  Each S ummary of 
Economic Projections  reflects  a point in time and can become outdated quickly at times 
like these, when events are developing rapidly.    
Thus, my main message today is  that, as the outlook evolves, we will adjust 
policy as needed in orde r to e nsure a return to price stability with a strong job market .  
Let me now turn  to three questions about the likely evolution of policy.  
How will fallout from the invasion of Ukraine aff ect the economy and monetary 
policy?  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine may  have significant effects on the world economy 
and the U.S. economy.  The  magnitude and persistence of these effects remain highly 
uncertain and depend on events yet to come .    - 7 - 
 
Russia is one of the world’s largest producers of commodities , and Ukraine is a 
key producer of several commodities  as well , including wheat and neon, which is used in 
the production of computer chips .  There is no recent experience with significant market 
disrupti on across such a broad range of commodities.  In addition to the direct effects 
from higher global oil and commodity prices, the invasion and related events are likely to 
restrain economic activity abroad and further disrupt supply chains, which would crea te 
spillovers to the U.S. economy.   
We might look to the historical experience with oil price shocks in the 1970s —
not a happy story.  Fortunately, the United S tates is now much better situated to weather 
oil price shocks.4  We are now the world’s largest producer of oil, and our economy is 
significantly less oil intensive  than in the 1970s .  Today a rise in oil prices has mixed 
effects on the economy, lowering real household incomes and thus demand, but  raising  
investment i n drilling over time and benefiting oil -producing areas more generally.  On 
net, oil shocks tend to weigh on output in the U.S. economy, but  by far less than in the 
1970s.   
Second, how likely is it that monetary policy can lower i nflation without c ausing a 
recession?   Our goal is to restore price stability while fostering another long expansion 
and sustaining a strong labor market .  In the  FOMC participant  projections  I just 
described, the economy achieves a soft landing, with inflation coming down and 
unemployment holding steady.  Growth slows as the very fast growth from the early 
 
4 I discussed this topic more fu lly in Jerome H. Powell (2019), “Data -Dependent Monetary Policy in an 
Evolving Economy,” speech delivered at “Trucks and Terabytes:  Integrating the ‘Old’ and ‘New’ 
Economies,” 61st Annual Meeting of the National Association for Business Economics, Denver,  Colo., 
October 8, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20191008a.htm .  - 8 - 
 
stages of reopening fades, the effects of fiscal support wane, and monetary policy 
accommodation is removed.  
Some have argued that  history s tacks the odds against achieving a soft landing, 
and point to the 1994 episode as the  only successful soft landing in the postwar period .  I 
believe that the historical record provides some  grounds  for optimism :  Soft, or at least 
soft-ish, landings have b een relatively common in U.S. monetary  history.5  In three 
episodes —in 1965, 1984, and 1994—the Fed raised the federal funds rate significantly  in 
response to perceived overheating without precipitating a recession (figure 6).6  In other 
cases, recessions chronologically followed the conclusion of a tightening cycle, but the recessions w ere not apparently due to excessive tightening  of monetary policy .  For 
example, the tightening from 2015 to 2019 was followed by the pandemic -induced 
recession.
7 
I hasten to add that no one expect s that bringing about a soft landing will be 
straightforward in the current context —very little is straightforward in  the current 
context .  And monetary policy is often said to be a blunt instrument, not capable of 
surgical precision.  My colleagues and I will do our very best to succeed in this challenging task.  It is worth noting that t oday t he economy is very strong and is well 
positioned to handle tighter monetary policy.   
 
5 See Alan Blinder (2022), “Landings Hard and Soft:  The Fed, 1965 –2020,” slides f rom a presentation 
delivered at Markus’ Academy, Bendheim Center for Finance, Princeton University, Princeton, N.J., 
February 11, https://bcf.princeton.edu/wp- content/ uploads/2022/01/Combined -Slides.pdf .   
6 I have identified these episodes by a single important year in the tightening cycle, but in each case , the 
period of tightening spanned more than one year.  
7 As I argued  more fully  in a pr evious speech , while the postwar recessions up through 1981 were arguably 
the result of stop -and-go policy, none of the recessions since then fit that mold so clearly ; see Jerome H. 
Powell (2018), “Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy,” speech delivered at “Changing Market 
Struct ure and Implications for Monetary Policy,” a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Kansas City, held in Jackson Hole, Wyo., August 24, https://www.federalrese rve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm .    - 9 - 
 
Finally, w hat will it take to restore price stability ?  The ultimate responsibility for 
price stability rests with the Federal Reserve.  Price stability is essential if we are going to 
have another sustained period of strong labor market conditions.  I believe that the policy 
approach that I have laid out  is well  suited to achieving this outcome .  We will take the 
necessary steps to ensure a return to price stability.  In particular, if we co nclude that it is 
appropriate to move more aggressively by raising the federal funds rate by more than 25 basis points at a meeting or meetings, we will do so.  And if we determine that we need to 
tighten beyond common measures of neutral  and into a more r estrictive stance, we will 
do that as well.     
  Our monetary policy framework, as embodied in our S tatement o n Longer -Run 
Goals and Monetary P olicy S trategy , emphasizes that having longer -term inflation 
expectations anchored at our longer -run objective of 2 percent helps us achieve both our 
dual-mandate objectives.  While we cannot measure longer -term expectations directly, 
we monitor a variety of survey - and market- based indicators.  In the recent period, short -
term inflation expectations have, of course, risen with inflation , but l onger -run 
expectations  remain well  anchored in their historical ranges (figure 7).   
The added near -term upward pressure from the  invasion of  Ukraine on inflation 
from energy, food, and other commodities comes at a time of already too high inflation .  
In normal times, when employment and inflation are close to our objectives, monetary 
policy would look through a brief burst of inflat ion associated with commodity price 
shocks.  However, the risk is rising that an extended period of high inflation could push longer -term expectations uncomfortably higher, which underscores the need for the 
Committee to move expeditiously as I have descri bed. - 10 - 
Conclusion   
The past t wo ye ars have be en extraordinarily challenging for many Americans.  
Two years ago, more than 20 million people were losing their jobs , millions w ere fa lling 
ill, and lives were being disrupted.  We have made enormous strides since then .  Today, 
as I have discussed, the labor market is very strong.  But, to end w here I began, i nflation 
is much too high.  We have the necessary  tools, and we will use them to restore price 
stability.

The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s 2014 Financial Markets Conference 
 
Atlanta , Georgia  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
April  15, 2014 
  
Good m orning.  I’m delighted to have this  opportunity to speak to you today , even 
though I am unable to be with you in person.  I’d like to share  a few thoughts about  the 
important issues that the Financial Markets Conference (FMC)  is addressing this year.  
Many of these issues, of course, are ones the FMC has grappled with every year since the  
crisis , an event which  elevated the importance of this gathering  and of the vital 
contributions made by the research and the policy discussion the FMC  fosters .  
One of those issues  is liquidity.  Maturity transformation is a central part of the 
economic function of banks and many other types of financial intermediaries.  But as we 
saw in the  crisis, maturity  transformation also exposes intermediaries to liquidity risk, 
particularly when intermediaries are heavily reliant on short -term wholesale funding.  In 
2007 and 2008, short -term creditors ran from firms such as Northern Rock, Bear Stearns, 
and Lehman Brother s, and from money market mutual funds and asset -backed 
commercial paper  programs .  Together, these runs were the primary engine of  a financial 
crisis from which the United States and the  global economy ha ve yet to fully recover.   
In response to the crisis, the Basel Commit tee on Banking Supervision’s first task 
was to strengthen bank capital requirements through the adoption of the Basel III capital 
accord  and, last summer , our domestic rule implementing th e Basel III capital 
requirements in the United States .  Strong bank capital rules remain the foundation of 
bank regulation.  But capital requirements as currently constructed are generally based on credit and market risks from the asset side of the balance sheet and from off -balance-
sheet transactions.  They do not directl y address liquidity risk.  
Thus, the Basel Committee’s second task was to develop new liquidity standards 
for global banking firms: the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and the Net Stable  - 2 - 
Funding Ratio (NSFR).  The LCR is designed to improve a bank’s ability  to withstand 
severe short -term liquidity stress events by requiring banking firms to hold a buffer of 
highly liquid assets to cover net cash outflows in a 30- day stress scenario.  The NSFR is 
meant to promote resilience over a one -year horizon by requirin g banks that hold less 
liquid assets to fund their activities with more stable sources of funding.  
As others have observed, the new Basel liquidity standards address financial 
stability risks associated with excessive maturity transformation through at le ast two 
channels.   
First, the new standards insulate banks from liquidity shocks.  In the case of the 
LCR, requiring firms to hold a buffer of highly liquid assets will help to ensure that they 
have a means of generating liquidity in the event of creditor  runs.  In the case of the 
NSFR, requiring firms to use higher levels of stable funding for less liquid assets reduces the vulnerabilities of a firm to structural maturity mismatch es.  Banking firms that self -
insure against liquidity risk in these ways are  less likely to need government liquidity 
support in times of stress. 
Second, the new standards provide an incentive for firms to move to more stable 
funding structures .  Under the LCR and NSFR, firms that engage in unstable forms of 
maturity transformatio n will be required to maintain buffers of highly liquid assets and 
use stable funding, both of which will impose cost s for the firms.   Reducing the amount 
of maturity transformation they engage in will help firms minimize these costs.  
While the LCR  and NSFR are important steps forward, they do not fully address 
the financial stability concerns associated with short -term wholesale funding.  These 
standards tend to focus on the liquidity positions of firms taken in isolation, rather than  - 3 - 
on the  financial sys tem as a whole.  They only apply to internationally active banks, and 
not directly to shadow banks, despite the fact that liquidity shocks within the shadow 
banking system played a major role in the crisis.  Furthermore, the current version s of the 
LCR and  NSFR do not address financial stability risks associated with so- called matched 
books of securities financing transactions.   
Federal Reserve staff are actively considering additional measures that could 
address these and other residual risks in the short -term wholesale funding markets.  Some 
of these measures --such as requiring firms to hold larger amounts of capital, stable 
funding, or highly liquid assets based on use of short -term wholesale funding --would 
likely apply only to the largest, most complex banking  organizations.  Other measures --
such as minimum margin requirements for repurchase agreements and other securities 
financing transactions --could, at least in principle, apply on a marketwide basis.  In 
designing such measures, we are carefully thin king through questions about the tradeoffs 
associated with tighter liquidity regulation that will be discussed at this conference.  
While these cost -benefit questions are difficult to answer with either certainty or 
precision, let me highlight one data point that suggests that there may be net social gains from introducing further reforms to address short -term wholesale funding risks .  In 2010, 
the Basel Committee assessed the long -term economic impact of stronger capital and 
liquidity requirements for globa l banks.  Factoring in the Basel III  capital requirements 
and the NSFR, the Basel study suggested that tightening risk -based capital and liquidity 
requirements would, on net, provide economic benefits , and that benefits would continue 
to accrue at even hig her levels of risk -based capital than are part of Basel III.     - 4 - 
While it would be a mistake to give undue weight to any one study, this study 
provides some support for the view that there might be room for stronger capital and 
liquidity standards for large banks than have  been  adopted so far .   
As the Board continues to weigh such steps to further strengthen the financial 
system, I expect th at conferences like the FMC will continue to be a vital part of the 
process, providing the ideas, analysis , and debate that will help us make the best possible 
judgments.  Thank you for listening  and for this opportunity  to be a part of this important 
conference.

The Goals of Monetary Policy and How We Pursue Them
 
   
Remarks by

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  
 
at 
 
The Commonwealth Club  
 
San Francisco, California  
 
 
 
 
 
  
January  18, 2017  
  
Good afternoon.  It  is a pleasure to join all of you at t he Commonwealth Club 
today, not the least because the c lub and the Federal Reserve have a few things in 
common.  Both organizations, as it happens, have a board of governors and a chair.  And 
both the c lub’s and the Fed’s histories extend back more than a century.  The c lub, as 
many here know, was founded in 1903, and the Federal Reserve a decade later.  Perhaps because of our shared origins in the Progressive Era, a period of reform in American life, we hold certain values in common.  According to your website, the c lub is nonpartisan 
and dedicated to the impa rtial discussion of issues important to your community and the 
nation.  At the Fed, we too are nonpartisan and focused squarely on the public interest.  We strive to conduct our deliberations impartially and base our decisions on factual evidence and objec tive analysis.  This afternoon I will discuss some challenges we’ve 
faced in our recent deliberations and may face in the next few years.   
Perhaps, though, it is best to start by stepping back and asking , what is --and, 
importantly, what isn’t --our job a s the nation’s central bank?  And how do we go about 
trying to accomplish it?  The Federal Reserve has an array of responsibilities.  I’ll mention our principal duties and then focus on one --monetary policy, the responsibility 
that gets the most public attention. 
In addition to monetary policy, we --in collaboration with other regulatory 
agencies  at both the federal and state levels --oversee banks and some other financial 
institutions to ensure they operate safely and soundly and treat their customers fair ly.  We 
monitor the financial system as a whole and promote its stability to  help  avoid financial 
crises that could choke off credit to consumers and businesses.  We also reliably and safely process trillions of dollars of payments for the nation’s banks a nd the federal  - 2 - 
government and ensure that banks have an ample supply of currency and coin to meet the 
demands of their depositors.  And we work with communities, nonprofit organizations, lenders, educators, and others to encourage financial and economic li teracy, promote 
equal access to credit, and advance economic and community development.  
But, as I noted, monetary policy draws the most headlines.  What is monetary 
policy, exactly?  Simply put, it consists of central bank actions aimed at influencing interest rates and financial conditions more generally.  Its purpose is to help foster a 
healthy economy.  But monetary policy cannot, by itself, create a healthy economy.  It cannot, for instance , educate young people, generate technological breakthroughs, ma ke 
workers and businesses more productive, or address the root causes of inequality.  Fundamentally, the energy, ingenuity, and know -how of American workers and 
entrepreneurs, along with our natural resources, create prosperity.  Regulatory policy and fiscal policy --the decisions by the Administration and the Congress about how much and 
how the government spends, taxes , and borrows --can influence these more fundamental 
economic pillars.  
I’ve said what monetary policy can not do.  But what can it do?  It can lean against 
damaging fluctuations in the economy.  Nearly 40 years ago, the Congress set two main guideposts for that task-- maximum employment and price stability.  We refer to these 
assigned goals as our dual mandate.  When the economy is weak and unempl oyment is on 
the rise, we encourage spending and investing by pushing short -term interest rates lower.  
As you may know, t he interest rate that we target is the federal funds rate, the rate banks 
charge each other for overnight loans.  Lowering short -term rates in turn puts downward 
pressure on longer -term interest rates, making credit more affordable --for families, for  - 3 - 
instance, to buy a house or for businesses to expand.  Similarly, when the economy is 
threatening to push inflation too high down the road, we increase interest rates to keep the economy on a sustainable path and lean against its tendency to boom and then bust. 
But what exactly do the terms “ maximum employment”  and “ price stability ” 
mean?  Does maximum employment mean that every single person  who wants a job has a 
job?  No.   There are always a certain number of people who are temporarily between jobs  
after having recently lost a job or having left one voluntarily to pursue better 
opportunities.  Others may have just graduated and have started looking for a job or have decided to return to working --for instance , when their child starts school.  This so- called 
frictional unemployment is evident even in the healthiest of economies. 
Then there is structural unemployment-- a difficult problem both fo r the people 
affected and for policymakers trying to address it.  Sometimes people are ready and willing to work, but their skills, perhaps because of technological advances, are not a 
good fit for the jobs that are available.  Or suitable jobs may be avai lable but are not close 
to where they and their families live.  These are factors over which monetary policy has little influence.   Other measures --such as job training and other workforce development 
programs --are better suited to address structural unemp loyment.   
After t aking account of both frictional and structural unemployment, what 
unemployment rate is roughly equivalent to the maximum level of employment that can be sustained in the longer run?  The rate can change over time as the economy evolves, but, for now, many economists, including my colleagues at the Fed and me , judge that it 
is around 4- 3/4 percent.  It’s important to try to estimate the unemployment rate that is  - 4 - 
equivalent to maximum employment because persistently operating below it pushe s 
inflation higher, which brings me to our price stability mandate.  
Does price stability mean having no inflation whatsoever?  Again, the answer is 
no.  By “ price stability ,” we mean a level of inflation that is low and stable enough that it 
doesn’t need to figure prominently into people’s and businesses’ economic decisions.  
Based on research and decades of experience, we define that level as 2 percent a year --an 
inflation objective similar to that adopted by most other major central banks.1  Individual 
prices, of course, move up and down by more than 2 percent all the time.  Such movements are essential to a well- functioning economy.  They  allow supply and demand 
to adjust for various goods and services.
  By “inflation,”  we mean price changes as a 
whole for all of the various goods and services that households consume.   
No one likes high inflation, and it  is easy to understand why.  Although wages 
and prices tend to move in t andem over long periods, inflation erodes household 
purchasing power if it is not matched with similar increases in wages, and it eats away the value of households’ savings.  So, then, why don’t we and other central banks aim for zero inflation?  There are  several technical reasons, but a more fundamental reason is to 
create a buffer against the opposite of inflation--that is, deflation.  Deflation is a general and persistent decline in the level of prices, a phenomenon Americans last experienced 
during the  Great Depression of the 1930s and one that Japan has confronted for most of 
the past two decades.  Deflation can feed on itself, leading to economic stagnation or worse.  It puts pressure on employers to either cut wages or cut jobs.  And it can be very 
hard on borrowers, who find themselves repaying their loans with dollars that are worth 
                                                 
1 Our objective is 2 percent inflation as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal con -
sumption expenditures  published by the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis.   - 5 - 
more than the dollars they originally borrowed.  I am sure we all remember learning in 
school about farm families in the Great Depression who couldn’t pay their mortgage s and 
lost their homes and their livelihoods when crop prices fell persistently.  
Another important reason to maintain a modest inflation buffer is that too  low 
inflation impairs the ability of monetary policy to counter economic downturns.  When inflation is very low, interest rates tend to be very low also, even in good times.  And when interest rates are generally very low, the Fed has only limited room to cut them  to 
help the economy in bad times. 
In a nutshell , the Fed’s goal is to promote financial conditions conducive to 
maximum employment and price stability.  And I  have offered broad -brush definitions of 
each of those objectives.  So w here is the economy now, in relationship to them?  The 
short answer is , we think it’s close.  The economy has come a long way since the 
financial crisis.  As you know, the crisis marked the start of a very deep recession.  It 
destroyed nearly 9 million jobs, and it’s been a long, slow slog to recover from it.  Unemployment peaked at 10 percent late in 2009, a level unsee n for more than 25 years, 
and didn’t move below 8  percent for nearly three years.  Falling home prices put millions 
of homeowners “underwater ,” meaning they owed more on their mortgages than their 
homes were worth.  And the stock market plunged, slashing t he value of 401(k) 
retirement nest eggs.  
The extraordinarily severe recession required an extraordinary response from 
monetary policy, both to support the job market and prevent deflation.  We cut our short -
term interest rate target to near zero at the end  of 2008 and kept it there for seven years.  
To provide further support to American households and businesses, we pressed down on  - 6 - 
longer -term interest rates by purchasing large amounts of longer -term Treasury securities 
and government -guaranteed mortgage s ecurities.  And we communicated our intent to 
keep short -term interest rates low for a long time, thus increasing the downward pressure 
on longer -term interest rates, which are influenced by expectations about short -term rates.  
Now, it’s fair to say, the economy is near maximum employment and inflation is 
moving toward our goal.  The unemployment rate is less than 5 percent, roughly back to 
where it was before the recession.  And, over the past seven years, the economy has added about 15- 1/2 million net ne w jobs.  Although inflation has been running below our 
2 percent objective for quite some time, we have seen it start inching back toward 2 percent last year as the job market continued to improve and as the effects of a big drop 
in oil prices faded.  Last  month, at our most recent meeting, we took account of the 
considerable progress the economy has made by modestly increasing our short -term 
interest rate target by 1/4  percentage point to a range of 1/2 to 3/4 percent.  It was the 
second such step-- the fir st came a year earlier --and reflects our confidence the economy 
will continue to improve. 
Now, m any of you would love to know exactly when the next rate increase is 
coming and how high rates will rise.  The simple truth is,  I can’t tell you because it will 
depend on how the economy actually evolves over coming months .  The economy is vast 
and vastly complex, and its path can take surprising twists and turns.  What I can tell you 
is what we expect --along with a very large caveat that our interest rate expectations will 
change as our outlook for  the economy changes .  That said, as of last month, I and most 
of my colleagues --the other members of the Fed Board in Washington and the presidents 
of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks --were expecting to incr ease our federal funds  - 7 - 
rate target a few times a year until, by the end of 2019, it is close to our estimate of its 
longer -run neutral rate of 3 percent.  
The term “ neutral rate”  requires some explaining.  It  is the rate that , once the 
economy has reached o ur objectives , will keep the economy on an even keel.  It is neither 
pressing on the gas pedal to make the car go faster nor easing off so much that the car slows down.  Right now our foot is still pressing on the gas pedal, though, as I noted, we 
have eas ed back a bit.  Our foot remains on the pedal in part because we want to make 
sure the economic expansion remains strong enough to withstand an unexpected shock, given that we don’t have much room to cut interest rates.  In addition, inflation is still running below our 2 percent objective , and, by some measures, there may still be some 
room for progress in the job market.  For instance, wage growth has only recently begun to pick up and remains fairly low.  A broader measure of unemployment isn’t quite bac k 
to its pre -recession level.  It includes people who would like a job but have been too 
discouraged to look for one and people who are working part  time but would rather work 
full time.  
Nevertheless, as the economy approaches our objectives, it makes sens e to 
gradually reduce the level of monetary policy support.  Changes in monetary policy take time to work their way into the economy.  Waiting too long to begin moving toward the neutral rate could risk a nasty surprise down the road--either too much infla tion, financial 
instability, or both.  In that scenario, we could be forced to raise interest rates rapidly, which in turn could push the economy into a new recession.  
The factors I  have just discussed are the usual sort that central bank ers consider as 
economies move through a recovery.  But a longer -term trend --slow productivity  - 8 - 
growth --helps explain why we don’t think dramatic interest rate increases are required to 
move our federal funds rate target back to neutral.  Labor productivity --that is , the out put 
of goods and services per hour of work-- has increased by only about 1/2 percent a year, 
on average, over the past six years or so and only 1 -1/4 percent a year over the past 
decade.  That contrasts with the previous 30 years when productivity grew a bi t more 
than 2 percent a year.  This productivity slowdown matters enormously because 
Americans’ standard of living depends on productivity growth.  With productivity growth of 2 percent a year, the average standard of living will double roughly every 35 ye ars.  
That means our children can reasonably hope to be better off economically than we are now.  But productivity growth of 1 percent a year means the average standard of living will double only every 70 years.  
Economists do not fully understand the caus es of the productivity slowdown.  
Some emphasize that technological progress and its diffusion throughout the economy 
seem to be slower over the past decade or so.  Others look at college graduation rates, which have flattened out after rising rapidly in previous generations.  And still others focus on a dramatic slowing in the creation of new businesses, which are often more innovative than established firms.  While each of these factors has likely played a role in slowing productivity growth, the extent t o which they will continue to do so is an open 
question.
2 
Why does slow productivity growth, if it persists, imply a lower neutral interest 
rate?  First, it implies that the economy’s usual rate of output growth, when employment 
                                                 
2 Other factors depressing the neutral rate include housing construction and lackluster exports.  Housing 
still hasn’t fully recovered from the financial crisis, in part because mortgage- qualification standards 
remain tight.  Weak growth abroad in Europe, China, and elsewhere, some of which is related to their own 
productivity challenges, has hurt sales of U.S. goods.   - 9 - 
is at its maximum and price s are stable, will be significantly slower than the post -World 
War II average.  Slower economic growth, in turn, implies businesses will see less need 
to invest in expansion.  And it implies families and individuals will feel the need  to save 
more and spend less.  Because interest rates are the mechanism that brings the supply of 
savings and the demand for investment funds into balance, more saving and less investment imply a lower neutral interest rate.  Although w e can’t directly measure the 
neutral interest rate , it is something that can be estimated in retrospect.  And , as we have 
increasingly realized, it has probably been trending down for a while now.  Our current 3 percent estimate of the longer -run neutral rate, for instance, i s a full percentage point 
lower than our estimate just three years ago.  
You might be thinking , what does this discussion of rather esoteric concepts such 
as the neutral rate mean to me?  If you are a borrower, it means that, although the interest rates you  pay on, say, your auto loan or mortgage or credit card likely will creep higher, 
they probably will not increase dramatically.  Likewise, if you are a saver, the rates you earn could inch higher after a while , but probably not by a lot.  For some years, I ’ve 
heard from savers who want higher rates , and now I’m beginning to hear from borrowers 
who want lower rates.  I can’t emphasize strongly enough, though, that we are not trying to help one  of those groups  at the expense of  the other .  We ’re focused very much on that 
dual mandate I keep mentioning.  At the end of the day, we all benefit from plentiful jobs and stable prices, whether we are savers or borrowers --and many of us, of course, are 
both. 
Economics and monetary policy are, at best, inexact sciences .  Figuring out what 
the neutral interest rate is and setting the right path toward it is not like setting the  - 10 - 
thermostat in a house :  You can’t just set the temperature at 68 degrees and walk away.  
And, because changes in monetary policy affect the econo my with long lags  sometimes , 
we must base our decisions on our best forecasts of an uncertain future.  Thus, we must 
continually reassess and adjust our policies based on what we learn.  
That point leads me to repeat what  I said when I began:  Like t he Comm onwealth 
Club, the Federal Reserve was created more than a century ago during an era of government reform to serve the public interest.  The structure established for the Federal Reserve back then intentionally insulates us from short -term political pressu res so we can 
focus on what’s best for the American economy in the longer run.  I promise you, with the sometimes imperfect information and evidence we have available, we will do just that by making the best decisions we can, as objectively as we can.  
Than k you.  I welcome your questions. ",2017-01-18,yellen

April  16, 2014  
Nearly five years into the expansion that began after the financial crisis and the 
Great Recession, the recovery has come a long way.  More than 8 million jobs have been 
added to nonfarm payrolls since 2009, almost the same number l ost as a result of the 
recession .  Led by a resurgent auto industry, manufacturing output has also nearly 
returned to its pre -recession peak.   While the housing market still has far to go, it seems 
to have turned a corner.   
It is a sign of how far the eco nomy has come that a return to full employment is, 
for the first time since the crisis, in the medium -term outlooks  of many forecasters.  It is a 
reminder of how far we have to go, however, that this long -awaited outcome is projected 
to be more than two ye ars away.   
Today I will discuss how my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee 
(FOMC) and I view the state of the economy and how this view is likely to shape our 
efforts to  promote a return to maximum employment in a context of price stability .  I will 
start with the FOMC’s outlook, which foresees a gradual return over the next two  to three 
years of economic conditions consistent with its mandate .  
While monetary policy discussions naturally begin with a baseline outlook, the 
path of the economy is  uncertain , and effective policy must respond to significant 
unexpected  twists and turns the economy may take .  My primary focus today will be on 
how the FOMC’s  monetary  policy framework has evolved to best support the recovery 
through those twists and tur ns, and what this framework is likely to imply as the recovery 
progresses.   - 2 - 
The Current Economic Outlook  
The FOMC’s current outlook for continued, moderate growth is little changed 
from last fall.  In recent months, some indicators have been notably weak, requiring us to 
judge whether the data are signaling a material change in the outlook.  The unusually harsh winter weather in much of the nation has complicated this judgment, but my FOMC colleag ues and I generally believe that a significant part of the recent soft ness was  
weather  related.  
The continued improvement in l abor market conditions  has been important in this 
judgment .  The unemployment rate, at 6.7 percent, has fallen  three -tenths  of 1 percentage 
point since late last year .  Broader measures of unemployment that  include  workers  
marginally attached  to the labor force and those working part  time for economic reasons 
have fallen a bit more than the headline unemployment rate, and labor forc e participation , 
which had been falling, has ticked up this year.   
Inflation , as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures , 
has slowed from an annual rate of about 2- 1/2 percent  in early  2012 to  less than 1  percent 
in February of t his year.
1  This rate is well below the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run 
objective.   Many advanced economies are observing a similar softness in inflation.  
To some extent,  the low rate of  inflation  seems due to influences t hat are likely to 
be temporary, including a deceleration in consumer energy prices  and outright declines in 
core import prices in recent quarters .  Longer -run inflation expectations have remained 
remarkably steady, however.  W e anticipate  that, as the effects of transitory factors 
subside and as labor market gains continue , inflation will gradually move back toward 
2 percent.  
                                                 
1 These inflation rates  are based on 12- month changes.   - 3 - 
In sum, the central tendency of FOMC participant projections for the 
unemployment rate at the end of 2016 is 5.2 to 5.6 percent, and for inflation the central 
tendency is 1.7 to 2 percent. 2  If this forecast was to become reality, the economy would 
be approaching what my colleagues and I view as maximum employment and price stability  for the first time in nearly a decade .  I find this baseline outlook quite plausible.  
Of course, i f the economy obediently followed our forecasts, the job of central 
bankers would be a lot easier and their speeches would be a lot shorter.  Alas, the economy is often not so compliant, so  I will ask your indulgence for a few more minutes.  
Three Big Questions for the FOMC  
Because the course of the economy is uncertain, monetary policy makers need to 
carefully watch for signs that it is diverging from the baseline  outlook and then respond 
in a syst ematic way .  Let me turn first to monitoring and discuss three questions I believe 
are likely to loom large in the FOMC’s ongoing assessment of where we are on the path back to maximum employment and price stability . 
Is there still significant slack in the  labor market? 
The first question concerns the extent of slack in the labor market.  One of the 
FOMC’s objectives is to promote a return to maximum employment, but exactly what conditions are consistent with maximum employment can be difficult to assess.  Thus far in the recovery and to this day, there is  little question that the economy has remained far 
from maximum employment, so measurement difficulties were not  our focus .  But as the 
attainment of our maximum employment goal draws nearer, it will be nec essary for the 
                                                 
2 These figures  are based on the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) submitted in conjunction with 
the March 2014 FOMC meeting.  The SEP is an addendum to the FOMC minutes and is available at Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2014), “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, 
March 18 -19, 2014,” press release, April 9, 
www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monet ary/20140409a.htm.   - 4 - 
FOMC to form  a more nuanced  judgment about when the recovery of the labor market 
will be materially complete.  As the FOMC’s statement on longer -term goals and policy 
strategy emphasizes, these judgments are inherently uncertain and must be based on a 
wide range of indicators.3   
I will refer to the shortfall in employment relative to its mandate -consistent level 
as labor market slack , and there are a number of different indicators of this slack.  
Probably the best single indicator is the unemployment rate.  At 6.7 percent, it is now 
slightly more than 1 percentage point above the 5.2 to 5.6 percent central tendency of the 
Committee ’s projections for  the longer -run normal unemployment rate.  This sh ortfall 
remains significant , and in our baseline outlook, it  will take more than two  years to 
close.4   
Other data suggest that there may be more  slack in labor markets than indicated 
by the unemployment rate .  For example, the share of the workforce that is working part  
time but would prefer to work full  time remains quite high by historical standards .  
Similarly, while the share of workers in the labor force who are unemployed and have 
been looking for work for more than six  months has fallen from its peak in 2010, it  
remains as high as any time  prior to the Great Recession.5  There is ongoing debate about 
why long -term unemployment remains so high and the degree to which it might decline

January 28, 2014, which is available on the Board’s website at

4 See the SEP in Board of Governors, “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, March 18 -19, 
2014,” in note 2 . 
5 The share  in CPS employment of persons working part  time for economic reasons rose from 3 percent 
prior to the recession to 6.5 percent in November 2009, and it has since then declined only to 5 
percent.   The share in the labor force of those unemployed for more than 26 weeks rose from less than 1 
percent prior to the recession to 4.5 percent, and it has since declined to just below 2.5 percent; the previous 
peak for this series was 2.5 percent in 1983.  The records for long- term unemployed begin in 1948 .  - 5 - 
in a more robust economy.  As I argue d more fully in a recent speech, I  believe that long-
term unemployment might  fall appreciably if economic conditions were stronger.6  
The low level of l abor force participation may also signal additional slack  that is 
not reflected in the headline unemploy ment rate.  Participation would be expected to fall  
because of  the aging of the population, but the decline steepened in the recovery.  
Although economists differ over what share of those currently outside the labor market 
might join or rejoin the labor force in a stronger economy , my own view is that some 
portion of the decline in participation likely represents labor market slack.7   
Lastly, economists also look to wage pressures to signal a tightening labor market.  
At present, w age gains continue to proceed at a historically slow pace in this recovery , 
with few signs of a broad -based acceleration.   As the extent of slack we see today 
diminishes, however, the FOMC will need to monitor these and other labor market 
indicators closely to judge how much slack remains and, therefore, how accommodative 
monetary policy should be. 
Is inflation moving back t oward 2 percent?  
A second question that is likely to figure heavily in our assessment of the 
recovery is whether inflation is moving back toward the FOMC’s 2 pe rcent longer -run 
objective , as envisioned in our baseline outlook.  As the most recent FOMC statement

speech delivered at the 2014 National In teragency Community Reinvestment Conference, Chicago, March 
31, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20140331a.htm.  
7 For the view that most of the recent decline in labor force participation reflects retirement, see Shigeru 
Fujita (2014), “On the Causes of Declines in the Labor Force Participation Rate,” Federal Reserve Bank of 
Philadelphia, special report, Research Rap,  February 6, available at www.philadelphiafed.org/research -and-
data/publications/research -rap.  The view that a larger share of the recent decline reflects cyclical factors is 
expressed by Christopher J. Erceg and Andrew T. Levin (2013), “Labor Force Parti cipation and Monetary 
Policy in the Wake of the Great Recession,” paper presented at “Fulfilling the Full Employment Mandate --
Monetary Policy and the Labor Market,” 57th Economic Conference of the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Boston, April 12, available at www. bostonfed.org/employment2013/agenda.htm.   - 6 - 
emphasizes, inflation persistently below 2 percent could pose risks to economic 
performance.  
The FOMC strives to avoid inflation slipping too far below i ts 2 percent objective 
because, at very low inflation rates , adverse economic developments could more easily 
push the  economy into deflation.  The limited historical experience with deflation shows 
that, once it starts, deflation can become entrenched and associated with prolonged periods of very weak economic performance.
8 
A persistent bout of very low inflation carries other risks as well.  With the federal 
funds rate currently near its lower limit, lower inflation translates into a higher real value for th e federal funds rate, limiting the capacity of monetary policy to support the 
economy.
9  Further, with longer -term inflation expectations anchored near 2 percent in 
recent years, persistent inflation well below this expected value increases the real burd en 
of debt for  households and firms , which may put a drag on economic activity.    
I will mention two  considerations that will be important in assessing whether 
inflation is likely to move back to 2 percent  as the economy recovers.  First, we anticipate 
that, as labor market slack diminishes, it will exert less of a drag on inflation.  However, 
during the recovery, very high levels of slack have seemingly not generated strong downward pressure on inflation.  We must therefore watch carefully to see whether 
                                                 
8 See Ben S. Bernanke (2002), “Deflation:  Making Sure ‘It’ Doesn’t Happen Here,” speech delivered at the 
National Economists Club, Washington, November 21, 
www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2002/20021121/de fault.htm.  
9 If firms’ and households’ spending decisions depended only on longer -term interest rates, temporarily 
higher short -term real interest rates due to low inflation at a time that nominal interest rates are constrained 
by the zero lower bound woul d have little economic effects, provided that these higher short -term real 
interest rates would be expected to be compensated by lower short -term real interest rates later on.  
However, to the extent that these spending decisions depend in part on shorter -term real interest rates, low 
inflation can induce meaningful economic costs.   - 7 - 
diminishing slack is helping return inflation to our objective.10  Second, our baseline 
projection rests on the view that  inflation expectations will remain  well  anchored near 2 
percent and provide a natural pull back to that level.  But the strength of that  pull in the 
unprecedented conditions we continue to face is something we must continue to assess.  
Finally, the FOMC is well aware that inflation could also threaten to rise 
substantially above  2 percent.  At present, I rate the chances of this happening a s 
significantly below the chances of inflation persisting below 2 percent, but we must 
always be prepared to respond to such unexpected outcomes , which leads us to my third 
question. 
What factors may push the recovery off track ? 
Myriad factors continuously  buffet the economy, so the Committee must always 
be asking, “What factors may be pushing the recovery off track?”  For example, over the 
nearly 5 years of the recovery, the economy has been affected by greater -than-expected 
fiscal drag in the United State s and by spillovers from the sovereign debt and banking 
problems of some euro -area countries.  Further, our baseline outlook has changed as we 
have learned about the degree of structural damage to the economy wrought by the crisis and the subsequent pace of healing.    
Let me offer an example of how these issues shape policy.  Four years ago, in 
April 2010, the outlook appeared fairly bright.  T he emergency lending programs that the 
                                                 
10 The uncertainty surrounding the empirical relationship between slack and inflation is discussed in 
James  H. Stock and Mark W. Watson (2009), “Phillips Curve Inflation Forecast s,” in Jeff Fuhrer, 
Yolanda  K. Kodrzycki, Jane Sneddon Little, and Giovanni P. Olivei, eds., Understanding Inflation and the 
Implications for Monetary Policy:  A Phillips Curve Retrospective  (Cambridge, Mass.:  MIT Press).  
Moreover, with the share of long -term unemployed in total unemployment unusually elevated in recent 
years, there is an ongoing discussion about whether short - and long -term unemployment have differential 
effects on inflati on.  See Robert J. Gordon (2013), “The Phillips Curve Is Alive and Well:  Inflation and the 
NAIRU during the Slow Recovery,” NBER Working Paper Series 19390 (Cambridge, Mass.:  National 
Bureau of Economic Research, August), available at www.nber.org/papers /w19390; and Mark W. Watson

Federal Reserve implemented at the height of the crisis had been largely wou nd down, 
and the Fed was soon to complete its first large -scale asset purchase program. Private -
sector forecasters polled in the April 2010 Blue  Chip survey were predicting that the 
unemployment rate would fall steadily to 8.6 percent in  the final quarter of 2011.11   
This forecast proved quite accurate --the unemployment rate averaged 8. 6 percent 
in the fourth quarter of 2011.  But this was  not the whole story.  In April 2010, Blue  Chip 
forecasters not only expected falling unemployment , they also expected the FOMC to 
soon begin raising the federal funds rate.  Indeed, they expected the federal funds rate to  
reach 1. 3 percent by the second quarter of 2011.12  By July  2010, however, with growth 
disappointing  and the FOMC expressing concerns a bout softening in both growth and 
inflation,  the Blue  Chip forecast of the federal funds rate in mid -2011 had fallen to 
0.8 percent, and by October the forecasters expected that the rate would remain in the 
range of 0 to 25 basis point s throughout 2011, as  turned out to be the case.13  Not only 
did expectations of policy tightening recede, the FOMC also initiated a new $600 billion asset purchase program in November 2010.  
                                                 
11 See Aspen Publishers (2010), Blue Chip Economic Indicators,  vol. 35, no. 4 (April 10).  These forecasts 
were similar to the central tendency of FOMC participants’ projections for the unemployment rate at the 
end of 2011 submitted in conjunction with the April 2010 FOMC meeting, which ranged from 8.1 to 
8.5 percent.  See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2010), “ Minutes of the Federal Open 
Market Committee, April 27 -28, 2010,” press release, May 19, 
www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20100519a.htm.

Aspen Publishers (2010), vol. 29, no. 10 (October 1).  In the statement following its August 10, 2010, 
meeting, the FOMC noted that “the pace of recovery in output and employment has slowed in recent 
months.”  See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2010), “FOMC Statement,” press release, August 10, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20100810a.htm.  See also the

Thus, while the reductions in the unemployment rate through 2011 were roughly 
as forecast in early 2010, this improvement only came  about  with the FOMC providing a 
considerably higher level of accommodation than originally anticipated.   
This experience was essentially repeated the following  year.  In April 2011, Blue  
Chip forecasters expect ed the unemployment rate to fall to 7.9 percent  by the fourth 
quarter of 2012, with the  FOMC expected to have already raised t he federal funds rate to 
near 1  percent by mid -2012.14   
As it turned out, the unemployment rate forecast was once more remarkably 
accurate, but again this was associated with considerably more accommodation than 
anticipated.  In response  to signs of slowing economic activity , in August 2011 the 
FOMC  for the first time expressed its forward guidance in terms of the calendar, stating 
that conditions would likely warrant exceptionally low levels for  the federal funds rate at 
least through mid -2013. The following month, the Committee  added to accommodation 
by adopting a new balance sheet policy known as the m aturity extension program. 15  
Thus, i n both 2011 and 2012, the unemployment rate actually declined by about 
as much as had been forecast the previous year, but only after unexpected weakness 
prompted additional accommodative steps by the Federal Reserve.  In both cases, I 
believe that the FOMC’s decision to respond to signs of weakness with significant additional accommodation played an important role in helping to keep the  projected labor

market recovery on track .16  These episodes illustrate what I described earlier as a vital 
aspect o f effective monetary policymaking:  monitor the economy for signs that events 
are unfolding in a materially different manner than expected and adjust policy  in response 
in a systematic manner.   Now I will turn from the task of monitoring to the policy 
response.  
Policy Challenges in an Unprecedented Recovery  
Fundamental to modern thinking on central banking is the idea that monetary 
policy is more effective when the public better understands and anticipates how the 
central bank will respond to evolving economic conditions.   Specifically, it is important 
for the central bank to make clear how it will adjust its policy stance in response to  
unforeseen economic developments  in a manner that reduce s or blunts potentially 
harmful consequences.   If the public  understands and expects policymakers  to behave in 
this systematically stabilizing manner, it will tend to respond less to such developments .  
Monetary policy will thus have an “ automatic stabilizer ” effect  that operates  through 
private -sector  expectations .  It is important to note that tying the response of policy to the 
economy necessarily makes the future course of the federal funds rate uncertain.  But by responding to changing circumstances, policy can be most effective at reducing  
uncertainty about the course of inflation and employment.  
Recall how this worked d uring the couple of decades before the crisis --a period 
sometimes known as the Great Moderation .  The FOMC’s main policy tool, the federal 
funds rate, was well above zero, leaving ample scope to  respond to the modest  shocks 
                                                 
16 There are a range of estimates on the effectiveness of these policies.  A review is provided in Ben S. 
Bernanke (2012), “Monetary Policy since the Onset of the Crisis,” speech delivered at “The Changing 
Policy Landscape,” a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson 
Hole, Wyo., August 30- September  1, 
www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20120831a.htm .  - 11 - 
that buffeted the economy during that period.  Many studies confirmed that the 
appropriate response of policy  to those shocks could be described with a fair degree of 
accuracy by a simple  rule linking the federal funds rate to the shortfall or excess of  
employment and inflation relative to their desired values.17  The famous Taylor rule  
provides one such formula .18   
The idea that monetary policy should react in a systematic manner in order to 
blunt the effects of shocks has remained central in the FOMC’s policymaking during this recovery.  However, the application of this idea has been more challenging.  With the federal funds rate pinned near  zero, the FOMC has been forced to rely on two less 
familiar policy tools --the first  one being forward guidance regarding the future setting of 
the federal funds rate and  the second being large -scale asset purchases.  T here are no  
time-tested  guidelines for how these tools should be adjusted i n response to changes in 
the outlook.  As the episodes recounted earlier illustrate, the FOMC has continued to try to adjust its policy tools in a systematic manner in response to new information about the economy.  But because both the tools and the economic conditions have been unfamiliar, it has al so been critical that the FOMC communicate how it expects  to deploy its  tools in 
response to material changes in the outlook.   
Let me review some important elements in the evolution of the FOMC’s 
communication framework .  When the  FOMC  initially  began usi ng its unconventional  
tools, policy communication was relatively  simple.  In December 2008, for example, the

Monetary Policy,” chap. 15 in Benjamin M. Friedma n and Michael Woodford, eds., Handbook of Monetary 
Economics , vol. 3 B (San Diego:  North -Holland), pp. 829- 59.  (An April 2010 working paper version of

FOMC said it expected that conditions would warrant keeping the federal funds rate near 
zero for “some time .”  This period before the “liftoff”  in the federal funds rate was 
described in increasingly specific, and  (as it turned out) longer, periods over  time --“some 
time” becam e “an extended period,” which was later changed to “mid -2013, ” then “late 
2014,” then “mid- 2015.”19  This fixed, calendar -based  guidance had the virtue of 
simplicity , but it lacked the automatic stabilizer  property of communication that would 
signal how and why the stance of policy and forward guidance might change  as 
developments unfolded, and as we learned about the extent of the need for accommodation .   
More recently, the Federal Reserve, and I might add, other central banks around 
the world, have sought to incorporate this automatic stabilizer  feature in their 
communications.
20  In December 2012, the Committee reformulated its forward 
guidance, stating that it anticipated that the federal funds rate would remain near zero at least as long as the unemployment rate remained above 6 -1/2 percent, inflation over the 
period between one and two years ahead was projected to be no more than half a 
                                                 
19 The references to “some time,” “an ex tended period,” “mid -2013,” “late 2014,” and “mid- 2015” 
appeared in the FOMC statements of, respectively, December 2008, March 2009, August 2011, January 
2012, and September 2012.  See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2008), “FOMC

qualitative forward guidance in February 2014; see Bank of England, “Forward Guidance,” webpage, 
www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/Pages/forwardguidance.aspx.  The European Central Bank 
recently linked its forward guidance more explicitly to its assessment of economic slack, as discussed in President Mario Draghi’s press conference on March 6, 2014; see Mario Draghi (2014), “Introductory 
Statement to the Press Conference (with Q&A),” European Central Bank, Frankfurt, March 6,

percentage point above the Committee’s objective, and longer -term inflation expectations 
continued to be well anchored.  This guidance emphasized to the public that it could 
count on a near -zero federal funds rate at least until substantial progress in the recovery 
had been achieved, however long that might take.  When these thresholds were announced, the unemployment rate was reported to be 7.7 percent , and the Committee 
projected that the 6 -1/2 percent threshold would not be reached for another 2- 1/2 years --
in mid -2015.  The C ommittee emphasized that these numerical criteria  were not triggers  
for raising the federal funds rate,  and Chairman Bernanke stated that , ultimately , any 
decision to begin removing accommodation would be based on a wide range of indicators.
21   
Our communications about asset purchases have undergone a similar 
transformation. The initial asset purchase programs had fixed time and quantity limits, although thos e limits came with a proviso that the y might be adjusted.  In the fall of 
2012, the FOMC launched its current purchase program, this time explicitly t ying the 
course of the program to evolving economic conditions.  When the program began, the rate of purchases was $85 billion per month, and the Committee indicated that purchases would continue, providing that inflation remained well behaved, until there was a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.
22 
Based on the cumulative progress towa rd maximum employment since the 
initiation of the program and the improvement in the outlook for the labor market , the 
FOMC began reducing the pace of asset purchases last December, stat ing that “[ i]f

incoming information broadly supports the Committee’s expectation of ongoing 
improvement in labor market  conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer -
term objective , the Committee  will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further 
measured steps at future meetings .”23  Purchases are currently proceeding at a pace of 
$55 billion per month.  Consistent with my theme today, however, the FOMC state ment 
underscores that purchases are not on a preset course--the FOMC stands ready to adjust 
the pace of purchases as warranted should the outlook change materially .   
Recent Changes to the Forward Guidance  
At our most recent meeting in March, the FOMC reformulated its forward 
guidance for the federal funds rate.  While one of the  main motivation s for this change 
was that the unemployment rate might soon cr oss the 6- 1/2 percent threshold, the new 
formulation  is also well  suited to help the FOMC explain policy adjustments that may 
arise in response to changes in the outlook.  I should note that the change in the forward 
guidance did not indicate a change in t he Committee’s policy intentions, but instead was 
made to clarify the Committee’s thinking about policy as the economy continues to 
recover.  The new guidance provides a general description of the framework that the FOMC will apply in making decisions about the timing of liftoff .  Specifically, in 
determining how long to maintain the current target range of 0 to 25 basis point s for the 
federal funds rate, “ the Committee will assess progress, both realized and expected, 
toward its objectives of maximum emplo yment and 2 percent inflation.”
24  In other 
words , the larger the shortfall of employment or inflation from the ir respective objectives, 
                                                 
23 See Bo ard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2013), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC 
Statement,” press release, December 18, 
www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20131218a.htm . 
24 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2014), “Fede ral Reserve Issues FOMC 
Statement,” press release, March 19, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20140319a.htm .  - 15 - 
and the slower the projected progress toward those objectives , the longer the current 
target range for the federal funds rate is likely to be maintained.  This approach 
underscores the continuing commitment of the FOMC to maintain the appropriate degree of accommodation to support the  recovery.  The new guidance also reaffirms the 
FOMC’s view that decisions about liftoff should not be based on any one  indicator, but 
that it will take into account a wide  range of information on the labor market, inflation, 
and financial developments.  
Along with this general framework, the FOMC provided a n assessment of what 
that framework implies for the likely path of policy under the baseline outlook.  At present, the Committee anticipates that economic and financial conditions will likely 
warrant maintaining the current range “for the federal funds rate for a consi derable time 
after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run goal, and provided that longer -term inflation 
expectations remain well anchored .”
25   
Finally, the Committee be gan explaining more fully how policy may operate in 
the period after liftoff, indicating its expectation that economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping short -term interest rates below levels the Committee views as 
likely to prove normal in th e longer run.  FOMC participants have cited different reasons 
for this view, but many of the reasons involve persistent effects of  the financial crisis and 
the possibility that the productive capacity of the economy will grow more slowly, at 
least for a ti me, than it did, on average, before the crisis.  The expectation that the 
achievement of our economic objectives will likely require low real interest rates for some time is again not confined to the United States but is shared broadly across many

advanced  economies.26  Of course, this guidance is a forecast and will evolve as we gain 
further evidence about how the economy is operating in the wake of the crisis and 
ensuing recession. 
Conclusion  
In summary, the policy framework I  have described reflects the F OMC’s 
commitment to systematically respond to unforeseen economic developments in order to 
promote a return to maximum employment in a context of price stability.    
 It is very welcome news t hat a return to these conditions has finally  appeared in 
the medium -term outlook of many forecasters.  But it will be much better news when this 
objective is reached.  My colleagues on the FOMC and I will stay  focused on doing the 
Federal Reserve’s part to promote this goal.

Good afternoon.  Thank you Dan, and thank you to everyone gathered here  and others 
throughout the System who are listening in.   
To members of Congress , Secretary Lew  and other s from the  administration and  fellow financial 
regulatory agencies  who are with us  today , welcome to the Federal Reserve.  Many f riends and 
family of mine are here, including my spouse , George, my brother , John, and my sister -in-law, 
Alison .  I am honored also to welcome back  former Chairm an Greenspan .  
I want to particularly thank President Obama for the honor of being asked to l ead the Federal 
Reserve and carry on its  important work.  When I accepted his offer, I promised the  president  I 
would do my very best , working with my Fed colleagues , to help restore the health of the 
economy and promote a strong and stable financial system.  
I am repeat ing this promise , in this distinguished company  and to all others listening because that 
is what this ceremony is about.  The oath I have affirmed, identical to the one taken  by everyone 
serving the Federal  Reserve, is a public promise to carry out my duties  guided by no interest 
other tha n the public’s interest.            
Today’s  event comes, as many of you know, a busy month after I began my duties as Chair.  In 
that short time, the Board has taken significant  steps to further strengthen financial regulation, 
and I have discharged one of my most important responsibilities, accounting for the Fed’s 
actions and explaining its policies in our semi -annual report to Congress.  I’ll do more of that  
explaining in two weeks, when I respond to questions from the media after the next meeting of 
the Federal Open Market Committee.    3 
Such communication is vital in a democracy  and especially important for the Fed eral Reserve, 
which relies on the confidence of the public to be effective in carrying out its  mission.   Chairman 
Bernanke initiated press conferences in 2011 as one of a number of steps to make the Federal 
Reserve more transparent and accountable, and I promise  to build on his legacy . 
Since 2010, whe n Chairman Bernanke stood where I stand today, we hav e made considerable 
progress.  The economy is stronger and the financial system is sounder.  We have come a long 
way, but we have farther to go.  More work lies ahead to complete implementation of Congre ss’ 
plan for strengthening financial regulation, the Dodd- Frank Act.  I promise to stay focused on 
moving that process forward as quickly and responsibly as possible and to verify that these 
reforms are meeting the goal of safeguarding the financial system.  
I will also continue the work of helping repair the damage done by the financial crisis  to the 
economy .  Too many Americans still can’t find a job or are forced to work part -time.  The goals 
set by Congress for the Federal Reserve are clear: maximu m employment and stable prices.  It is 
equally clear that the economy continues to operate  considerably short of these objectives .  I 
promise to do all that I  can, working with my fellow policymakers , to achieve the very important 
goals Congress has assign ed to the Federal Reserve.  
I take up these challenges aided by the immensely skilled, talented , and dedicated men and 
women who comprise the Federal Reserve's staff.   Our staff constitute one of the Fed's greatest 
strengths and I am proud to serve with in dividuals who exhibit the highest standards of 
professionalism and integrity .  They  work tirelessly, day in and day out, to serve the public 
interest.  Their skill, creativity and perseverance enabled the Fed to do its part to meet the grave 
threats our na tion faced in the financial crisis and then persevere in a disappointingly slow  4 
recovery.  And their knowledge, analysis and judgment will be indispensable in fulfilling the 
mission of the Federal Reserve in the years ahead.     
Congress has entrusted the Federal Reserve wit h great responsibilities .  The tools we deploy, to 
guide the f inancial system  and influence our vast economy, can seem far removed from the  lives 
and concerns of average Americans.  And yet the decisions we make affect the welfare and sh ape 
the future of every American.  I promise to never forget the individual lives , experiences and 
challenges  that lie behind the statistics we use to gauge the health of the economy.  The 
unemployment rate represents millions of individuals  who are eager to work but struggling to 
provide for themselves and their families.  When we make progress toward our goals, each  job 
that is created lifts this burd en for someone  who is better equipped to be a good parent, to build a 
stronger community, and to contribute to a more prosperous nation.   
Let me close by offering my hear tfelt thanks for  the many messages I have received since my 
nomination from individuals around the country who ha ve written to wish me well and offer 
their support .  I pledge to do m y very best to meet the challenges that lie ahead.     
Thank you all for coming today.     ",2014-03-05,yellen

and Monetary Policy

Thank you for the opportunity to speak here today.  I will begin by reviewing 
recent economic developments and then turn to supply -side considerations , such as the 
level of potential output and the potential growth of our economy.  I will conclude with a 
discussion of monetary policy.  As always, the views I express here today are mine alone.  
Recent Developments and the State of the Economy  
The U.S. economy has improved steadily since the recovery began seven years 
ago.  Our economy is now 10 percent larger than at its previous peak in 2007.  Employment has surpassed its 2008 peak by 5 million workers, and the unemployment rate has fallen from 10 percent to 5 percent, close to the level that many observers associate with full employment.   
Labor market developments remain healthy, with employers adding roughly 
200,000 jobs per month so far this year --a pace similar to that of the past several years  
(figure  1).  Job growth continues to be substantially faster than the underlying growth of 
the labor force, so the labor market continues to tighten.  Despite the strong job gains, the unemployment rate has flattened out at 5 percent over the past six months thanks to a welcome increase in the labor force participation rate.  Meanwhile, there are tentative and encouraging signs of a firming in wages, seen most clearly in the data on average hourly earnings, which are rising faster than inflation and productivity.  All told, labor market indicators show an economy on solid footing.  
Recent spending data have been less positive than the labor market data.  Growth 
of personal consumption slowed noticeably in the first quarter.  Business fixed investment has fallen for two consecutive quarters, mainly because of  a steep decline in 
energy -related capital expenditures.  As a result, gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth  - 2 - 
over the two quarters end ing in  March 2016 is estimated to have averaged only 1 percent 
on an annualized basis.  This estimate may continue to move around as more data come 
in.1  And there are good reasons to think that underlying growth is stronger than these 
recent readings suggest.  Labor market data generally provide a better real -time signal of 
the underl ying pace of economic activity.2  In addition, retail sales surged in April, as did 
consumer confidence  in May , suggesting that the pause in consumption may have been 
transitory.  Moreover, stronger demand would be more consistent with an environment that remains quite supportive of growth, with low interest rates, low gasoline prices, solid real income gains, a high ratio of household wealth to income, healthy levels of business and household confidence, and continuing strong job creation.  Indeed, current  forecasts 
for second -quarter  GDP growth are for a rebound to around 2- 1/4 percent.
3   
Inflation remains below the 2 percent target  of the Federal Open Market 
Committee (FOMC) , with total inflation as measured by the price index for personal 
consumption expenditures at 3/4 percent over the 12 months ending in March and core 
inflation at 1 -1/2 percent, both slightly higher than a year earlier.  Core inflation has been 
held down by falling import price s, owing in large part to the rise in the dollar, as well as 
the indirect effects of lower oil prices on core prices.  As the recent financial market tensions have eased, oil prices have increased and the dollar has weakened a bit  on net .  If 
oil prices an d the dollar remain broadly stable, inflation should move up further over time 
to our 2 percent objective.  Inflation expectations seem to be under some downward 
                                                 
1 For exam ple, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, a 70 percent  confidence band around the 
estimate o f first -quarter GDP would extend from negative 0.7 percent to 1.7 percent , which implies that the 
spending data should be taken with a grain of salt.  
2 Analysis by Board staff finds that lagged employment growth provides a better signal of current -quarter 
GDP or employment growth t han does lagged GDP growth.  
3 For example, the May Blue Chip forecast for second -quarter real GDP growth was 2.3 percent, and the 
Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s GDPNow forecasting model predicted 2.5 percent, as of May 17.   - 3 - 
pressure.  S ome s urvey -based measures are at the low end of their recent historical 
ranges.  M arket -based measures of longer -term breakevens have declined significantly 
since mid -2014 and stand near all -time lows.  While I see expectations as stay ing 
reasonably well anchored, it is essential that they remain so and that inflation return over 
time to the 2 percent objective.   
The easing in global financial conditions since mid -February and the associated 
waning in downside risks are welcome, and in part reflect  expectations that the FOMC 
would move more slowly in removing monetary accommodation.  However, underlying risks will likely remain until global growth is on a stronger footing.  Growth and inflation remain stubbornly low for most of our major trading partners.  In China, stimulus measures should support growth  in the near term but may also sl ow China’s necessary 
transition away from its export-  and investment -led business model.  Meanwhile, the 
ongoing buildup of debt there is notable.  There is also some remaining uncertainty about 
China’s exchange rate policy.  Elsewhere, risks are posed by the upcoming “ Brexit ” vote, 
ongoing pressures from refugee flows  into Europe , and challenging conditions for 
emerging economies such as Brazil, Russia, and Venezuela.    
Despite these downside risks, I see U.S. demand growing at a moderate pace, the 
labor market continuing to heal, and inflation returning over time to the FOMC’s 2 percent objective.  The economy is on track to attain the Committee’s dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment.   
Supply -Side Considerations  
For several years after th e crisis, economic activity remained far below its 
potential , and the need for highly accommodative policy seemed clear.  As the shortfall  - 4 - 
of output from  potential has narrowed, supply -side considerations such as the level and 
growth rate of potential output naturally begin to matter more for policy.  I will turn now 
to a discussion of these issues.  
The tension between labor market and spending data is not a recent phenomenon.  
Throughout the recovery period, forecasters have consistently overestimated bot h actual 
and potential GDP growth while underestimating the rate of job creation and the pace of decline of the unemployment rate ( table  1).  For example, in 2007, the average 
expectation for long- run GDP growth from the Blue Chip s urvey of 50 forecasters was 
2.9 percent  (table 2) .  After successive reductions, the estimate now stands at 2.1 percent.  
Blue Chip forecasters also underestimated the decline in the unemployment rate .  Other 
well-known forecasts followed this same pattern, including those of the  Congressional 
Budget Office, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, and, yes, FOMC participants.  The pattern suggests that forecasters have only gradually tak en on board the decline in 
potential in the wake of the financial crisis.  
Output growth can be decomposed into increases in hours worked and changes in 
output per hour, or productivity growth.  For the United States, much of the post -crisis 
decline in estimates of potential output growth  appears to  reflect weak labor productivity 
growth rather than damage to labor supply.  Labor productivity has increased only 1/2 percent per year since 2010--the slowest five -year growth rate since World War II 
and about one -fourth  of the average postwar rate (figur e 2).  For further perspective, 
productivity growth averaged 1- 1/2 percent during the so- called slow productivity period 
from  1974 to 1995 and 3 percent during the tech- boom decade from  1995 to 2005.  The 
slowdown has been worldwide and is evident even in countries that were little affected by  - 5 - 
the crisis  (figure  3).  Given the global nature of the phenomenon, changes in factors  
specific to the United States  are probably not the main drivers.   
One factor holding back productivity in recent years has been the meager growth  
in the business sector’s capital stock  (figure  4).  This weakness is consistent with the 
weak recovery in demand .4  Another important factor is the marked decline in total factor 
productivity (TFP) growth (figure  5).  TFP is that part of pr oductivity that is not 
explained by capital investment or labor quality; it is thought to be mainly a function of 
technological innovation.5  A broad decline in the dynamism in our economy may also be 
contributing to lower TFP.6  There is strong evidence that the slowdown in TFP growth 
in the United States preceded the financial crisis, particularly in sectors that produce or use information technologies.

FEDS Notes (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, November 21), 
www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/notes/feds -notes/2014/perspectives -on-the-recent -weakness -in-
investments -20140521.html .  Their analysis indicates that investment growth over the expansion has been 
consiste nt with a model using business output growth and the user cost of capital.  In a second model, they 
show that the modest increases in the capital stock are consistent with the increase in labor supply and TFP.   
5 Over long periods of time total factor productivity is primarily driven by innovation, knowledge and the 
efficiency with which  inputs are put to use owing to the evolution of business practices as well as the 
influences of public capital stock , government regulations and other factors.   Over short er periods of time 
TFP will also capture the variations in the intensity of utilization of inputs, such as capacity utilization and 
hours per worker.   Disentangling TFP from capital deepening and hour s worked  can be challenging.  
6 See, for example, Ryan De cker, John Haltiwanger, Ron Jarmin , and Javier Miranda ( 2014) , “The Role of 
Entrepreneurship in U .S. Job Creation and Economic Dynamism, ” Journal of Economic Perspectives , 
vol. 28 (Summer), pp.  3-24.   
7 See John Fernald (2014) , “Productivity and Potential Output before, during, and after the Great 
Recession,” NBER Macroeconomics Annual, vol. 29, no. 1 (Cambridge, Mass.:  National Bureau of 
Economic Research) .  Some have argued that part of the TFP slowdown may actually be a measu rement 
problem, owing to the difficulty in measuring the productivity of health care, information technology, and 
other services.   Others see the evidence for that claim as weak.  For example, a recent paper finds little 
evidence that the slowdown arises f rom growing mismeasurement in information- technology -related goods 
and services.  See David M. Byrne, John G. Fernald, and Marshall B. Reinsdorf (2016), “Does the United States Have a Productivity Slowdown or a Measurement Problem?” Brookings Papers on Economic 
Activity , March 4, www.brookings.edu/about/projects/bpea/papers/2016/byrne -et-al-productivity -
measurement .  - 6 - 
The range of opinions on the future path of productivity growth is  wide, and the 
historical record provides ample grounds for humility.8  A middle -ground position that 
seems to underlie many current forecasts is that productivity is probably still being held 
down by cyclical factors  and lingering effects of the crisis .  As those factors dissipate, 
labor productivity growth should move up to 1- 1/2 percent or so, the lower end of its 
longer -run range.   
In addition to productivity, the other principal factor in potential output is labor 
supply, whi ch is determined by the working -age population, the natural rate of 
unemployment , and the trend labor force participation rate.  Both the natural rate of 
unemployment and labor force participation initially appeared to suffer c risis-related 
damage.  But more recent data are a bit more encouraging.   
The natural rate of unemployment reflects the matching of characteristics that 
employers are seeking with those of the unemployed.  With the dramatic labor market 
dislocations of the c risis, it was not surprising to see measures of mat ching efficiency 
deteriorate, and many observers raised their estimates of the natural rate accordingly.  But there are other factors, such as demographic change, that may have led to a decline in the natural rate of unemployment.
9  Blue Chip forecasters’ estimate of the natural rate have 
now returned to around 5 percent, about the same as before the c risis, suggesting that 
                                                 
8 On the pessimistic end of the spectrum are analysts such as Robert Gordon; among the optimists are Erik 
Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee.  See Robert J. Gordon (2016), The Rise and Fall of American Growth:  
The U.S. Standard of Living since the Civil War  (Princeton, N.J.:  Princeton University Press) ; and Erik 
Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee (2014), The Second Machine Age:  Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a 
Time of Brilliant Technologies  (New York:  W.W. Norton).   
9 For example, o lder labor force cohorts ha ve lower participation but also lower unemployment rates.     - 7 - 
these factors are roughly offsetting.  Of course, estimates of the natural rate are highly 
uncertain.10     
Trends in labor force participation add another element of uncertainty.  
Participation has been declining since about 2000 and is estimated to have a trend rate of decline of 20 to 30 basis points  per year, driven by population aging and other longer -
term trends such as the decline i n participation by prime -age males.  But the participation 
rate fell sharply after the crisis, faster than its apparent trend.  It has been important to understand how much of the post -crisis decline is cyclical, and thus amenable to repair by 
supportive policies, and how much is secular, due e ither to longer -run trends or to 
irreversible crisis -related damage.  It has been a relief to see the participation rate 
improve over the past two years relative to estimates of its trend; indeed, participation is now close to some such estimates.
11  Still, despite this relative improvement, the 
performance of the U.S. economy on this dimension has been poor relative to that of most OECD ( Organisation for E conomic C o-operation and D evelopment ) countries .  For 
example, i n the prime -age group of 25 to 54, the U nited S tates experienced a 2 
                                                 
10 Confidence intervals around statistical estimates of the natural rate are routinely estimated to be quite 
wide, reflecting both uncertainty about the correct model specification and uncertainty about the parameter 
estimates given the model.  The canonical paper by Staiger, Stock, and Watson puts the 95 percent 
confidence interval at 1 -1/2 percentage points on either side of the point estimate.  See Douglas Staiger, 
James H. Stock, and Mark W. Wat son (1997), “How Precise Are Estimates of the Natural Rate of 
Unemployment?” in Christina D. Romer and David H. Romer, eds., Reducing Inflation:  Motivation and 
Strategy  (Chicago:  University of Chicago Press).  
11 For example, a paper by Stephanie Aaronson and others estimate s a trend below the current participation 
rate, while the Congressional Budget Office’s estimate is above the current rate.  See Stephanie Aaronson, 
Tomaz Cajner, Bruce Fallick, Felix Galbis -Reig, Christopher Smith, and William Wascher  (2014), “Labor 
Force Participation:  Recent Developments and Future Prospects,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity,  
Fall, pp. 197- 275, www.br ookings.edu/~/media/Projects/BPEA/Fall -
2014/Fall2014BPEA_Aaronson_et_al.pdf?la=en ; and Congressional Budget Office (2016), The Budget and 
Economic Outlook:  2016 to 2026 (Washington:  CBO, January 25), 
https://www.cbo.gov/publication/51129.   For the argument that most of the decline is related to the severity 
of the recession and is likely reversible, see Christopher J. Erceg and Andrew T. Levin (2013), “Labor 
Force Participation and Monetary Policy in t he Wake of the Great Recession,” IMF Working Paper 
WP/13/245 (Washington:  International Monetary Fund, July), 
https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2013/wp13245.pdf .  - 8 - 
percentage point decline in labor force participation from 2007 to 2014, while most 
OECD countries saw an increase (figure  6).  The United States now stands at the low end 
of labor force participation for both men and women in this age group-- above Italy, but 
well below Germany, France, and Spain.12   
Lower potential growth would likely translate into lower estimates of the level of 
interest rates necessary to sustain stable prices and full emp loyment.  Estimates of the 
long-run “neutral” federal funds r ate have declined about 100 basis points since the end 
of the c risis.  The real yield on the 10- year Treasury is currently close t o zero, compared 
with around 2 percent in the mid- 2000s.  S ome of the decline in longer -term rates is 
explained by lower estimates of potential growth, and some by other factors such as very low term premiums .  
To sum up so far, estimates of long- run potential growth of the U.S. economy 
have dropped from about 3 percent to about 2 percent in the wake of the c risis, with much 
of the decline a function of s lower productivity growth.  The decline in realized 
productivity growth seems to be driven both by low c apital investment that is well 
explained by weak demand and by lower TFP growth.  Expectations of lower productivity growth going forward are more a function of slower gains in TFP.  Lower potential output growth would mean that interest rates will remain below their pre -crisis 
levels even after the output gap is fully closed and inflation returns to 2 percent.   
                                                 
12 Different countries use slightly different concepts for measuring labor force participation, and therefore 
cross- country comparisons may reflect some measurement issues.   However, to the extent that these 
differences are constant over time, comparisons of the relative performances will be little 
affected.   Accordingly, it is worth highlighting that the labor force participation rate in the 25 -54 age group  
has declined somewhat  in the U.S. since 2008,  while it has been relatively steady or even increased som e in 
other major advanced economies.  
  - 9 - 
Over time, our understanding of the relationship between recessions and supply -
side factors has evolved.13  There is a growing body of work suggest ing that recessions 
can leave behind lasting damage-- especially severe recessions associated with a financial 
crisis.  One recent analysis suggests that about one -third of the time , there is no 
permanent supply -side damage; about one -third of the time , there is a reduction in the 
level of potential output but not its subsequent growth rate; and about one -third of the 
time, there is a reduction both in the level of output and in the growth rate.14  
Unfortunately, recent experience suggests that the United States is at risk of falling in the 
last category  (figure  7).   
It goes without saying that economic policymakers should use all ava ilable tools 
to minimize supply -side damage from the c risis.  We need policies that support labor 
force participation and the d evelopment of skills, business hiring and investment, and 
productivity growth-- policies that are, for the most part, outside the remit of the Federal 
Reserve.  Monetary policy can contribute by continuing to support the expansion as long as inflation remains consistent with our 2 percent objective and inflation expectations remain stable.  
                                                 
13 See, for example, Robert F. Martin, Teyanna Munyan, and Beth Anne Wilson (2014), “Potential Output 
and Recessions:  Are We Fooling Ourselves?” IFDP Notes (Washington:  Board of Governors of the 
Federal Reserve System , November 12), www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/notes/ifdp -
notes/2014/potential -output -and-recessions -are-we-fooling -ourselves -20141112.html ; and Olivier 
Blanchard, Eugenio Cerutti, and Lawrence Summers (2015), “Inflation and Activity-- Two Explorations 
and Their Monetary Policy Implications,” IMF Working Paper WP/15/230 (Washington:  International 
Monetary  Fund, November), https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2015/wp15230.pdf .   
14 See Blanchard, Cerutti, and Summers , “Inflation and Activity,” in note 1 3.  The authors argue that 
dama ge from recessions may be caused by hysteresis or by supply shocks such as oil price spikes or 
financial crises.  In some cases, the link between recessions and future growth may reflect “reverse 
causation,” whereby the recession is caused by the realizati on that future growth will be lower than had 
been expected.   - 10 - 
Strong labor markets do seem to be averting some of the damage that might 
otherwise have become permanent.  Improved matching is reducing the natural rate of 
unemployment.  Potential workers are being pulled into the labor force by rising real wages and the recognition that jobs are becoming easier to find.  Over a longer period, stronger demand should support increased investment, driving productivity higher.  Moreover, as  the economy tightens, firms will have rising incentives to get more out of 
every dollar of capital and hour of work.   
Real-time estimates of potential output are highly uncertain ; forecasts of potential 
growth even more so.  We can  estimate growth of the working -age population reasonably 
well.  Future levels of labor force participation are less certain .  Least certain of all are 
forecasts of TFP.  If the optimists are right, then there will eventually be another wave of high produc tivity growth driven by the truly remarkable evolution of technology.  That 
would mean higher potential growth, faster increases in  living standards, and also a return 
to higher interest rates over time.  
What if the pessimists are right and productivity gr owth remains low for another 
decade, or indefinitely?  The consequences would include lower potential growth and relatively lowe r living standards.  Our longer -term fiscal challenges would be 
significantly greater.   
Monetary Policy  
The implications for mo netary policy of these supply -side issues have been 
limited, but they begin to matter more as we near full employment.   
For the near term, my baseline expectation is that our economy will continue on 
its path of growth at around 2 percent.  To confirm tha t expectation, it will be important  - 11 - 
to see a significant strengthening in growth in the second quarter  after the apparent 
softness of the past two quarters.  To support this growth narrative , I also expect the 
ongoing healing process in labor markets to continue , with strong job growth, further 
reductions  in headline unemployment and other measures of slack , and increases  in wage 
inflation .  As the economy tightens, I expect that inflation will continue to move over 
time to the Committee’s 2 percent objective.   
If incoming data continue to support those expectations, I would see it as 
appropriate to continue to gradually raise the federal funds rate.  Depending on the 
incoming data and the evolving risks, another rate increase may be appropriate fairly soon.  Several factors suggest that the pace of rate increases should be gradual, including the asymmetry of risks at the zero lower bound, downside risks from weak global demand and geopolitical events, a lower long- run neutral federal funds rate, and the 
apparently elevated sensitivity of financial conditions to monetary policy.  Uncertainty 
about the location of supply -side constraints provides another reason for gradualism.   
There are potential concerns with such a gradual approach.  It is possible that 
monetary policy could push resource utilization too high, and that inflation would move 
temporarily above target.  In an era of anchored inflation expectations, undershooting the natural rate of unemployment should result in only a small and temporary increa se in the 
inflation rate.
15  But running the economy above its potential growth rate for an extended 
period could involve significant risks even if inflation does not move meaningfully above target.  A  long  period of very low interest rates could lead to ex cessive risk -taking and,

over time , to unsustainably high asset prices and credit growth.  Macroprudential and 
other supervisory policies are designed to reduce both the likelihood of such an outcome 
and the severity of the consequences if it does occur.  But it is not certain that these tools would prove adequate in a financial system in which much intermediation takes place 
outside the regulated banking sector.  Thus, developments along these lines could ultimately present a difficult set of tradeoffs for monetary policy.
16 
Conclusion  
To wrap up, with the support of monetary accommodation, our economy has 
made substantial progress.  My view is that a continued gradual return to more normal monetary policy settings will give us the best chance to continue to  make up lost ground.

at 
 
“Navigating the Decade Ahead:  Implications for Monetary Policy, ” an economic  policy 
symposium  sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  
 
Jackson Hole, Wyoming  
(via webcast)  
       
August 27, 2020 
  
Thank you, Esther, for that introduction, and good morning.  The Kansas City 
Fed’s Economic Policy Symposiums have consistently served as a vital platform for 
discuss ing the most challenging economic issues of the day.  Judging by the agenda and 
the papers , this year will be no exception.  
For the past year and a half, my colleagues and I on the Federal Open Market 
Committee (FOMC) have been conducting the first -ever public review of our monetary 
policy framework.1  Earlier today we released a revised Statem ent on Longer -Run Goals 
and Monetary Policy Strategy, a document that lays out our goals, articulates our 
framework for  monetary policy, and serves as the foundation for our policy actions.2  
Today I will discuss our review, the changes in the economy that  motivated us to 
undertake it, and our revised statement, which encapsulates the main conclusions of the review.  
Evolution of the Fed’s Monetary Policy Framework  
We began this  public review in early 2019 to assess the monetary policy strategy, 
tools, and c ommunications that would best foster achievement of our congressionally 
assigned goals of maximum employment and price stability over the years ahead in 
service to the American people.  Because the economy is always evolving, the FOMC’s 
strategy for achiev ing its goals —our policy framework— must adapt to meet the new 
challenges that arise.  Forty years ago, the biggest problem our economy faced was  high 
and rising inflation.

3 Consumer price inflation, which was running below 2 percent in the early 1960s, had risen into the double 
digits by the late 1970s and was slightly above 12 percent when the Committee gathered for an 
unscheduled meeting in the Eccles Building in Washington, D.C., on a Saturday in October 1979— before  - 2 - 
credibility of the FOM C’s commitment to price stability.  Chair Paul  Volcker brought 
that focus to bear, and the “Volcker disinflation ,” with the continuing stewardship of 
Alan Greenspan, led to the stabilization of inflation and inflation expectations in the 
1990s at around 2 percent.  The monetary policies of the Volcker era laid the foundation for the long period of economic stability known as the Great Moderation.  This new era brought new challenges to the conduct of monetary policy.  Before the Great Moderation, expansions  typically ended in overheating and rising inflation.  Since then, prior to the 
current pandemic- induced downturn, a series of historically long expansions had been 
more likely to end with episodes of financial instability, prompting essential efforts to substantially increase the strength and resilience of the financial system.

By the early 2000s, many central banks around the world had adopted a monetary 
policy framework known as inflation targeting.5  Although the precise features of 
inflation targetin g differed from country to country, the core framework always 
articulated  an inflation goal as a primary objective of monetary policy.  Inflation targeting 
was also associated with increased communication and transparency designed to clarify 
the central ba nk’s policy intentions .  This emphasis on transparency reflected what was 
then a new appreciation that policy is most effective when it is clearly understood by the public.  Inflation -targeting central banks generally do not focus solely on inflation:  
Those with “flexible” inflation targets take into account economic stabilization in 
addition to their inflation objective.  
                                                 
the days when transparency was the hallmark of institutional accountability —and decided to change the 
conduct of monetary policy.  See Volcker and Gyohten (1992); also see Volcker (2008) , pp. 73 –74.

5 For a readable explanation of inflation targeting, see Bernanke and Mishkin (1997); also s ee Bernanke 
and others (1999).   - 3 - 
Under Ben Bernanke’s leadership, the Federal Reserve adopted many of the 
features associated with flexible inflation targeting.6  We mad e great advances in 
transparency and communications, with the initiation of quarterly press conferences and 
the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which comprises the individual economic forecasts of FOMC participants.   During that time, then –Board Vic e Chair Janet Yellen 
led an effort on behalf of the FOMC to codify the Committee’s approach to monetary policy.  I n January 2012, the Committee issued its first Statement on Longer -Run Goals 
and Monetary Policy Strategy, which we often refer to as the cons ensus statement .  A 
central part  of this statement was the articulation of a longer -run inflation goal of 
2 percent.
7  Because the structure of the labor market is strongly influenced by 
nonmonetary factors that can change over time, the Committee did not set a numerical  
objective for maximum employment .  However , the statement affirmed the Committee ’s 
commit ment  to fulfilling both of its congressionally mandated goals.  The 2012 statement 
was a significant milestone , reflecting lessons learned from  fightin g high inflation as well 
as from experience around the world with flexible inflation targeting .  The statement 
largely articulated the policy framework the Committee had been following for some time.
8 
Motivation for the Review  
The completion of the or iginal consensus statement in January 2012 occurred  
early on in the recovery from the Global Financial Crisis, when notions of what the “ new 
normal” might bring were quite uncertain .  Since then, our understanding of the economy

and, more recently, Svensson (2020) .

has evolved in ways that are central to monetary policy.  Of course, the conduct of 
monetary policy has also evolved.  A key purpose of our review has been to take stock of the lessons learned over this period and identify any further changes in our moneta ry 
policy framework that could enhance our ability to achieve our  maximum- employment 
and price -stability objectives in the years ahead.
9   
Our evolving understanding of four key economic developments motivated our 
review .  First , assessments of the potenti al, or longer -run, growth rate of the economy 
have declined.  For example, since January 2012, the median estimate of potential growth from FOMC participants has fallen from 2.5 percent to 1.8 percent (see figure 1).  Some slowing in growth relative to ear lier decades was to be expected, reflecting slowing 
population growth and the aging of the population .  More troubling has been the decline 
in productivity growth, which is the primary driver of improving living standards over time.
10 
Second, the general le vel of interest rates  has fallen both here in the United States 
and around the world.  Estimates of the neutral federal funds rate, which is the rate consistent  with the economy operating at full strength and with stable inflation, have 
fallen substantially, in large part reflect ing a fall in the equilibrium real interest rate, or 
“r-star.”  This rate is not affected by monetary policy but instead is driven by 
fundamental factors in the economy, including demographics and productivity growth —
the same factor s that drive potential economic growth.
11  The median estimate from 
                                                 
9 On the benefits of holding a review, see Fuhrer and others (2018).  
10 Between 1995 and 2003, business -sector output per hour increased at an annual rate of 3.4 percent, and it 
has risen only 1.4 percent since then.  Fernald (2015) suggests 2003 as a break point for the beginning of 
the productivity slowdown.  See also Ferna ld (2018) , Gordon (2017),  and Powell (2018).  
11 Estimates of r -star have fallen between 2 and 3 percentage points over the past two decades.  For 
evidence on the secular decline in interest rates in the United States and abroad see, for instance, Holston,  - 5 - 
FOMC participants of the neutral federal funds rate has fallen by nearly half since early 
2012, from 4.25 percent to 2.5 percent (see figure 2).  
 This decline in assessments of the neutral federal funds rate has profound 
implications for monetary policy.  With interest rates generally running closer to their effective lower bound even in good times, the Fed has less scope to support the economy during an economic downturn by simply cutting t he federal funds rate.
12  The result can 
be worse economic outcomes in terms of both employment and price stability, with the costs of such outcomes likely falling hardest on those least able to bear them.  
Third, and on a happier note, the record -long expan sion that ended earlier this 
year led to the best labor market  we had seen in some time .  The unemployment rate 
hovered near 50- year lows for roughly 2 years , well below most estimates of its 
sustainable level .  And the unemployment rate captures only part  of the story.  Having 
declined significantly in the five years following the crisis, the labor force participation 
rate flattened out and began rising even though the aging of the population suggested that 
it should keep falling.
13  For individuals in their prime working years, the participation 
rate fully retraced its post- crisis decline, defying earlier assessments that the G lobal 
Financial Crisis  might  cause permanent structural damage to the labor market.  
                                                 
Laubach, and Williams (2017) and Lunsford and West (2019).  See also the recent evidence in Lopez -
Salido and others (2020).  
12 Both the experience following the Global Financial Crisis and the current situation drive this point home.  
After the Global Finan cial Crisis, the Fed held the federal funds rate at the lower bound for seven years.  
Thereafter, as the economy strengthened, the federal funds rate reached a peak just above 2 percent.  By 
comparison, the federal funds rate averaged a little more than 5 percent in the 1990s.  And, at the onset of 
the COVID pandemic, we quickly cut rates to the effective lower bound.  But since the federal funds rate 
was only about 1 -1/2 percent before the pandemic —because that is what the economy required at that 
time—our  scope to reduce the federal funds rate was far less than in earlier recessions.  
13 The labor force participation rate for prime -age individuals (those between 25 and 54 years old), which is 
much less sensitive to the effects of population aging, has been r ising over the past few years and continued 
to increase in 2019.  For a longer -run perspective, see the analysis presented in Aaronson and others 
(2014).   - 6 - 
Moreover, as the long e xpansion continued, the gains began to be shared more 
widely across society .  The B lack and Hispanic unemployment rates reached record lows, 
and the differentials between these rates and the white unemployment rate narrowed to 
their lowest levels on record .14  As we heard repeatedly in our Fed Listens events, the 
robust job market  was delivering  life-changing gains for many individuals, families, and 
communities, particularly at the lower end of the income spectrum .15  In addition, many 
who had been left behi nd for too long were finding jobs, benefiting their families and 
communities, and increasing the productive capacity of our economy.  Before the pandemic, there was every reason to expect that these gains would continue.  I t is hard to 
overstate the benefi ts of sustaining a strong labor marke t, a key national goal that will 
require a range of policies in addition to supportive monetary policy.  
Fourth, the historically strong labor market  did not trigger a significant rise in 
inflation.  Over the years , forecasts from FOMC participants and private- sector analysts 
routinely showed a return to 2 percent inflation, but these forecasts were never realized  
on a sustained basis (see figure 3) .
  Inflation forecasts are typically predicated on 
estimates  of the nat ural rate of unemployment , or “ u-star,” and of  how much upward 
pressure on inflation arises when the unemployment rate f alls relative to u -star.16  As the 
unemployment rate moved lower and inflation remained muted, estimates of u -star were 
revised down.  For example, the median estimate from FOMC participants declined from 
                                                 
14 The decline in the unemployment rate for African Americans has been particularly sizable, and its 
average rate in the second half of October 2019 was the lowest recorded since the data began to be reported 
in 1972; see Board of Governors (2020a).  See also Daly (2020) and Aaronson and others (2019).  
15 Information on the Fed Listens  events is available on  the Board’s website at 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review -of-monetary -policy -strategy -tools -and-
communications -fed-listens -events.htm . 
16 A discussion of various concepts of unemployment rate benchmarks that are frequently used by 
policymakers for assessing the current state of the economy is presented in Crump and others (2020).   - 7 - 
5.5 percent in 2012 to 4.1 percent at present (see figure 4) .  The muted responsiveness of 
inflation to labor market tightness, which we refer to as the flattening of the Phillips 
curve, also contributed to low inflation outcomes .17  In addition, longer -term inflation 
expectations, which we have long seen as  an important driver of actual inflation, and 
global disinflationary pressures may have been holding down inflation more than was 
generally anticipated.  Other advanced economies have also struggled to achieve their 
inflation goals in recent decades.  
The persistent undershoot of inflation from our 2 percent longer -run objective is a 
cause for concern.  Many find it counterintuitive th at the Fed would want to push up 
inflation.  After all, low and stable inflation is essential for a well- functioning economy.  
And we are certainly mindful that higher prices for essential items, such as food , 
gasoline,  and shelter, add to the burdens faced by many families, especially those 
struggling with lost jobs and incomes.  However,  inflation that is persistently too low can 
pose serious risks to the economy.  Inflation that runs below its desired level can lead to an unwelcome fall in longer -term in flation expectations, which, in turn, can pull actual 
inflation even lower, resulting in an adverse cycle of ever -lower inflation and inflation 
expectations. 
This dynamic is a problem because expected inflation feeds directly into the 
general level of inte rest rates.   Well -anchored inflation expectations are critical for giving 
the Fed the latitude to support employment when necessary without destabilizing 
inflation.
18  But if inflation expectations  fall below our 2 percent objective, interest rates 
                                                 
17 See, for instance, Blanchard, Cerutti, and Summers (2015).  
18 The success of monetary policy in taming high and variable inflation in the 1980s and 1990s was 
instrumental in anchoring inflation expectations at low levels.  See, for instance, Goodfriend (2007).   - 8 - 
would de cline in tandem.  In turn, we would have less scope to cut interest rates to boost 
employment during an economic downturn, further diminish ing our capacity to stabilize 
the economy through cutting interest rates.   We have seen this adverse dynamic play out  
in other major economies  around the world and have learned that  once it sets in, it can  be 
very difficult to overcome.  W e want to do what we can to prevent such a dynamic  from 
happening here . 
Elements of the Review  
We began our review with these changes in the economy in mind.  The review 
had three pillars:  a series of Fed Listens events held around the country, a flagship 
research conference, and a series of Committee discussions supported by rigorous staff 
analysis .  As is appropriate in our democratic  society , we have sought extensive 
engagement with the public throughout the review . 
The Fed Listens events built on a long- standing practice around the Federal 
Reserve System of engag ing with community groups.  The 1 5 events involved a wide 
range of parti cipants—workforce development  groups , union members, small business 
owners, residents of low - and moderate -income communities, retirees, and others —to 
hear about how our policies affect peoples’  daily lives and livelihoods.19  The stories we 
heard at Fed Li stens events became a potent vehicle for us to connect with the people and 
communities that our policies are intended to benefit.   One of the clear messages we 
heard was that the strong labor market  that prevailed before the pandemic was generating 
                                                 
19 See the report Fed Listens:  Perspectives from the Public (Board of Governors, 2020b) , which  
summarizes the 14  Fed Listens  events hosted by the Board and the Federal Reserve Banks during 2019 , as 
well as  an additional event in May 2020 to follow up with parti cipants about the effects of the COVID- 19 
pandemic on their communities.   Information on the individual Fed Listens  events is available on the 
Board ’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review -of-monetary -policy -strategy -
tools -and-communications -fed-listens -events.htm .  - 9 - 
employm ent opportunities for many Americans who in the past had not found jobs 
readily available.   A clear takeaway from these events was the importance of achieving 
and sustaining a strong job market , particularly for people from low - and moderate -
income communi ties. 
The research conference brought together some of the world’s leading academic 
experts to address topics central to our review, and the presentations and robust 
discussion we engaged in were an important input to our review process.20 
Finally, the Comm ittee explored the range of issues that were brought to light 
during the course of the review in five consecutive meetings beginning in July 2019.  Analytical staff work put together by teams across the Federal Reserve System provided 
essential background for each of the Committee’s discussions.
21 
Our plans to conclude the review earlier this year were, like so many things, 
delayed by the arrival of the pandemic.  When we resumed our discussions last month, 
we turned our attention to distilling the most important lessons of the review in a revised  
Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. 
New Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy 
The federated structure of the Federal Reserve, reflected in the FOMC, ensures 
that we alway s have a diverse range of perspectives on monetary policy, and that is 
certainly the case today.  Nonetheless, I am pleased to say that the revised consensus statement was adopted today with  the unanimous support of Committee  participants .  Our 
                                                 
20 The Federal Reserve System’s “Conference on Monetary Policy Strategy, Too ls, and Communication 
Practices (A Fed Listens  Event)” was hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago in June 2019.  See

session videos.  A special  issue of the Internationa l Journal of Central Banking  (February 2020) included 
five of the seven papers presented at the conference  (see https://www.ijcb.org/journal/ijcb2002.htm ).

new consens us statement, like its predecessor, explains how we interpret the mandate 
Congress has given us and describes the broad framework that we believe will best 
promote our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.  Before addressing the key 
changes in our statement, let me highlight some areas of continuity.  We continue to believe that specifying a numerical goal for employment is unwise, because the maximum level of employment is not directly measurable and changes over time for reasons unrelated to monet ary policy.  The significant shifts in estimates of the natural 
rate of unemployment over the past decade reinforce this point.  In addition, w e have not 
changed our view that a longer -run inflation rate of 2 percent is most consistent with our 
mandate to promote both maximum employment and price stability .  Finally, we continue 
to believe that monetary policy must be forward looking, taking into account the expectations of households and businesses and the lags in monetary policy’s effect on the economy.  Thus, our policy actions continue to depend on the economic outlook as well 
as the risks to the outlook, including potential risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of our goals.  
The key innovations in our new consensus statement ref lect the changes in the 
economy I described.  Our new statement explicitly acknowledges the challenges posed by the proximity of interest rates to the effective lower bound.  By reducing our scope to support the economy by cutting interest rates, the lower  bound increases downward risks 
to employment and inflation.
22  To counter these risks, we are prepared to use our full 
range of tools  to support the economy.   
                                                 
22 See Caldara and others (2020 ).  - 11 - 
With regard to the employment side of our mandate, our revised statement 
emphasizes that maximum employment is a broad -based and inclusive goal.  This change 
reflects our appreciation for the benefits of a strong labor market , particularly for many in 
low- and moderate -income communities .23  In addition, our revised statement says that 
our policy decision will be informed by our “assessments of the shortfalls  of employment 
from its maximum level” rather than by “ deviations  from its maximum level” as in our 
previous statement.24  This change may appear subtle, but it reflects our view that a 
robust job market can be sustained without causing an outbreak of inflation. 
In earlier decades when the Phillips curve was steeper, inflation tended to rise 
noticeably in response to a strengthening labor market.  It was sometimes appropriate for 
the Fed to tighten monetary policy as employment rose toward its estimated maximum level in order to stave off an unwelcome rise in inflation.  The change to “shortfalls” clarifies that, going forward, employment can run at or above real -time estimates of its 
maximum level without causing concern, unless accompanied by signs of unwanted increases in inflation or the emergence of other risks that could impede the attainment of our goals.
25  Of course, when employment is below its maximum level, as is clearly the 
                                                 
23 The analysis of how alternative strategies that succeed in reducing the frequency and/or severity of ELB 
recessions can induce longer run beneficial effects on economic inequality is presented in Feiveson  and 
others (2020) . 
24 Italics added for emphasis.  The 2012 statement noted that the Committee would mitigate “deviations” of 
employment from the Committee’s assessments of its maximum level, suggesting that the Committee 
would actively seek to lower employment if it assessed that employment was above the Committee’s 
estimate of its maximum level.  In practice, the Committee has not conducted policy in this way, but rather has supported continued gains in the labor market.  
25 In addition, because real -time estimates are highly uncertain, we no longer refer to estimates of the 
natural rate of unemployment from the SEP in our consensus statement.  Another reason for dropping this reference is that the unemployment rate does not adequately capture the full range of experience in the 
labor market.  The SEP will continue to report FOMC participants’ estimates of the longer -run level of the 
unemployment rate, as such information remains a useful, albeit highly incomplete, input into our policy deliberations.   - 12 - 
case now, we will actively seek to minimize that shortfall by using our tools to support 
economic growth and job creation.  
We have also made important changes with regard to th e price- stability side of 
our mandate.  Our longer -run goal continues to be an inflation rate of 2 percent.  Our 
statement emphasizes that our actions to achieve both sides of our dual mandate will be most effective if longer -term inflation expectations re main well anchored at 2 percent.  
However, if inflation runs below 2 percent following economic downturns but never moves above 2 percent even when the economy is strong, then, over time, inflation will average less than 2  percent.  Households and business es will come to expect this result, 
meaning that inflation expectations would tend to move below our inflation goal and pull realized inflation down.  To prevent this outcome and the adverse dynamics that could ensue, our new statement indicates that we wi ll seek to achieve inflation that averages 
2 percent over time.  Therefore, following periods when inflatio n has been running below 
2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time. 
 In se eking to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time, we are 
not tying ourselves to a particular mathematical formula that defines the average.  Thus, our approach could be viewed as a flexible form of average inflation targeting.
26  Our 
decisions a bout appropriate monetary policy will continue to reflect a broad array of 
considerations and will not be dictated by any formula.  Of course, if excessive 
                                                 
26 This strategy embodies some key lessons from the general class of makeup strategies that have been 
analyzed extensively in the economics literature.  The literature has emphasized that the proximity of 
interest rates to the effective lower bound poses an a symmetric challenge for monetary policy, increasing 
the likelihood that inflation and employment will tend to be too low.  An extensive discussion about how 
these issues affect the design of monetary policy, as well as the relevant related literature, can be found in 
Duarte and others (2020) , Arias and others (2020) , and Hebden and others (2020).   - 13 - 
inflationary pressures were to build or inflation expectations were to ratchet above levels 
consistent with our goal, we would not hesitate to act.  
The revisions to our statement add up to a robust updating of our monetary policy 
framework.  To an extent, these revisions reflect the way we have been conducting policy in recent years.  At the same time, h owever, there are some important new features.  
Overall, our new Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy conveys 
our continued strong commitment to achiev ing our goals , given the difficult challenges 
presented by the proximity of interes t rates to the effective lower bound.  In conducting 
monetary policy, we will remain highly focused on fostering as strong a labor market as possible for  the benefit of all Americans.  And we will steadfastly seek to achieve a 
2 percent inflatio n rate over  time.  
Looking Ahead  
Our review has provided a platform for productive discussion and engagement 
with the public we serve.  The Fed Listens events helped us connect with our core constituency, the American people, and hear directly how their everyday lives  are 
affected by our policies.  We believe that conducting a review at regular intervals is a good institutional practice, providing valuable feedback and enhancing transparency and accountability.  And with the ever -changing economy, future reviews will a llow us to 
take a step back, reflect on what we have learned, and adapt our practices as we strive to achieve our dual -mandate goals.  As our statement indicates, we plan to undertake a 
thorough public review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and com munication 
practices roughly every five years.

“Rural Places, Rural Spaces: Closing Financial Services Gaps in Persistent Poverty 
America,” a policy forum sponsored by Hope Enterprise Corporation

February 12, 2019 
  
Thank you for that kind introduction.  I also want to thank Hope Enterprise 
Corporation for inviting me to speak and Mississippi Valley State University (MVSU) for 
hosting us on its lovely campus.   
It is a great pleasure to visit the Mississippi Delta.  T his region gave America the 
priceless musical heritage of the Blues.  It was also the site of some of the watershed 
events of the civil rights movement.  But the Delta, like many rural areas, has long 
confronted the challenge of poverty.  Today I ’ll speak about three areas of opportunity 
for addressing the challenges of rural poverty-- education and workforce development, 
entrepreneurship and small business development, as well as access to financial services--
the topic of this conference. 
MVSU’s mission , providing young people an affordable college education, is 
itself a very powerful antipoverty program --for its graduates, of course, but also for other 
communities that are touched by the university.  MVSU opened its doors in 1950 as 
Mississippi Vocational C ollege.  The vocation of every member of its first class of 200 
students was teaching.  And even as it added other programs and became a full -fledged 
university, MVSU has continued to train many of the teachers who enrich, inspire, and 
spark the imagination of children who grow up in the Delta.   
MVSU and other historically black colleges and universities, or HBCUs, play a 
crucial role in their communities.  For much of the 20th century, HBCUs  were the 
primary means for black men and women to obtain the education needed for middle class 
or professional jobs.  Larger percentages of HBCU students, compared with students at 
predominantly white institutions, come from lower -income families and are the first in 
their families to attend college.  This university a nd other HBCUs support intellectual  - 2 - 
leadership, creativity, and innovation.  I want to honor you for this proud history and for 
your continuing commitment to a better future for your students  and for the region where 
many of your students were born and wil l build their lives and raise their families.1 
Challenges and Opportunities in Poor R ural C ommunities  
Today, data at the national level show a strong economy.  Unemployment is near 
a half -century low, and economic output is growing at a solid pace.  But we  know that 
prosperity has not been felt as much in some areas, including many rural places.  The 
Federal Reserve can help by carrying out our monetary policy mission of supporting 
maximum employment and price stability.  We also support strong communities by 
conducting research, promoting community development, and enforcing laws like the 
Community Reinvestment Act, which helps ensure that people have adequate access to 
financial services wherever they live.  We not only work with communities, we are in 
communities , through the presence of our 12 regional Reserve Banks. 
Poverty remains a challenge in many  rural communities.  Indeed, 70 percent of 
the 473 “persistent poverty” counties in the United States are rural.2  Unemployment and 
mortality rates remain high in these communities.  Along with lower incomes and wealth, 
the rate of business start -ups in these areas is lower.  And their r esidents have less access 
                                                 
1 For a history of the role of HBCUs, see, for example, Todd Greene and Ashley Bozarth (2018), “The 
Critical Role of Historically Black Colleges and Universities in Workforce Development,” in Stuart 
Andreason, Todd Greene, Heath Prince, and Carl E. Van Horn,  eds., Investing in America’s Workforce, 
vol. 1:  Investing in Workers (Kalamazoo, Mich.:  W.E. Upjohn Institute fo r Employment Research), 
pp. 189-94; and Ronald A. Johnson (2018), “HBCUs as Pipelines for Diversified Intellect, Creativity, and 
Innovation,”  in Stuart Andreason, Todd Greene, Heath Prince, and Carl E. Van Horn, eds., Investing in 
America’s Workforce, vol. 1:  Investing in Workers (Kalamazoo, Mich.:  W.E. Upjohn Institute for 
Employment Research), pp. 195 -204. 
2 As defined in PL 115- 31 as count ies where 20 percent or more of the population live in poverty as 
measured by the U.S. Census Bureau in the 1990 and 2000 decennial censuses (for more information, see 
https://www.census.gov/programs -surveys/saipe/guidance/model -input -data/decennial.html ) and the

to financial services.  Many of these disparities have existed for  generations, and in some 
places have roots in a history of discrimination.  
These areas also generally lack diverse industries and employment options and 
often have suffered  from a decline  in a traditional industry.  In Appalachia for instance, 
timber, coal mining, tobacco, and textil es have long been in decline .3  Likewise, the 
number of jobs in agriculture and low -skilled manufacturing , mainstays of the Delta’s 
economy, is  decreasing  as a result of  automation and outsourcing.4 
Education and Workforce D evelopment  
High -quality educatio n and training play a crucial role in extending opportunity in 
rural areas, starting with early childhood education.5  But  in many rural communities , 
access to high -quality preschool education is limited.  Mississippi is one of several 
mostly rural states where nearly half of residents lack access to good quality childcare, 
which is the main source of early childhood education.6  Many decades of research also

confirm that children who grow up in areas with better -quality K -12 schools or in classes 
with higher -quality teachers have better outcomes in life.7 
Later in life, workforce training and education are most effective when they train 
workers in skills needed by local employers.  Rural areas where traditional industries are 
declining and where new employers may be moving in often experience a mismatch 
between the skills of local workers and those demanded by the new employers.  Training 
and retraining programs tend to be centraliz ed and concentrated in areas with a higher 
population density, which puts many rural areas at a disadvantage.8  
Education benefit s both the student and the community.  It is true that some 
young people leave their hometowns to seek greater opportunity.  However, it is also true 
that young families, drawn back home by family and social ties , are the largest source of 
in-migration in many rural communities .  Young families are more likely to come if they 
believe their children will get a good education.  Returnees often bring back important 
skills and experiences and make meaningful contributions to the local economy.9 
An excellent example is Tim Lampkin, an MVSU graduate.  T im grew up and 
graduated from high school in Clarksdale .  After graduating from  MVSU, he moved to

Mobile  for work.  H e wasn’t gone long, though, before he felt called to return  to make his 
home here in the Delta.  Since moving back, Tim has founded several businesses, as well 
as a nonprofit  that helps people of color  start and grow their ow n businesses.  
Entrepreneurship and Small Business D evelopment  
As with Tim and his clients, entrepreneurship opportunities can motivate residents 
who have left rural communities to return home --or to keep them  from moving away in 
the first place.  Business ownership represents an important source of income and wealth 
for both owner s and their  employees.  Recognizing this  fact, successful communities find 
ways to help residents turn what they know and do best , including skills they may have 
gained fr om industries in decline , into profitable small businesses .10  One example of a 
community taking this approach is Clarksdale, Mississippi.  
About 10 years ago, civic and business leaders assessed what made Clarksdale 
special and how those characteristics could help the community thrive.  Since Clarksdale 
calls itself  “Home of the Blues ,” attracting tourists using the local Blues culture seemed 
promising.  Over the years, Clarksdale has created new jobs by invest ing to improve its 
downtown, and has supported l ocal businesses that cater to tourists interested in the 
community’s musical heritage.  
This growth is also creating new businesses not directly related to tourism --
businesses such as  Urgent and Primary Care of Clarksdale.   Dr. Mary Williams opened 
her urge nt care facility last spring , part ly in response to the closure of nearby Quitman 
                                                 
10 Such support systems generally include consistent and easily accessible ways for potential business 
owners to find the advice, financing, and education they need to be successful.  See Federal Reserve Bank 
of Kansas City (2015), Grow Your Own:  Entrepreneurship -Based Economic Development for Local 
Communities  (Kansas City, Mo.:  FRB Kansas City),

communities.pdf .  - 6 - 
County Hospital.  Dr. Williams worked with local organizations to develop a business 
plan and obtain the financing needed to open a business that is critical to the community .  
DeWitt, Arkansas , is another rural community where entrepreneurship is sparking 
a local revival .  DeWitt is a town of about  3,000 people.  Like Itta Bena and many small 
towns, it has seen a steady decline in population over the past few decades.  The economy 
there is a mix of manufacturing and agriculture, and many families have farmed the land 
for generations, such as the family of Tami and Troy Hornbeck. 
The Hornbecks grew up in DeWitt, starting  and eventually selling a successful 
business bui lt on a new soybean varietal that grows well in the South.  More recently,  
they have been helping lead a new industry in their community using waste vegetable oil 
from local restaurants and oil pressed from camelina, a crop farmers are beginning to 
grow locally.  This cooperative effort involves a partnership between a community 
college, a university, the local government, farmers and restaurants, and a Community 
Development F inancial Institution , or CDFI, among others.11  While still in the early 
stages, it  has led to the creatio n of several new businesses and imbued the town with a 
new sense of what is possible.  
Entrepreneurs such as the Hornbecks and Dr. Williams need support  to succeed, 
the kind of support HBCUs and other institutions of higher education have long provided.  
MVSU itself is supporting rural minority entrepreneurs through its participation in the 
HBCU Entrepreneurial Ecosystem Initiative, which teaches students how to start and 
grow a business.   
                                                 
11 CDFI Certification is a designati on given by the CDFI Fund of the U.S. Department of the Treasury to 
specialized organizations that provide financial services in low -income communities and to people who 
lack access to financing.  CDFIs include regulated institutions , such as community development banks and 
credit unions, and nonregulated institutions , like loan and venture capital funds.    - 7 - 
But inspiring s tories like th ese are not as common as they could be.  
Entrepreneurship has the potential to play a greater role in poor rural areas, particularly in 
areas whose residents are predominantly black and other people of color.  Recent surveys 
have found relatively high levels of interest i n owning businesses among young people of 
color.12  Indeed, nationwide, black women represent one of the fastest growing groups of 
entrepreneurs.13  Yet research by the Federal Reserve suggests people of color experience 
greater challenges in gaining access to  credit to start or expand businesses, which leads 
me to my last topic and the focus of this forum: access to financial services.14 
Access to F inancial Ser vices  
Access to safe and affordable financial services is vital , especially among families 
with lim ited wealth --whether they are looking to invest in education, start a business, or 
simply manage the ups and downs  of life.  Family income and savings represent the 
largest source of funding for students’ education.  However, more than half of students or 
their families also borrow to finance their studies.  And  racial wealth disparities make 
black students more likely than white students to borrow for their education.15  Similarly ,

racial wealth disparities mean access to credit is critical for would -be ent repreneurs who 
must borrow to supplement personal savings  and support from friends and family.  Banks  
often consider credit scores  when evaluating loan requests , however, and high- poverty 
regions tend to have a larger percentage of people with no establish ed credit rating or a 
low credit score.  This combination of low wealth and low credit scores limits access to 
credit or causes borrowers to turn to higher -cost credit . 
Fortunately, CDFIs are helping potential borrowers improve their 
creditworthiness and p roviding them with safe and affordable credit.  While CDFIs fill a 
critical gap in some communities, most consumers use other banks and credit unions.  In 
rural areas, this often means a community bank.16  Industry consolidation has led to a 
long- term decli ne in the number of community banks .  While  most rural communities 
continue to be relatively well served, that is less often the case in communities with high -
poverty rates.17  
In 2018, Federal Reserve staff members met with leaders in rural areas across th e 
country that had recently  experienced a bank branch closure.  We found that small 
businesses, older people , and people with limited access to transportation are most

     According to 2017 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Summary of Deposits data (available at

affected.18  We also learned that  the loss of the branch often meant more than the loss of 
access to financial services; it also meant the loss of financial advice, local civic 
leadership , and an institution that brought needed customers to nearby businesses . 
Regulation and supervision need to be carefully tailored to suit the size and 
busine ss model of different types of institutions.  At the Fed, we have renewed our efforts 
to avoid unnecessary regulatory burden on community banks , which provide essential 
credit in their local communities . 
Another means to address the  issue of branch closure s is the Community 
Reinvestment Act , or CRA , which encourages banks to help meet the credit needs of the 
communities they are chartered to serve.  The CRA has been an important tool for 
strengthening local communities .  The trend toward fewer branches  and increased use of 
technology to deliver financial services presents a particular challenge to our current 
approach to CRA evaluations.  Specifically, the current regulations use a bank’s branches 
to define its assessment area, the area for which it is evalu ated for CRA purposes.  To the 
extent that banks serve much broader areas using online or other non- branch delivery 
systems, or have so many assessment areas that examiners cannot do a thorough 
evaluation in each, the financial needs of many rural communit ies may be overlooked.  
                                                 
18 These findings are broadly consistent with the literature, which identifies adverse effects of branch 
closures for small business borrowers, in particular, as well as for low -income commu nities.  See, for 
example, Hoai -Luu Q. Nguyen (2014), “Do Bank Branches Still Matter?  The Effect of Closings on Local 
Economic  Outcomes,” Massachusetts Institute of Technology Working Paper (Cambridge, Mass.:  MIT, 
December), http://economics.mit.edu/files/10143 ; and O. Emre Ergungor (2006), “Bank Branch Presence

We believe that revisions to  the CRA’s implementing regulations should more effectively 
encourage banks to seek opportunities in underserved areas .19 
Conclusion 
To summarize my main points today , people in rural communities who are 
struggling with persistent poverty need access to high- quality education from preschool 
through college .  They need support for their aspirations to own their own businesses .  
And they need access to safe and affordable credit.   
I will conclude where I beg an, by applauding both MVSU and Hope for their 
long- standing contribution toward bettering the lives of the people of Itta Bena and 
similar rural communities.

Housing Assistance Council’s 2018 Rural Housing Conference  
 
Washington, D.C.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
December 6, 2018 
  
Thank you for the kind introduction, and thank you to the Housing Assistance 
Council (HAC) for inviting me to be part of this discussion of rural housing.  I 
understand that you will shortly be presenting awards to peopl e who are working at the 
local and national levels  and in both the public and private sectors and who se efforts have 
improved housing conditions for  the rural poor.   All of you who work in these roles are 
doing your country a great service by helping to advance economic opportunity in our 
communities.  I want  to thank the award recipients for the difference you make in the 
lives of people in rural communities.  
I am happy to report that our economy is currently performing very well overall, 
with strong job creation and gradually rising wages.  The unemployment rate is 
3.7 percent , the lowest since 1969.  A strong job market has encouraged more people to 
participa te in the labor market, another positive development.  In fact, by many national -
level measures, our labor market is very strong.   
As those at this conference are acutely aware, however, aggregate statistics can 
mask important variations between different  demographic and income groups, as well as 
significant regional differences.  For example, unemployment rates in some persistently 
poor rural counties remain much higher than the national figures.  The annual average 
unemployment rate in 2017 exceeded 10 percent in 27 persistently poor rural counties, 
and the rate was 20 percent or more in 2 of those counties.  Recent Fed research found 
that, since 2007, labor force participation rates for those in their prime working years in 
rural areas have increasingly lagged rates in urban areas.   Labor force participation has 
been particularly low for those with only a high school diploma or less.1  Research has

Signs of Growing Disparities,” FEDS Notes (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve  - 2 - 
also found that business formation and employment growth during the recovery have 
been concentrated in large urban areas.2  Data and research findings like these remind us 
that, despite positive trends in national data, the benefits of the ongoing economic 
expansion are still not reaching some communities. 
Through the Fed’s 12 Reserve Banks and their branches, w e are able to get a 
clearer picture of conditions in individual communities across the nation.  Each of the 
Reserve Banks has an active, well -staffed community development function--one of the 
great benefits of the Federal Reserve’s structure.  We get impo rtant and timely 
information on the state of local economic and financial conditions, including those 
affecting low - and moderate -income , as well as other underserved, communities.  
Our community development staff provide us with a more nuanced understanding 
of current economic and financial conditions.  They also help people in low -income and 
underserved communities overcome the challenges they face.  We support numerous 
initiatives in rural communities across the country, several of which I  woul d like to  
highlight.  
The first initiative is the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis’s longtime 
commitment to the Mississippi and Arkansas Delta region .  This region has struggled for 
decades with persistent intergenerational poverty and a lack of resources and capacit y to 
address this challenge.  Most recently, in 2016 the St. Louis Fed launched the Delta 
Communities  Initiative, and since then it has held 26 regional forums with more than 
500 participants.  These forums help to build awareness of promising tools and st rategies

(Washington:  EIG, May), https://eig.org/recoveryma p.  - 3 - 
for community and economic development.  A recent survey of participants suggests that 
these forums are making a real difference.    
A second example is the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas’s commitment to 
advancing digital inclusion in low -income ru ral communities.  Despite significant effort 
and advances made by public, private, and nonprofit organizations in recent years, nearly 
30 percent of rural households continue to lack access to broadband i nternet service.  
Also, fewer than half of households earning less than $20,000 per year have such 
service.3  In an increasingly digital economy, lack of access to high- speed internet and the 
knowledge of how to make the best use of it limits the ability of families and entire 
communities to reach their full potential.  To address this problem, the Dallas Fed has 
explored the role of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) in addressing the digital 
divide, the potential for technology to bridge the urban- rural divide in access to health 
care, and the critical i mportance of preparing workers for the digital economy.4 
Third and last, community development staff at the Federal Reserve Board and 
several Reserve Banks have conducted research to better understand housing affordability 
challenges affecting rural communities nationwide, recognizing the importance of 
sufficient affordable housing to a community’s economic vitality.  Researchers found 
that, as in many urban areas nationwide, a large portion of renters in rural communities

struggle to afford their rent --a finding that will not come as a surprise in this room.  
Fortunately, our staff also highlighted promising policy and practice solutions that have 
been implemented in some communities to try to address these challenges,  including the 
establishment of dedicat ed funding for affordable housing and the elimination of 
exclusionary land use and zoning policies.5 
While this type of research and community engagement work is a central 
component of our efforts to support rural areas, we also know that communities need 
resources and dedicated local partners to help implement many of the strategies involved.  
CRA has be en an important tool for strengthening local community and economic 
development infrastructure since it was enacted in 1977.  We also recognize that 
significant changes in the financial services industry since then have hindered the law’s 
effectiveness, especially in rural communities, and that an update of the implementing 
regulations is appropriate.  As my colleague Governor Brainard has noted, one of the 
principles guiding our CRA modernization work is that any redesign of CRA regulations 
should continue  to encourag e banks to seek opportunities in underserved ar eas, including 
rural communities.   
I understand that the HAC has done considerable research and stakeholder 
engagement to shed light on the barriers to the effective use of CRA in rural 
communitie s; all of that work will benefit our reform efforts.  The Fed’s ongoing series of

roundtable discussions in communities across the country will also allow us to hear 
suggestions for improving CRA from local stakeholders, including many people from 
rural co mmunities.  These perspectives will inform our deliberations on this critical 
regulation, and we will make a summary of our discussions available to the public.  
In closing, while the economy is strong overall, we recognize that some 
communities have yet to  feel the full benefits of the ongoing expansion.  We are 
conducting research, collaborating with communities, and assessing financial regulations 
so that our nation’s current prosperity will benefit small towns and cities alike.  The work 
being done by to night’s award recipients and by each of you in this room is critical to 
making progress toward that goal.  Thank you for being our partners in this work, and 
enjoy the conference.  ",2018-12-06,powell

It is my pleasure to welcome all of you to the Federal Reserve System’s 
11th Community Development Research Conference, cosponsored by the community 
development offices of all 12 Federal Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors.  
These biennial conferences are one manifestation of the Federal Reserve’s deep 
commitment to supporting research that helps policymakers, community development 
practitioners, and researchers improve the economic well -being of families and 
communities.  These gatherings also inform the Federal Reserve System’s work in 
promoting consumer protection and community development, and I  would like to thank 
all of you for  your contributions to this conference . 
This year our conference focuses on pathways to the middle class.  While there 
are many  definitions of  “middle class ,” I think we can agree that achieving a basic level 
of economic security is fundamental.  Surveys suggest that many Americans believe 
being middle class means having a secure job and the ability to save.1  In recent decades, 
income growth for middle -income households has lagged behind that for high- income 
households.2  In addition, economic resources differ markedly by race, education, 
occupation, geography, and other factors.  Those  circumstances underscore a two- fold 
challenge for our country: fostering the conditions that will help lower -incom e families 
reach the middle class, while ensuring that middle -class status still provides the basic 
economic security that it has traditionally  offered .

The conference organizers have sorted through the many research questions that 
will be addressed toda y and tomorrow and have taken away  three key observations that  
are fundamental to addressing the challenges related to the middle class.  
The first observation is to note the long-term decline in relative income growth 
and upward economic mobility f or thos e in the middle .  According to a number of 
measures, income has grown more slowly for middle -class households since the 1970s 
than for those with higher incom es, resulting in wider income inequality.   The kind of 
generational improvements in living standards that were long the hallmark of the 
American middle class have steadily diminished.  In the 1950s, better than 80 percent of 
children born in middle -class households grew up to out -earn their parents, but more 
recently  only around half do.  One fa ctor in this decline is the increase in income 
inequality I just noted, and another is slower product ivity growth.  This  conference will 
touch on other possible reasons for this decline in upward mobility and relative income, 
such as changes in the prospects for career advancement that vary by occupation and 
location.   
The second observation is the widening gap in economic status and prospects 
between those with a college degree and those without one.  In the 1960s, well over 
90 percent of working- age men held a job, and there was very little difference in 
employment between those with  or without  a college degree.  While the share of college-
educated working- age men  with a job has fallen from more than 95 percent in 1967 to 
around 90 percent in 2017, it has  plunged for others.  Ninety- five percent of male high 
school graduates were working in 1967, but only about 80 percent of them were working 
as of 2017.  Among working- age men without a high school diploma , about 90 percent  - 3 - 
had a job in 1967 versus a bit more than 70 percent in 2017.  For wome n of working age, 
the trends are less clear, but those without a college degree are also less likely to work 
today.  Research presented this morning will discuss some possible explanation s for the 
divergence in  employment, income , and other economic prospects between college grads 
and others.  
The third observation is that the prospect of moving up the economic ladder 
depends on factors beyond effort and talent, including your family, the neighborhood you 
grow up in, and the quality of the primary and secondary schools you attend.  Your 
chances for attending college are much better if you are raised in a higher -income 
household, a nd that advantage has increased substantially since the 1980s.  Another 
factor is geography.  Some research indicates that economic prospects are better for those 
who grow up in neighborhoods with less income inequality, less concentrated poverty, 
and bett er performing schools.  Finally, across so many dimensions , we continue to see 
disparities in economic outcomes by race and ethnicity.   
These issues  are crucial.  Sound public policies can support families  and 
businesses and help more Americans reach and remain in the middle class .  I look 
forward to hearing about your  discussions  over the next two days , and thank you, again, 
for your contributions.  ",2019-05-09,powell

at 
 
“Pushing the F rontiers of P ayments:  
 Towards F aster, C heaper, M ore T ransparent and More Inclusive  
Cross-Border  Payments, ” a conference hosted by  
the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures  
 
Basel, Switzerland  
(via prerecorded video ) 
       
March 18, 2021 
  
I would like to thank Sir Jon Cunliffe and the Committee on Payments and 
Market Infrastructures (CPMI) for inviting me to close out the first day of this conference 
on pushing the frontiers of payments.     
Last year, the Group of Twenty (G -20) asked the F inancial Stability Board (FSB) 
to coordinate the development of a roadmap on how the global community could enhance cross- border payments.  It has long been acknowledged that the existing system, while 
safe and dependable, suffers from frictions, including  processes that make it difficult to 
comply with anti -money -laundering and countering- terrorist -financing requirements, 
difficulty in managing payments across time zones, and, in certain areas, a reliance on outdated technology.  Moreover, these frictions contribute to higher costs for cross -
border transactions.  
As with many aspects of life these days, the COVID -19 pandemic has shined a 
light on the less efficient areas of our current payment system and accelerated the desire 
for improvement and digitalization.  Even before the pandemic, advancements in the 
private sector served as a catalyst to get the attention of consumers and to prompt more engagement by the public sector.  
The goal of the FSB roadmap is simple —to create an ecosystem for cross -border 
payments that is faster, cheaper, more transparent, and more inclusive.  A year into the process, I am encouraged that we are making meaningful progress.  The stage 3 report released in October laid out a practical set of steps for moving ahead on the 19 buil ding 
blocks that will bring about an improved system.
1 
 
1 See Financial Stability Board (2020), Enhancing Cross -Border Payments:  Stage 3 Roadmap (Basel, 
Switzerland:  FSB, October), https://www.fsb.org/wp -content/uploads/P131020 -1.pdf .   - 2 - 
Indeed, the themes discussed in the four sessions of the conference today 
correspond well to approaches described in the building blocks.  The title of the first 
panel sets up a choice between “improv ing existing rails or laying new tracks.”  As the 
roadmap makes clear, one of the keys to moving forward will be doing both—improving the existing system where we can while also evaluating the potential of and the best uses for emerging technologies.  As a n example, the Federal Reserve is working to improve 
the current system through the introduction of instant or fast payments via the FedNow Service.
2  The  service will be designed to maintain uninterrupted processing—24 hours a 
day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year —with security features that will ensure payment 
integrity and data security.   The target launch date is sometime 2023.* 
The Federal Reserve is also doing its part to examine the role of new 
technologies.  Experiments with central ba nk digital currencies (CBDCs) are being 
conducted at the Board of Governors, as well as complementary efforts by the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Boston in collaboration with researchers at MIT.  In addition, a recent 
report from the Bank for International Settlements and a group of seven central banks, which includes the Fed, assessed  the feasibility of CBDCs in helping central banks 
deliver their public policy objectives .
3  Relevant to today’s topic, one of the three key 
principles highlighted in the report i s that a CBDC needs to coexist with cash and other 
types of money in a flexible and innovative payment system.

Improvements in the global payments system will come not just from the public 
sector, but from the private sector as well.  As today’s second p anel, “Of Lions and 
Unicorns,” described, the private sector has the experience and expertise to develop 
consumer -facing infrastructure that improves and simplifies how the public engages with 
the financial system.  Digitalization of financial services, co mbined with an improved 
consumer experience, can help increase financial inclusion, particularly in countries or areas with a large unbanked population.  
And the last two panels of the day, “Addressing Legal Barriers to Cross -Border 
Payments” and “Harmonis ed Data to Oil the Cross -Border Payments Machinery,” 
highlight that improving the system must be a collaborative effort.  By definition, cross -
border payments involve multiple jurisdictions.  So it will only be through countries working together, via all of the international forums —the Group of Seven, the G -20, the 
CPMI, the FSB, and others —that solutions will be possible.   
And, finally, it is only by engaging all stakeholders —policymakers, private -sector 
participants, and academia—as this conference is do ing, that we will achieve the 
improved payments ecosystem we are striving toward. 
The COVID crisis has brought into even sharper focus the need to address the 
limitations of our current arrangements for cross -border payments.  And as this 
conference amply demonstrates, despite the challenges of this last year , we still have 
been able to make important progress.  I again thank the CPMI and Jon Cunliffe for their leadership and look forward to working together as we improve these payments for businesses and i ndividuals alike.

Clearinghouses, Financial Stab ility, and Financial Reform 
   
Remarks by

Chairman 
 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System

2011 Financial Markets Conference 
 
sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta

April 4, 2011 
  
I am pleased to speak once again at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s 
Financial Markets Conference.  This year’s conference covers an  interesting mix of 
topics bearing on the vital ongoing global deba te on how best to prevent and respond to 
financial crises.   Tonight I would like to discuss post-crisis reform as it relates to a prominent part 
of our financial market infrastructure--nam ely, clearinghouses for payments, securities, 
and derivatives transactions.  This audience, I know, recognizes the im portance of what is 
often called the “plumbing” of the financial syst em--a set of institutions that very safely 
and efficiently handles, under most circum stances, enormous volumes of financial 
transactions each day.  Because clearinghous es and other parts of the financial 
infrastructure fared relatively well during th e crisis--despite moments of significant 
stress--the public debate on financial refo rm has understandably focused on the risks 
posed by so-called too-big-to-fail financial firms,  whose dramatic failur es or near failures 
put our financial system and economy in dire jeopardy.  Nevertheless, the smooth 
operation and financial soundness of clearinghouses and related institutions are essential 
for financial stability, and we must  not take them for granted.   
Importantly, title 8 of the Dodd-Fra nk Wall Street Reform and Consumer 
Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) contai ns provisions aimed at improving the 
transparency, resilience, a nd financial strength of clea ringhouses, which the act calls 
financial market  utilities .  Recognizing the systemic impor tance of clearin ghouses, title 8 
also challenges U.S. regulatory authoritie s to improve and better coordinate their 
oversight of these institutions.  Moreover, to put into effect the macroprudential or 
systemic approach to regulation and overs ight encouraged by the Dodd-Frank Act,  
 - 2 -
regulators will have to work to gain great er insight into the complex linkages among 
clearinghouses as well as those between clearinghouses  and the financial firms that rely 
on and support them. 
 The Development of Clearinghouses and Their Economic Rationale  
 Clearinghouses have been around a long time and have been used for many types 
of transactions, yet virtually  all clearinghouses perform certa in basic functions.  Notably, 
by centralizing and standardizing specific cla sses of financial tran sactions, clearinghouses 
reduce the costs and operational risks of cl earing and settlement among multiple market 
participants.  In many cases they also act as  a guarantor of trans actions--the counterparty 
to every trade--thereby helping to reduce c ounterparty credit and liquidity risks.  
However, the flip side of the centralizati on of clearing and settlement activities in 
clearinghouses is the con centration of substantial financia l and operational risk in a small 
number of organizations, a development with potentially important systemic 
implications.  Because the failure of, or  loss of confidence in, a major clearinghouse 
would create enormous uncertainty about th e status of initiate d transactions and, 
consequently, about the financial positions  of clearinghouse participants and their 
customers, strong risk management at these organizations as well as  effective prudential 
oversight is essential. 
 A historical perspective is helpfu l for understanding the economics of 
clearinghouses and the implications of their ope rations for financial stability.  The first 
important clearinghouse in the United Stat es, the New York Clearing House, was 
founded by New York City’s commercial ba nks in 1853 to streamline the clearing and 
settling of checks.  By one account, before the New York Clearing House was set up, the  
 - 3 -
clearing and settlement process involved em ployees from 60 banks crisscrossing each 
other’s paths through the city streets to present checks, a time-consuming process filled 
with “confusion, disputes and unavoidable blunders.”1  The establishment of the 
clearinghouse improved the situation almost im mediately, resulting in significant savings 
in time, effort, and financial costs.2  By the late 19th century, check clearinghouses had 
been established across the United States.3  Large segments of the financial system came 
to rely on the efficiency and integrity of da ily settlements by the clearinghouses.  Indeed, 
as these institutions developed, the roles of clearinghouses  and clearinghouse 
associations--the groups of firms that us ed and supported indivi dual clearinghouses--went 
well beyond purely operational func tions:  In the years prior to  the establishment of the 
Federal Reserve, to increase public confid ence in banks, clearinghouse associations at 
times took on quasi-governmental supervisory functions--for example, by examining the 
financial condition of members rumored to be  experiencing difficulties--and even served 
at times as lender of last resort  to individual clearinghouse members. 
 In the securities and derivatives market s, the story unfolded a bit later and was 
more complex than in the case of checks.  Ne vertheless, many of the essential themes are 
the same.  In 1892, on the centennial of the famous Buttonwood Agreement, the New York Stock Exchange took its first steps to improve clearing and settlement by creating a

clearinghouse for limited type s of brokers’ trades.4  Faced with growing volumes of 
trading and the associated clearing costs after World War I, the New York Stock Exchange took a further step in 1920 by estab lishing the Stock Cleari ng Corporation; this 
new clearinghouse reduced the number of ch ecks needed for settlements by up to 90 
percent and the volume of funds and cr edit needed by 70 percent or more.

   It was not until the dramatic increase in  equity trading volumes in the late 1960s, 
however, that backlogs of trad ing tickets, confirmations, and delivery instructions caused 
the infamous “paperwork crisis” that led the exchange to curtail tr ading hours and close 
on Wednesdays for six months in order to manage the situation.6  The paperwork crisis 
represented more than a set of operational problems for fina ncial institutions and other 
market participants.  Unprocessed instructi ons and delivery failure s also increased the 
financial risks faced by many firms, leading to  supervisory concerns about the ability of 
firms to control and monitor their securities holdings and exposures and to manage their 
financial positions appropriately.  
 These risks clearly need ed to be addressed.  Pressed by the Congress and 
regulators, the industry began in the mid-1970s to establish central securities depositories 
and central counterparties (CCP s) to immobilize paper certif icates, encourage multilateral 
netting of trades, reduce pre- settlement risk through the gua rantee of trades, and conduct 
securities settlements through “book entries” to electronic re cords. The result of these 
efforts was a set of critical electronic infras tructures to centralize and coordinate clearing

and settlement, including the es tablishment of CCPs to provi de settlement guarantees and 
reduce counterparty risk.  
The market for government securities saw reforms as well, following the failures 
in the early 1980s of several smaller govern ment securities dealers and increasing 
concerns about the integrity of  clearing in that market.  In  1986, authorities and market 
participants developed a CCP for over-the-coun ter (OTC) government securities trades to 
augment bilateral clearing, at the time the domi nant practice.  Today, this CCP is part of 
the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, a subs idiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing 
Corporation.      In the case of exchange-traded deri vatives, the significant benefits of 
clearinghouses likewise became apparent over  time.  The Chicago Board of Trade 
(CBOT), now part of the CME Group, was established in 1848.  After various 
experiments to manage the paperwork asso ciated with growing trading volumes, the 
CBOT established a clearinghouse in 1883.  A lthough the role of the clearinghouse was 
initially limited, it significantly reduced back-office work and the amount of funds and 
credit needed by its members.
7  In 1925, the members of the CBOT set up a full-fledged 
and independent central count erparty--The Board of Trad e Clearing Corporation, now 
called The Clearing Corporation- -to provide the guarantee and settlement functions that 
are familiar today.8  Risk-management tools such as margining systems and default funds 
were adopted to backstop the guarantee provided by the clearinghouse.  The use of CCPs

for exchange-traded derivatives continues to evolve.  For example, a new CCP that 
combines the clearing of futures on Eurodolla rs and U.S. Treasury securities with 
positions in fixed-income instruments, New York  Portfolio Clearing, launched in March.     
Clearinghouses and Financial Crises  
 As clearinghouses developed, their resili ence--in particular, their ability to 
manage their liquidity and ensure the integr ity of transactions under stressed conditions--
was tested by financial shocks and crises.  I’ll briefly discuss th ree historical episodes 
that tested the financial infr astructure:  the financial pani c of 1907, the 1987 stock market 
crash, and the recent crisis.  Although the clear inghouses of the time survived all of these 
episodes, in each case the problems they faced demonstrated potential vulnerabilities and 
a need for reform.  More generally, these epis odes warn us to remain vigilant and to 
guard against complacency; complexity and change in the financial system will continue to present new challenges to stability, as they have in the past.  
 I noted earlier the development of cl earinghouses for checks in cities around the 
country in the second half of the 19th centu ry.  In the financia l panic of 1907, which 
involved depositor runs on banks and trust comp anies in New York and elsewhere, check 
clearinghouses struggled to obtain the liquidity needed to complete daily settlements.  To 
avoid settlement failures and address a wider ne ed for liquidity, including liquidity being 
demanded by the anxious depositors of tr oubled banks, many clearinghouses followed a 
practice that sprang up shortly  after the founding of the New York Clearing House.  
Specifically, members of the clearinghouse, as  a group, issued collateralized loans in the 
form of “clearinghouse loan certificates” to t hose members that were short of liquidity 
needed for settlements; in a real sense, th e clearinghouse served as a private-sector lender  
 - 7 -
(or liquidity provider) of last resort.  Some cleari nghouses even issued small-
denomination certificates that circulated widely outside th e clearinghouse as a substitute 
for currency.9  Although these measures were helpfu l, demands grew for public action to 
address the problem of recurrent panics.  Th ese demands ultimately led to the formation 
of the Federal Reserve in 1913, in part to act as  a liquidity provider of  last resort as well 
as to strengthen the supervis ion of state-chartered banks. 
  Eighty years later, the 1987 stock mark et crash provided a marketwide test for 
securities and derivatives cl earinghouses, as well as their members, banks, and related 
institutions.10  Surging volumes of trades and ex traordinary price volatility during the 
week of October 19th created errors and delays in confir ming stock trades, severe 
operational and financial stress at cleari ng members, and heavy liquidity demands 
throughout the financial markets.11  In the derivatives markets, multiple intraday margin 
calls were made to protect the clearinghous es, but banks sometimes delayed making key 
payments to and from the clearinghouses, adding to the uncertainty.  Meanwhile, the 
clearinghouses themselves apparently absorbed  significant amounts of intraday liquidity 
from the markets by collecting, but not alwa ys paying out, so-called variation margin--
payments that investors were required to make  as the values of their holdings plunged.  In 
reviewing the episode, the Brady Commi ssion noted that although the clearinghouse

system avoided defaults, investor uncertainti es about the viability  of the clearinghouses, 
as well as about the ability of  major broker-dealers to meet their obligations, intensified 
market fluctuations and panic.12  In response, the public and private sectors worked 
together to address the weakne sses that had been revealed-- for example, by clarifying the 
obligations that clearinghouses, clearing member s, and settlement banks must assume and 
by bolstering the liquidity and security of  the financial resources of clearinghouses.13  
 In 2008, clearinghouses and their member s were again test ed by significant 
financial shocks, both in the United States and abroad.  Although the events of 2008 were 
not centered in equity-related markets, the measures taken after 1987 no doubt contributed to the resilience of clearing arra ngements in the securities and derivatives 
markets.  The official sector’s support arra ngements for financial firms and markets, 
including the Federal Reserv e’s discount window lending and special liquidity programs, 
also indirectly eased liquidity pressures on the clearinghouses.  In the global foreign 
exchange market, CLS Bank International, a system that began operating in 2002 with 
the purpose of addressing settlement risk, is widely credited with maintaining confidence 
for continued interbank trading and settlement of foreign exchange. 
 Overall, the historical record show s that clearinghouse arrangements have 
generally withstood even severe  crises.  This solid perfor mance reflects good planning 
and sound institutional structures but also some degree of good luck, as crises have also revealed important vulnerabilities, vulnerabil ities which prompted subsequent reforms by

both the private and public sector s.  Clearly, if we do not wa nt to put all our trust in 
continued good fortune, we will have to continue to be proactive in identifying and remedying weaknesses in these critical infrastructures. 
Clearinghouses and Financial Reform  
 Broadly speaking, the recent financial re form legislation bears on the future 
structure and role of clearinghouses  in two different ways.  Firs t, it aims to increase the 
resilience of these critical institutions against severe financial shocks, the issue that I have 
emphasized thus far.  Second, it also encour ages the greater development and use of 
clearinghouses to address weaknesses identified in  other parts of the financial system.  Of 
course, increased reliance on cl earinghouses to address proble ms in other parts of the 
system increases further the need to ensure the safety of clearinghous es themselves.  As 
Mark Twain’s character Pudd’nhead Wilson once opined, if you put all your eggs in one 
basket, you better watch that basket. 
The theme of expanded use of clearinghouses  as a tool to address other problems 
in the system is perhaps best illustrated by the derivatives provisions of the Dodd-Frank 
Act.  Prior to the crisis, some of the same economic forces that had led to the development of clearinghouses for other in struments were already pushing industry 
participants toward greater use of clearinghous es for OTC derivatives transactions.  For 
example, as one response to the growth of the market for interest ra te swaps in the early 
1990s, a clearinghouse was created in London in 1999 that, by the onset of the financial 
crisis, was handling a major portion of interdealer activity in those swaps.

years leading up to the crisis, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York initiated joint 
efforts with other regulators and market par ticipants to improve clearing arrangements for 
credit default swaps.  However, for several re asons, the willingness of market participants 
to move all derivatives transactions to  clearinghouses was limited.  Notably, many 
believed that the standardization of derivatives contracts that is needed for multilateral clearing imposed too high a cost on end users with needs for customized arrangements.  Market participants also were concerne d that the establis hment of clearinghouse 
guarantees might require implicit subsidies from clearinghouse memb ers with stronger 
credit to those with weaker credit.  These calculations, however, were subs tantially changed by the galvanizing 
events of 2008, notably the development of la rge and uncertain counterparty credit risks 
in many bilateral derivatives agreements.  On the heels of the crisis , the Group of Twenty 
countries endorsed a policy of mandatory central clearing for standardized OTC 
derivatives.  The aim was to reduce systemic ri sk in the financial system more broadly as 
well as to improve the transparency of th e OTC derivatives markets.  In the United 
States, title 7 of the Dodd-Frank Act inco rporated a mandatory clearing policy for 
standardized derivatives.  Other major countri es are following suit.  In the spirit of 
keeping a close eye on the basket, as depende nce on clearinghouses grows, private-sector 
participants and regulators w ill need to review risk-management and member-default 
procedures for financial market utilities to en sure that they meet hi gh standards of safety. 
 As I mentioned, strengthening the financial infrastructure is indeed a key theme of 
the Dodd-Frank Act.  Title 8 addresses severa l prudential issues asso ciated with clearing 
and settlement.  One important provision provi des additional authorit y for U.S. regulators  
 - 11 -
to set enhanced and consistent risk-manag ement standards for systemically important 
financial market utilities, taking into consid eration relevant international standards and 
existing prudential requirements.  Anothe r provision encourages more intensive 
supervision of clearinghouses  (including required annual examinations) along with 
strengthened cooperation among the relevant regu latory agencies.  And, as in other major 
countries, Dodd-Frank permits systemically im portant financial mark et utilities to apply 
for accounts at the central bank (in the U.S. c ontext, at the Federal Reserve Banks) and to 
obtain payment services.  These utilities could also be given access to emergency credit if 
private-sector sources are exhausted, unde r terms set by the Board and subject to 
authorization by the Board in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury.   
As is well understood, the existence of emergency credit fac ilities for financial 
market utilities could give rise to moral haza rd (for example, in the form of insufficient 
attention by clearinghouses to es tablishment of private-sector  liquidity arrangements in 
advance of a crisis).  To minimize moral ha zard concerns, the Fede ral Reserve believes it 
essential that the regulatory regime for th ese institutions include strong prudential 
requirements for credit and liquidity risk  management, robust liquidity buffers, the 
maintenance of adequate amounts of high- quality collateral, a nd effective member-
default procedures.   
The Board is working hard to implement the new statutory provisions of title 8.  
We are actively collaborating with the S ecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and 
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on the setting of regulatory 
standards and plans for the supervision of fina ncial market utilities.  We have recently 
published for comment proposed risk-manag ement standards that would apply to  
 - 12 -
financial market utilities that would be supervised by the Board under title 8.  These 
standards track the existing standards published in the Board’s Payment System Risk 
Policy, which in turn are based on exis ting international standards.     
 For the longer term, the Federal Reserve is working closely with the SEC and the 
CFTC as well as securities regulators and central banks from more than 20 other 
countries to revise and strengt hen the existing international standards for the major types 
of financial market utilities.  This work  is being carried out by the Committee on 
Payment and Settlement Systems and by the Technical Committee of the International 
Organization of Securities Commissions .  These two committees published new 
international standards for public consultati on in March.  We hope that the regulatory 
agencies in the United States, and those in ot her major countries, can adopt a single set of 
enhanced risk-management standards that will apply to all systemically important 
financial market utilities globally.   
Coordination among regulators, both within and between countries, is especially 
important in light of the increasing interd ependencies among financial market utilities 
around the world.15  What was once a landscape of numerous, separate clearinghouses 
that operated largely independently from one another has now become dominated by fewer and larger clearinghouses supporting mo re integrated markets and consolidated, 
global financial firms.  Moreover, the same gl obally active banks participate in all of the 
major clearinghouses, and the major clearinghouses often rely on similar sets of banks for 
payment services, funding, settlement, and emergency liquidity.  In such a world, 
                                                
 
15 Reflecting on these changes, a 2008 report by the Bank for International Settlements Committee on 
Payment and Settlement Systems noted the extensive scope of interdependencies among these financial market utilities.  See Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (2008), The Interdependencies of 
Payment and Settlement Systems  (Basel, Switzerland: BIS, June), www.bis.org/publ/cpss84.pdf.

problems at one clearinghouse could have si gnificant effects on others, even in the 
absence of explicit opera tional links.  The need for strong risk management and oversight 
will only increase as we go forward. 
Conclusion 
 Clearinghouses around the world generally pe rformed well in the highly stressed 
financial environment of the recent crisis.  Ho wever, we should not take for granted that 
we will be as lucky in the future.  Past crises, including the financial panic of 1907 and 
the 1987 stock market crash, led to significan t reforms and improvements in clearing and 
settlement that paid off in subsequent peri ods of financial stress.  Given the growing 
interdependencies among clearinghouses, along with the new mandates for central 
clearing, now is a good time to reflect on the lessons of the recent crisis and consider 
whether further improvements are possible.  For more than a century, financial stability has depe nded on the resilience under 
stress of clearinghouses and othe r parts of the financial infras tructure.  As we rely even 
more heavily on these institutions in the Un ited States and around the world, we must do 
all that we can to ensure their resilience, even  as our financial system continues to evolve 
rapidly and in ways that we cannot fully pr edict.  In short, I think Pudd’nhead Wilson 
would agree that that is  one important basket.  ",2011-04-04,bernanke

Conversation with the Chairman:  A Teacher Town Hall Meeting 
 
Washington, D.C. 
      
August 7, 2012  
 
Good afternoon and welcome.  I am delight ed to have the opportunity to speak 
today with educators throughout the country on the topic of financial education.  Thank 
you for your participation and for the important work you do.  As an educator myself, I understand the profound effect that good teach ers and a quality education have on the 
lives of our young people.  Today I hope you w ill learn from each other and share ways 
to best promote learning and, in particular, to help stude nts achieve greater financial 
literacy.  
Financial education suppor ts not only individual well-being, but also the 
economic health of our nation.  As the recent financial crisis illustrates, consumers who 
can make informed decisions about financial products and services not only serve their 
own best interests, but, collectively, they al so help promote broader economic stability.  
Smart financial planning--such as budgeting, saving for emergencies, and preparing for 
retirement--can help households  enjoy better lives while w eathering financial shocks.  
Financial education can play a key role in  getting to these ou tcomes.  Research by 
Federal Reserve Board staff members on the effectiveness of fina ncial education for 
young military personnel, for instance, found that those who had taken a high school 
financial education course were more likely to save regularly.

Effective financial educati on is not just about teachi ng students about financial 
products or performing financial calculations.  It also involves teaching them the essential 
skills and concepts they will n eed to make major financial choices.  High school students 
might not recall specific information from a le sson about loans a year later when they go

 to get their first car loan or  student loan.  However, if they understand and remember 
some basic ideas--for instance, that it’s im portant to shop around fo r a loan to get the 
lowest interest rate, to revi ew the fees charged, and to know how to contact financial 
counselors and advisers--they will be mo re likely to make a good decision.   
A particularly valuable lesson we can t each students is how to apply an economic 
way of thinking to their decisions.  For inst ance, the topic of student loan debt and 
whether students are prepared to service th at debt upon graduation has received increased 
attention lately.  Students with some exposur e to economic thinking will be more likely 
to conceptualize their spending on postsecondary education as  an investment in their own 
human capital and choose their school, c ourse of study, means of paying for their 
education, and profession with that thought in mind.  Likewise, the economic tool of 
cost-benefit analysis should help students make sounder personal and financial decisions.  
Financial education also provides a context for students to develop important 
skills that can be applied more broadly.  Making good financial d ecisions requires that 
consumers seek out relevant information fr om trustworthy sources, and that they use 
critical thinking, quantitative r easoning, and decisionmaking sk ills.  These competencies 
are also some of the fundamental abilities our schools seek to inculcat e in our children.   
As with other types of edu cation, the format and quality  of the content matters a 
great deal.  Providing financial education that is realistic, interesting, and relevant can 
help students retain information and remain engaged.  Games and simulations can be particularly effective at keepi ng students interested.  For ex ample, in 2010, I spoke at the - 3 - 
 
 
 opening of the Junior Achievement Fi nance Park in Fairfax, Virginia.2  This organization, 
as well as similar facilities th roughout the country, allows stud ents to play the role of a 
family head with financial challenges and opportunities, giving them a chance to practice 
financial decisionmaking in a realistic setting.  
Students and their parents can become financially literate together through 
exercises such as intergenerational homework assignments, which reinforce the concepts taught in class.  Such strategies allow edu cators to help adults who until then may not 
have been exposed to financial concepts. 
To provide the most effective educati on, curriculums should also have clear 
standards and goals.  To that end, the fe deral government’s Financial Literacy and 
Education Commission, of which the Federal Reserve is a member, has identified five 
core competencies that should be covered by financial education:  earning and income, 
spending, saving and investing, borrowing, and protecting.  Behind each of these 
competencies is a set of related knowledge and skills, and corresponding behaviors.  For 
example, in the category of earning and in come, students are exp ected to know the 
difference between gross pay and net pay, and information about benefits and taxes.  
With this knowledge, they can understand their pay stubs and take full advantage of their 
workplace benefits.  The five core competenci es are reflected in the National Standards 
for Personal Finance being developed by the Council for Economic Education; several of 
our Federal Reserve System colleagues are working with the counc il on this project.  
While it is important to begin teaching fina ncial skills to children and teenagers, 
achieving and maintaining fina ncial know-how is a lifelong undertaking.  The types of

 financial decisions that peopl e have to make--from paying for school to buying a home to 
planning for retirement--vary through the cour se of their lives, and thus we need to 
ensure that access to financia l education is readily availabl e at all stages of life.  
Moreover, relevant, accurate, a nd reliable financial information must be readily available 
to consumers at the time they are making their decisions.  Given the ubiquity of 
smartphones, applications for mobile devices  may be one effective method of delivering 
this just-in-time information at a relatively low cost.  For example, our colleagues at the 
Department of the Treasury are currently runn ing an “app” contest to design mobile tools 
to help Americans make better financial choices. 
Because financially capable consumers ul timately contribute to a stable economic 
and financial system as well as improve their own financial situations, it’s clear that the 
Federal Reserve has a significant stake in fi nancial education.  We demonstrate our 
commitment through numerous programs and resources offered by the Federal Reserve 
System staff and through partnerships our  Reserve Banks have formed with local 
educators and institutions.  For instance, th e Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, during its 
annual Money Smart Week, conducts free classes and activities to help consumers better 
manage their personal finances.  And the Fe deral Reserve Bank of St. Louis offers a 
broad selection of online personal finance cour ses that teachers can use along with their 
students.  To find out more about what is happening in your area, I encourage you to visit

and Financial Security among Low -Income and Marginalized Workers ,”

Welcome, and thank you for joining us to discuss a number of topic s important to 
the nation’s economy.1  This research seminar is the Federal Reserve’ s first in a new 
series called “Toward an Inclusive Recovery.”  The series is cosponsored b y the 
community development offices of all 12 Federal Reserve Banks as well as the Board of 
Governors.  Today’s opening seminar is hosted by the Board and w ill focus on what the 
recovery may look like for workers.  Since this event is  a community developme nt 
initiative, we have invited accomplished researchers to discuss their work —and what 
practical lessons we might draw from it— to inform community development practice and 
public policy considerations.  
This focus of this series on an inclusive recovery hol ds special importance as we 
think about the uneven economic effects from the pandemic.  For many of us, combating 
the virus meant being disconnected from friends and family.  Furthermore, most children 
were not permitted to return to school, leaving parent s and caretakers to adapt.2   
Yet while the spread of the virus universally upended our personal lives, our 
employment situations frequently dictated our ease of adaption .  In November of last 
year, for instance, almost half of workers with a college degr ee or more said that they 
worked entirely from home, according to the Board’s Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking (SHED).  At the same time, only 10 percent of workers with a high

school degree or less said that they worked entirely from home.3  Additionally, people 
who lost jobs were typically those who earned less or had less education.4  Hispanic and 
Black workers were hit harder than others, on average, reversing the recent improvements 
they had been seeing.5  Early in the pandemic, many workers experienced layoffs but 
expected to return to their jobs.  Unfortunately, not all have had the opportunity to do so.6   
Public policy actions, including those taken by the Congress and the Federal 
Reserve, aimed to pr ovide support to households and employers in the wake of these 
unprecedented disruptions.  We see evidence of how these actions helped, but many 
households still face challenging times.  
As we continue on the path to recovery, it is time to consider what t he labor 
market may look like post–COVID- 19.  While there  is a lot we know about jobs and how 
they may be changing, there  is always more that we can learn.  For instance, as 
companies struggled to keep afloat while meeting social -distancing directives, it will be 
instructive to learn more about how they may have adjusted operations to adapt.  These changes may have included automation or utilization of telework.  In certain circumstances, the changes driven by the virus may have sped up or slowed down preex isting trends in the  labor market, and changes  in supply chains may have affect ed

workers.7  It remains to be seen whether the recent changes in remote work and employer 
flexibility will last and influence  how people balance work and family.  Currently, s ome 
people face difficult choices regarding the availability of jobs and changing lines of work.  
So it may take time  for some people to reenter the labor force.  
The record number of job openings in May is a very promising sign that 
opportunities are incre asing, and I think that development bodes well for both households 
and the country.  Despite the encouraging pace of recent hiring, employment is still far 
below where it was.  In June of this year , there were 6.8 million fewer jobs than there 
were in Febr uary 2020.  Over 6 million people were either not working or working fewer 
hours in June because their employer  had closed or lost business due to the pandemic.8  I 
am hopeful that we will continue to build on this recent positive momentum, since there 
is more work to be done to get the economy back on strong footing, as it was before  the 
public health emergency. 
I believe that data, evidence, and research can help policymakers and practitioners 
think more clearly about the implications for improving economic outcomes for 
everyone.  It is helpful to think about the needs of workers as employers may be making change s.  Are there ways to better support workers living on low incomes or ways to help 
them manage the volatility of their paycheck s?  Are there effective strategies to better

Inflation Dynamics and Monetary Policy  
   
Remarks by  
 
Janet L. Yellen

The Philip Gamble Memorial Lecture   
University of Massachusetts , Amherst

I would like to thank Michael Ash for his kind introduction and the University of 
Massachusetts for the honor of being invited to deliver this year’s Philip Gamble 
Memo rial Lecture.  
In my remarks today, I will discuss inflation and its role in the Federal Reserve’s 
conduct of monetary policy.  I will begin by reviewing the history of inflation in the United States since the 1960s, highlighting two key points:  that inflation is now much more stable than it used to be, and that it is currently running at a very low level.  I will then consider the costs associated with inflation , and why these costs suggest that the 
Federal Reserve should try to keep inflation close to 2 percent.  After briefly reviewing our policy actions since the financial crisis, I will discuss the dynamics of inflation and their implications for the outlook and monetary policy.  
Historical R eview  of Inflation  
A crucial responsibility of any central bank is to control inflation, the average rate 
of increase in the prices of a broad group of goods and services.  Keeping inflation stable at a moderately low level is important because, for reasons I will discuss, inflation that is high, excessively low, or  unstable imposes significant costs on households and 
businesses.  As a result, inf lation control is one half  of the dual mandate that Congress 
has laid down for the Federal Reserve, which is to pursue maximum employment and stable prices.   
The Federal Reserve has not always been successful in fulfilling the price stability 
element of its mandate.  The dashed red line in f igure  1 plots the four -quarter percent 
change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures  (PCE)--the measure of 
inflation that the Fed’s policymaking body, the Federal Open Market Committee, or  - 2 - 
FOMC, uses to define its longer -run inflation goal.1  Starting in the mid -1960s, inflation 
began to move higher.  Large jumps in food and energy prices played a role in this 
upward move, but they were not the whole story , for, as illustrated here, inflation was 
already moving up before the food and energy shocks hit in the 1970s and the early  
1980s.2  And if we look at core inflation, the solid black line, which excludes food and 
energy  prices, we see that it too starts to move higher in the mid -1960s  and rises to very 
elevated levels during the 1970s , which strongly suggests that something more than the 
energy and food price shocks must have been at work.  
A second important feature of i nflation over this period can be seen if we examine 
an estimate of its long -term trend, which is plotted as the dotted black line in f igure  1.  At 
each point in time, this trend is defined as the prediction from a statistical model of the 
level to which in flation is projected to return in the long run once the effects of any 
shocks to the economy have fully played out.3  As can be seen from the figure, this  
estimated trend drifts higher over the 1960s and 1970s, implying that during this period 
                                                 
1 See the Federal Open Market Committee’s  Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy 
Strategy , available on the Board’s website at  
www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf .   
2 The first jump in energy prices in the 1970s reflected a rise in crude oil prices whose proximate cause was 
the so -called Arab oil embargo that followed the 1973 Arab- Israeli War; the first jump in food prices was 
caused by disease and poor harvests combined with low levels of inventories (particularly for grains) in 
many countries.  The second energy price shock resulted from a jump in crude oil prices following the 1978- 79 revolution in Iran and subsequent Iraqi invasion; the second food price shock was largely 
attributable to bad weather and disease.  (See B linder and Rudd, 2013, for an assessment of the effect that 
these and other special factors --including the imposition and removal of price controls over the 1971 -74 
period--had on consumer price inflation in the 1970s and 1980s.)  
3 The predicted long -run trend shown here updates an estimate made by Peneva and Rudd  (2015), which 
uses a vector autoregression (VAR) with time -varying parameters and stochastic volatility to compute a 
stochastic trend for inflation (see that paper for additional details regardin g model specification and data 
definitions).  The estimation procedure for the VAR is similar to that used by Clark and Terry  (2010), 
which in turn follows Cogley and Sargent  (2005); see also Cogley and others  (2010) and Ascari and 
Sbordone (2014) for rela ted applications.   - 3 - 
there was no  stable “anchor” to which inflation could be expected to eventually return --a 
conclusion generally supported by other procedures for estimating trend inflation.   
Today many economists believe that these features of inflation in the late 1960s 
and 1970s --its high level and lack of a stable anchor --reflected a combination of factors, 
including chronically overheated labor and product markets, the effects of the energy and 
food price shocks, and the emergence of an “inflationary psychology” whereby a rise in actual inflation led people to revise up their expectations for future inflation.  Together, these various factors caused inflation --actual and expected --to ratchet higher over time.  
Ultimately, however, monetary policy bears responsibility for the broad contour of what 
happened to actual and expected inflation during this period because the Federal Reserve was insufficiently focused on returning inflation to a predictable, low level following the shocks to food and energy prices and other disturbances.  
In late 1979, the Federal Reserve began significantly tightening monetary policy 
to reduce inflation.  In response to this tightening, which precipitated a severe economic downturn in the early 1980s, overall inflation moved persistently lower, averaging le ss 
than 4 percent from 1983 to 1990.  Inflation came down further following the 1990- 91 
recession and subsequent slow recovery and then averaged about 2 percent for many years.  S ince t he recession ended in 2009, however, the United States has experienced 
inflation running appreciably below the FOMC’s 2 percent objective, in part reflecting  
the gradual pace of the subsequent economic recovery.  
Examining the behavior of inflation’s estimated long -term trend reveals another 
important change in inflation dyna mics.  With the caveat that the se results are based on a 
specific implementation of a particular statistical model, they imply that since the mid - - 4 - 
1990s there have been no persistent movements in this predicted long- run inflation rate, 
which has remained ve ry close to 2 percent.  Remarkably, this stability is estimated to 
have continued during and after the recent severe recession, which saw the 
unemployment rate rise to levels comparable to those seen during the 1981 -82 downturn, 
when the trend did shift down markedly .4  As I will discuss, the stability of this  trend 
appears linked to a change  in the behavior of long- run inflation expectations --measures of 
which appear to be much better anchored today than in the past, likely reflecting an improvement in the  conduct of monetary policy.  In any event, this empirical analysis 
implies that, over the past 20 years , inflation has been much more predictable over the 
longer term than it was back in the 1970s because the trend rate to which inflation was predicted to  return no longer moved around appreciably.  That said, inflation still varied 
considerably from year to year in response to various shocks. 
As figure  2 highlights, the United States has experienced very low inflation  on 
average since the financial crisis,  in part reflecting persistent economic weakness that has 
proven difficult to fully counter with monetary policy.  Overall inflation (shown as the 
dashed red line) has averaged only about 1- 1/2 percent per year since 2008  and is 
currently close to zero.  T his result is not merely a product of falling energy prices, as 
core inflation (the solid black line) has also been low on average  over this period.   
Inflation C osts 
In 2012 the FOMC adopted, for the first time, an explicit longer -run inflation 
objective of 2  percent as measured by the PCE price index.

4 Trend inflation estimates from univariate statistical models manifest somewhat less stability in recent 
years; see Clark and Bednar (2015).     
5 In contrast, the FOMC has determined that a number of considerations preclude it from sett ing a fixed 
numerical target for the other leg of its dual mandate, maximum employment.  As discussed in its  - 5 - 
including the European Central Bank and the  Bank of England, also have a 2 percent 
inflation targe t.)  This decision reflected the FOMC’s  judgment that inflation that 
persistently dev iates--up or down--from a fixed low level can be costly in a number of 
ways.  Persistent high inflation induces households and firms to spend time and effort 
trying to minimize their cash holdings and forces businesses to adjust prices more 
frequently than would otherwise be necessary .  More importantly, high inflation also 
tends to raise the after -tax cost of capital, thereby discouraging business investment.  
These adverse effects  occur  because capital depreciation allowances and other aspects of 
our tax system are only partially indexed for inflation.6 
Persistently high inflation, if unanticipated, can be especially costly for 
households that rely on pensions, annuities, and long -term bonds to provide a significant 
portion of their retirement income.  Bec ause the income provided by these assets is 
typically fixed in nominal terms, its real purchasing power may decline surprisingly quickly if inflation turns out to be consistently higher than originally anticipated, with potentially serious consequences for  retirees’ standard of living as they age.
7  
                                                 
Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy  (see note 1) , the maximum level of 
employment is something that is largely determined by  nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and 
dynamics of the labor market.  Moreover , the maximum level of employment , the longer -run “natural” rate 
of unemployment, and other related aspects of the labor market are not directly observable , can change 
over time, and can only be estimated imprecisely.  As a result, views vary about what labor market 
conditions would be consistent with a normal level of resource utilization.   
6 For a general survey of t he costs of high inflation, see  Briault (1995).   English (1999) discusses costs 
associated with an increased need for cash management.  For a discussion of costs that arise through interac tions of inflation with the tax system , see Feldstein (1997, 1999)  and Cohen and others  (1999).  
Finally, high inflation may adversely affect the economy’s allocation of resources by increasing the 
magnitude of misalignments in relative prices that result because firms do not continually adjust all of their 
prices ; for a discussion of such costs in the context of the new -Keynesian model of inflation, see Ascari and 
Sbordone (2014) .   
7 More broadly, if inflation evolves  in an unpredictable manner over many years , then even financially  
sophisti cated households and firms may  not be able to avoid significant foreca sting errors with their 
attendant costs.  Such costs can arise in a wide variety of situations ; for instance, any firm, union,  or other 
entity that engages in a multiyear nominal contract may be adversely affected by unexpected increases or 
decreases in in flation, although those on the other side of the contract might benefit.   - 6 - 
An unexpected rise in inflation also tends to reduce the real purchasing power of 
labor income for a time because nominal wages and salaries are generally slow to adjust 
to movements in the overall level of pric es.  Survey data suggest that this effect is 
probably the number one reason why people dislike inflation so much.8  In the longer run, 
however, real wages --that is, wages adjusted for inflation --appear to be largely 
independent of the average rate of inflation and instead are primarily determined by productivity, global competition, and other nonmonetary factors .  In support of this view, 
figure 3  shows that nominal wage growth tends to broadly track price inflation  over long 
periods of time.   
Inflation th at is persistently very low can also be costly, and it is such costs that 
have been particularly relevant to monetary policymakers in recent years.  The most important cost is that very low inflation constrains a central bank’s ability to combat recessions .  Normally, the FOMC  fights economic downturns by reducing the nominal 
federal funds rate, the rate charged by banks to lend to each other overnight .  These 
reductions, current and expected, stimulate spending and hiring by lowering longer -term 
real inter est rates --that is, nominal rates adjusted for inflation --and improving financial 
conditions more broadly.  But the federal funds rate and other nominal interest rates 
cannot go much below zero, since holding cash is always an alternative to investing in 
securities.
9  Thus, the lowest the FOMC can feasibly push the real  federal funds rate is 
essentially the negative value of the inflation rate.  As a result, the Federal Reserve has 
                                                 
8 For more on this survey, see Shiller  (1997).  
9 Because of the inconvenience of storing and protecting very large quantities of currency, some firms are 
willing to pay a premium to hold short -term government securities or bank deposits instead.  As a result, 
several foreign central banks have found it possible to push nominal short -term interest rates somewhat 
below zero.   - 7 - 
less room to ease monetary policy when inflation is very low.  This limitati on is a 
potentially serious problem because severe downturns such as the Great Recession may 
require pushing real interest rates far below zero for an extended period to restore full employment at a satisfactory pace.
10  For this reason, pursuing too low an inflation 
objective or otherwise tolerating persistently very low inflation would be inconsistent 
with the other leg of the FOMC’s mandate, to promote maximum employment.11 
An unexpected decline in inflation that is sizable and persistent can also be costl y 
because it increases the debt burdens of  borrowers.  Consider homeowners who take out a 
conventional fixed- rate mortgage, with the expectation that inflation will remain close to 
2 percent and their nominal incomes will rise about 4 percent per year.  If the economy 
were instead to experience chronic mild deflation accompanied by flat or declining nominal incomes, then after a few years the homeowners might find it noticeably more difficult to cover their monthly mortgage payments than they had originally anticipated.  
Moreover, if house prices fall in line with consumer prices rather than rising as expect ed, 
then the equity in their home will be lower than they had anticipated.  This  situation, 
which is sometimes referred to as “debt  deflation,” would also confront all households 
with outstanding student loans, auto loans, or credit card debt, as well as businesses that 
                                                 
10 For example, Curdia and others (2014) estimate that stabiliz ing the economy during the last recession 
would have required lowering the real federal funds rate to negative 10 percent for a time; by comparison, 
the average value of the real federal funds has been only negative 1 -1/4 percent since early 2009.  Of 
course, the FOMC was able to use other policy tools, such as large -scale asset purchases, to put additional 
downward pressure on long- term interest rates after the nominal funds rate was cut to near zero; however, 
those policies had potential costs and risks t hat made them an imperfect substitute for traditional interest 
rate policy.  See Krugman (1998), Reifschneider and Williams (2000), and Eggertsson and Woodford 
(2003) for discussions of the effects that low inflation and the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates 
have on a central bank’s ability to stimulate the economy during economic downturns.  In addition, see 
English, Lopez -Salido, and Tetlow (2015) and Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider (2015) for model -based 
analyses of the effectiveness of the Federal Reserve’s large -scale asset purchases and forward guidance in 
mitigating the effects of the zero lower bound.   Finally, for a discussion of the costs and benefits of 
employing large scale asset purchases, see Bernanke (2012) and Yellen (2013).

had taken out bank loans or issued bonds.12  Of course, in this situation , lenders  would be 
receiving more real income.  But the net effect on the economy is likely to be negative, in 
large part because borrowers typically  have only a limited ability to absorb losses .  And if 
the increased debt -service burdens and declines in collateral values are severe enough to 
force borrowers into bankruptcy , then the resultant hardship imposed on families, small 
business owners, and laid -off workers may be very severe.13   
Monetary P olicy A ctions  since the F inancial C risis 
As I noted earlier, after weighing the costs associated with various rates of 
inflation, the FOMC decided that 2 percent inflation is an appropriate operational 
definition of its longer -run price objective.14  In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, 
                                                 
12 See Fisher (1933) for an early discussion of debt deflation and its effects on the economy.  
13 Very low inflation also can result in chronically higher unemployment by closing off an important wa y in 
which the labor market can respond to adverse shocks.  In sectors where productivity is lagging or demand 
is slowing, declines in real wages  might be necessary to avoid even worse outcomes, such as layoffs.  For 
various reasons, however, employers oft en try to avoid nominal  wage cuts.  ( Bewley (1999) suggests a 
number of reasons that firms find cutting nominal wages difficult, including the effect that such cuts have 
on employee morale.   Inflation is therefore often said to “grease the wheels of the labor market” because it 
permits these required adjustments in real wages to occur through a combination of unchanged nominal 
wages and rising prices. )  But when inflation falls to a very low level, this passive approach to wage 
reductions may no longer be v iable for many firms, causing relatively more of the burden of adjustment to 
fall on employment.  
14 Blanchard, Dell’Ariccia and Mauro (2010), among others, have recently suggested that central banks 
should consider raising their inflation targets, on the gr ounds that conditions since the financial crisis have 
demonstrated that monetary policy is more constrained by the effective lower bound (ELB) on nominal interest rates than was originally estimated.  Ball (2013), for example, has proposed 4 percent as a m ore 
appropriate target for the FOMC.  While it is certainly true that earlier analyses of ELB costs significantly 
underestimated the likelihood of severe recessions and slow recoveries of the sort recently experienced in 
the United States and elsewhere (se e Chung and others, 2012), it is also the case that these analyses did not 
take into account central banks’ ability to use large -scale asset purchases and other unconventional tools to 
mitigate the costs arising from the ELB constraint.  In addition, it is  not obvious that a modestly higher 
target rate of inflation would have greatly increased the Federal Reserve’s ability to support real activity in 
the special conditions that prevailed in the wake of the financial crisis, when some of the channels through  
which lower interest rates stimulate aggregate spending, such as housing construction, were probably 
attenuated.  Beyond these tactical considerations, however, changing the FOMC’s long -run inflation 
objective would risk calling into question the FOMC’s c ommitment to stabilizing inflation at any level 
because it might lead people to suspect that the target could be changed opportunistically in the future.  If 
so, then the key benefits of stable inflation expectations discussed below --an increased ability o f monetary 
policy to fight economic downturns without sacrificing price stability --might be lost.  Moreover, if the 
purpose of a higher inflation target is to increase the ability of central banks to deal with the severe 
recessions that follow financial cr ises, then a better strategic approach might be to rely on more vigorous 
supervisory and macroprudential policies to reduce the likelihood of such events.  Finally, targeting  - 9 - 
however, achievi ng both this objective and full employment (the other leg of the Federal 
Reserve’s dual mandate) has been difficult, as shown in f igure 4.  Initially, the 
unemployment rate (the solid black line) soared and inflation (the dashed red line) fell  
sharply .  Mo reover, after the recession officially ended in 2009, the subsequent recovery 
was significantly slowed by a variety of persistent headwinds, including households with 
underwater mortgages and high debt burdens, reduced access to credit for many potential borrowers, constrained spending by state and local governments, and weakened foreign growth prospects.  In an effort to return employment and inflation to levels consistent 
with the Federal Reserve ’s dual mandate, the FOMC took a variety of unprecedented 
actions  to help lower longer -term interest rates, including reducing the federal funds rate 
(the dotted black line) to near zero, communicating to the public that short -term interest 
rates would likely stay exceptionally low for some time, and buying large q uantities of 
longer -term Treasury debt and agency -issued mortgage -backed securities.
15   
These actions contributed to highly accommodative financial conditions, thereby 
helping to bring about a considerable improvement in labor market conditions  over time .  
The unemployment rate, which peaked at 10 percent in 2009, is now 5.1 percent, slightly above the median of FOMC participants’ current estimates of its longer -run normal level.  
Although other indicators suggest that the unemployment rate currently unders tates how 
much slack remains in the labor market, on balance the economy is no longer far away 
                                                 
inflation in the vicinity of 4 percent or higher would stretch the meaning of “st able prices” in the Federal 
Reserve Act.

from full employment.  In contrast, inflation has continued to run below the Committee’s 
objective over the past several years, and over the past 12 months it has been essentially 
zero.  Nevertheless , the Committee expects that  inflation will gradually return to 
2 percent over the next two or three years.  I will now turn to the determinants of inflation and the factors that underlie this expectation.   
Inflatio n Dynamics  
Models used to describe and predict inflation commonly distinguish between 
changes in food and energy prices --which enter into total inflation --and movements in the 
prices of other goods and services --that is, core inflation.  This decomposition is useful 
because food and energy prices can be extremely volatile, with fluctuations that often depend on factors that are beyond the influence of monetary policy, such as technological or political developments (in the case of energy prices) or weather or disease (in the case of food prices).  As a result, core inflation usually provides a better indicator than total 
inflation of where total inflation is headed in the medium term.
16  Of course, food and 
energy account for a significant portion of househol d budgets, so the Federal Reserve’s 
inflation objective is defined in terms of the overall change in consumer prices.   
What, then, determines core inflation?  Recalling f igure  1, core inflation tends to 
fluctuate around a longer -term trend that now is ess entially stable.  Let me first focus on 
these fluctuations before turning to the trend.  Economic theory suggests, and empirical analysis confirms, that such deviations of inflation from trend depend partly on the 
                                                 
16 Several other approaches are commonly used to abstract from the short -term volatility of overall inflation 
and thereby better discern its medium -term direction.  For example, one procedure removes the 
components of the total PCE price index with the largest or s mallest price changes before computing the 
average price change, yielding the “trimmed mean” PCE index; another uses the median price change in a 
given period, rather than the mean change, to represent the overall inflation rate.  In practice, simply using  
core inflation does about as well in predicting overall inflation over the coming year and beyond as these 
alternative procedures (see Detmeister, 2011, 2012).   - 11 - 
intensity of resource utilization in the e conomy --as approximated, for example, by the 
gap between the actual unemployment rate and its so -called natural rate, or by the 
shortfall of actual gross domestic product (GDP)  from potential output .  This 
relationship --which likely reflects, among other t hings, a tendency for firms’ costs to rise 
as utilization rates increase --represents an important channel through which monetary 
policy influences inflation over the medium term, although in practice the influence is 
modest and gradual.  Movements in certa in types of input costs, particularly changes in 
the price of imported goods, also can cause core inflation to deviate noticeably from its trend, sometimes by a marked amount from year to year.
17  Finally, a nontrivial fraction 
of the quarter -to-quarter, and even the year -to-year, variability of inflation is attributable 
to idiosyncratic and often unpredictable shocks.18   
What about the determinants of inflation’s longer -term trend?  Here, it is 
instructive to compare the purely statistical estimate of the trend rate of future inflation shown earlier in figure  1 with survey measures of people’s actual expectations of long -
run inflation, as is done in f igure  5.  Theory suggests that inflation expectations --which 
presumably are linked to the central bank’s infl ation goal --should play an important role 
in actual price setting.
19  Indeed, the contours of these series are strikingly similar, which 
                                                 
17 Another input cost that can affect core inflation is the price of energy; in recent decades, however, the 
pass-through of energy price changes to core inflation appears much smaller than in previous periods (see 
Hooker,  2002; Clark and Terry,  2010).  
18 Some of these idiosyncratic shocks are related to identifiable factors, such as changes in Medicare 
reimbursement rates or movements in the (imputed) price of holding a checking account.  (Both of these 
factors are included in the services component of th e PCE price index, but not the consumer price index 
(CPI).)  However, not all idiosyncratic shocks can be reliably traced to specific factors, as a significant 
fraction represents unpredictable “noise.” 
19 Most theoretical versions of the Phillips curve sug gest that inflation should depend on short -run inflation 
expectations, but, as an empirical matter, measures of long -run expectations appear to explain the data 
better.   - 12 - 
suggests that the estimated trend in inflation is in fact related to households’ and firms’ 
long-run inflation expectations.20  
To summarize, this analysis suggests that economic slack, changes in imported 
goods prices, and idiosyncratic shocks all cause core inflation to deviate from a longer -
term trend that is ultimately determined by long -run inflation expectations.  As s ome will 
recognize, this model of core inflation is a variant of a theoretical model that is commonly referred to as an expectations -augmented Phillips curve .
21  Total inflation in 
turn reflects movements in core inflation, combined with changes in the pric es of food 
and energy.   
An important feature of this model of inflation dynamics is that the overall effect 
that variations in resource utilization , import prices, and other factors will have on 
inflation depends crucially on whether these influences also affect long -run inflation 
expectations.  Figure 6 illustrates this point with a stylized example  of the inflation 
consequences of a gradual  increase in the level of import prices --perhaps occurring in 
response to stronger real activity abroad or a fall in  the exchange value of the dollar --that 
causes the rate of change of import prices to be elevated  for a time .22  First, consider the 
                                                 
20 See Clark and Davig  (2008); see also Faust and Wright  (2013), who make a related poin t in the context 
of inflation forecasting.   Note that the question about expected inflation in the University of Michigan 
Surveys of Consumers is not phrased in terms of a specific measure of prices, so its level --as opposed to its 
contour --cannot be directly compared with a particular measure of inflation such as the change in the PCE 
price index.   
21 See Tobin  (1972) and Friedman  (1968) for early discussions of the theory underpinning the expectations -
augmented Phillips curve.  Theoretical descriptions of  the inflation process remain an active area of 
research in economics.  In recent years, many economic theorists have used a so -called new -Keynesian 
framework --in which optimizing agents are assumed to face constraints on price or wage setting in the form 
of adjustment costs or explicit nominal contracts --to model inflation dynamics (see Woodford, 2003, 
chapter  3, for a textbook treatment).  Although these new -Keynesian inflation models can differ 
importantly in their specifics, they all tend to assign a central role to inflation expectations and resource 
utilization as drivers of inflation dynamics.  
22 In this exercise, we ignore any inflation effects that might arise because of shifts in resource utilization 
induced by the change in import prices , which are  expressed relative to core prices .   - 13 - 
situation shown in panel A, in which households’ and firms’ expectations of inflation are 
not solidly anchored, but instead adjust in response to the rates of inflation that are actually observed.
23  Such conditions --which arguably prevailed in the United States from 
the 1970s to the mid- 1990s --could plausibly arise if the central bank has, in the past, 
allowed significant and p ersistent movements in inflation  to occur .  In this case, t he 
temporary rise  in the rate of change of import pric es result s in a permanent increase in 
inflation .  This shift occurs because the initial increase in inflation generated by a period 
of rising i mport price s leads households and firms to revise up their expectations of future 
inflation.  A permanent rise in inflation would also result from a sustained rise in the level of oil prices or a temporary increase in resource utilization.     
By contrast,  suppose that inflation expectations are instead well anchored, perhaps 
because the central bank has been successful over time in keeping inflation near some specified target and has made it clear to the public that it intends to continue to do so.  
Then t he response of inflation to a temporary increase in the rate of change of import 
prices or any other transitory shock will resemble the pattern shown in panel  B.  In this 
case, inflation will deviate from its longer -term level only as long as import prices  are 
rising .  But once they level out, inflation will fall back to its previous trend in the absence 
of other disturbances.
24   
A key implication of these two examples is that the presence of well- anchored 
inflation expectations greatly enhances a central b ank’s ability to pursue both of its 
                                                 
23 An expectations -augmented Phillips curve in which expectations of inflation are assumed to eventually 
respond one -for-one to actual past inflation is typically referred to as an accelerationist Phillips curve.  
24 Quali tatively similar results obtain in fully specified structural models with rational expectations --
including the FRB/US, EDO, and SIGMA models maintained at the Federal Reserve Board --in which the 
long-term behavior of inflation and inflation expectations is  governed by the central bank’s (fixed) inflation 
objective.   - 14 - 
objectives --namely , price stability and full employment.  Because temporary shifts in the 
rate of change of import prices or other transitory shocks have no permanent influence on 
expectations, they have only a transitor y effect on inflation.  As a result, the central bank 
can “look through” such short -run inflationary disturbances in setting monetary policy, 
allowing it to focus on returning the economy to full employment without placing price stability at risk.  Indeed, the Federal Reserve has done just that in setting monetary policy over the past decade or more.   Moreover, as I will discuss shortly, these inflation 
dynamics are a key reason why the FOMC expects inflation to return to 2 percent over the next few years.    
On balance, the evidence suggests that inflation expectations are in fact well 
anchored at present.  Figure  7 plots the two survey measures of longer -term expected 
inflation I presented earlier, along with a measure of longer -term inflation compensation 
derived as the difference between yields on nominal Treasury securities and inflation -
indexed ones , called TIPS.  Since the late 1990s, survey measures of longer -term 
inflation expectations have been quite stable; this stability has persisted in recent yea rs 
despite a deep recession  and concerns expressed by some observers regarding the 
potential inflationary effects of unconventional monetary policy.  The fact that these survey measures appear to have remained anchored at about the same levels that prevail ed prior to the recession suggests that, once the economy has returned to full 
employment (and absent any other shocks), core inflation should return to its  
pre-recession average level of about 2  percent.  
This conclusion is tempered somewhat by recent movements in longer -run 
inflation compensation, which in principle could reflect changes in investors’  - 15 - 
expectations for long- run inflation.  Th is measure is now noticeably lower than in the 
years just prior to the financial crisis.25  However, movements in inflation compensation 
are difficult to interpret because they can be driven by factors that are unique to financial 
markets --such as movements in liquidity or risk premiums --as well as by changes in 
expected inflation.26  Indeed, empirical work that attemp ts to control for these factors 
suggests that the long -run inflation expectations embedded in asset prices have in fact 
moved down relatively little over the past decade.27  Nevertheless, the decline in inflation 
compensation over the past year may indicate  that financial market participants now see 
an increased risk of very low inflation persisting.  
Although the evidence, on balance, suggests that inflation expectations are well 
anchored at present, policymakers would be unwise to take this situation for granted.  Anchored inflation expectations were not won easily or quickly:  Experience suggests that it takes many years of carefully conducted monetary policy to alter what households and firms perceive to be inflation’s “normal” behavior, and, furthermore,  that a persistent 
failure to keep inflation under control --by letting it drift either too high or too  low for too 
                                                 
25 In evaluating the potential implications of this decline for expected PCE inflation, one also needs to keep 
in mind that TIPS are indexed to the CPI.  CPI inflation generally runs a few tenths of a percentage point 
higher than PCE inflation, though that differential can vary materially over time.  
26 Another complication is that we do not know whose expectations “matter” for determining inflation.  
Inflation expectations of professional forecasters (such as those collected in the Blue Chip Economic Indicators, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, or the Survey of Primary Dealers) or inflation 
expectations derived from asset prices probably capture the views of participants in financial markets but need not reflect the views of households and firms more broadly.  As an empirical matter, the little 
information available on the longer -term inflation expectations of firms from the Atlanta Federal Reserve 
Business Inflation Expectations survey sugges ts that firms’ expectations more closely resemble 
expectations from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers than the expectations of professional forecasters.  Similarly, preliminary data from a New Zealand study suggests that inflation forecasts o f firms 
are much more similar to those of households than those of professional forecasters (see Coibion and 
Gorodnichenko, 2015).  
27 D’Amico, Kim, and Wei (2014) examine a number of models that use TIPS yields to back out expected 
inflation estimates.  The  best-fitting models show only a small decline in longer -term inflation expectations 
since 2005.   - 16 - 
long--could cause expectations to once again become unmoored.28  Given that inflation 
has been running below the FOMC’s objective for several years now, such concerns 
reinforce the appropriateness of the Federal Reserve’s current monetary policy, which 
remains highly accommodative by historical standards and is directed toward helping 
return inflation to 2 percent over the medium term.29 
Before t urning to the implications of this inflation model for the current outlook 
and monetary policy, a cautionary note is in order.  The Phillips -curve approach to 
forecasting inflation has a long history in economics, and it has usefully informed 
monetary poli cy decisionmaking around the globe.  But the theoretical underpinnings of 
the model are still a subject of controversy among economists.  Moreover, inflation sometimes moves in ways that empirical versions of the model, which necessarily are a 
                                                 
28 My interpretation of the historical evidence is that long -run inflation expectations become anchored at a 
particular level only after a central bank succeeds  in keeping actual inflation near some target level for 
many years.  For th at reason, I am somewhat skeptical about the actual effectiveness of any monetary 
policy that relies primarily on the central bank’s theoretical ability to influence the public’s in flation 
expectations directly by simply announcing that it will pursue a different inflation goal in the future.  
Although such announcements might potentially persuade some financial market participants and 
professional forecasters to shift their expectat ions, other members of the public are probably much less 
likely to do so.  Hence, actual inflation would probably be affected only after the central bank has had 
sufficient time to concretely demonstrate its sustained commitment and ability to generate a n ew norm for 
the average level of inflation  and the behavior of monetary policy --a process that might take years, based 
on U.S. experience.  Consistent with my assessment that announcements alone are not enough, Bernanke 
and others (1999) found no evidence across a number of countries that the initial disinflation which follows 
the adoption of inflation targeting is  any less costly than disinflations carried out under alternative 
mone tary regime s. 
29 Some might be surprised that the preceding discussion of in flation determinants makes no mention of 
labor costs.  In the past, wages provided a good empirical indicator of the future direction of price inflation; indeed, the presence of a so -called wage -price spiral --in which higher price inflation led workers to push 
for higher wage growth, thereby in turn leading to even faster price increases as firms’ labor costs 
accelerated --was often invoked to explain the inflationary dynamics of the 1970s.  The wage -price spiral no 
longer seems to provide a useful descripti on of the U.S. inflation process.  In fact, some evidence suggests 
that, like inflation, the rate of growth of labor costs is now characterized by a stable long -run trend; again, a 
likely explanation for this empirical finding is the improved anchoring of long -term inflation expectations.  
(See Peneva and Rudd,  2015, for some suggestive evidence along these lines.)  More generally, movements 
in labor costs no longer appear to be an especially good guide to future price movements.  (This development does not  imply that wage developments carry no useful information:  Because wage growth is 
influenced by labor market slack, observed movements in compensation gains can provide an indication of 
how close the economy is to full employment.)   - 17 - 
simplified v ersion of a complicated reality, cannot adequately explain.  For this reason, 
significant uncertainty attaches to Phillips curve predictions, and the validity of forecasts 
from this model must be continuously evaluated in response to incoming data.  
Policy Implications  
Assuming that my reading of the data is correct and long -run inflation 
expectations are in fact anchored near their pre- recession levels, what implications does 
the preceding description of inflation dynamics have for the inflation outlook and for monetary policy?   
This framework suggests, first, that much of the recent shortfall of inflation from 
our 2 percent objective is attributable to special factors whose effects are likely to prove transitory.  As the solid black line in f igure 8 indica tes, PCE inflation has run noticeably 
below our 2 percent objective on average since 2008, with the shortfall approaching about 1 percentage point in both 2013 and 2014 and more than 1- 1/2 percentage points 
this year.  The stacked bars in the figure give t he contributions  of various factors to these 
deviations from 2 percent, computed using an estimated version of the simple inflation model I just discussed.
30  As the solid blue portion of the bars shows, falling consumer 
energy prices explain about half of this year’s shortfall and a sizable portion of the 2013 and 2014 shortfalls as well.  Another important source of downward pressure this year has been a decline in import prices, the portion with orange checkerboard pattern, which 
                                                 
30 For a technical explanation of the procedure used to produce this decomposition, see the appendix .  In the 
decomposition procedure, movements in core inflation affect headline inflation one -for-one; as a result, the 
contributions of food and energy price inflation are defined as each component’s price change relative to 
the core, weighted by its share in total nominal consumer spending.  (Note that the “other” category includes the effects of changes in food prices.)  The estimated contribution of movements in import prices 
is also computed relative to core inflation; thus, if import prices are rising at the same rate as core inflation, 
they have no estimated effect on the shortfall of overall inflation from 2 percent.  In addition, the 
decomposition takes account of lags in the  adjustment of core inflation to movements in resource utilization 
and other factors.   - 18 - 
is largely attributable to the 15 percent appreciation in the dollar’s exchange value over 
the past year.  In contrast, the restraint imposed by economic slack, the green dotted portion, has diminished steadily over time as the economy has recovered and is now estimated to be rela tively modest.
31  Finally, a similarly small portion of the current 
shortfall of inflation from 2 percent is explained by other factors  (which include changes 
in food prices) ; importantly, the effects of these other facto rs are transitory and often  
switch s ign from year to year.  
Although an accounting exercise like this one is always imprecise and will depend 
on the specific model that is used, I think its basic message --that the current near -zero 
rate of inflation can mostly be attributed to the temporary e ffects of falling prices for 
energy and non- energy imports --is quite plausible.  If so, the 12- month change in total 
PCE prices is likely to rebound to 1- 1/2 percent or higher in 2016, barring a further 
substantial drop in crude oil prices and provided tha t the dollar does not appreciate 
noticeably further.   
To be reasonably confident that inflation will return to 2 percent over the next few 
years, we need, in turn, to be reasonably confident that we will see continued solid economic growth and further gai ns in resource utilization, with longer -term inflation 
expectations remaining near their pre- recession level.  Fortunately, prospects for the U.S. 
economy generally appear solid.  Monthly payroll gains have averaged close to 210,000 since the start of the year and the overall economy has been expanding modestly faster 
                                                 
31 As discussed later, the current difference between the unemployment rate and its normal longer -run level 
likely understates the actual amount of slack that remains in the labor market.  If so, the estimates reported 
in figure 8 somewhat understate the contribution of slack to the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent 
and, correspondingly, overstate the contribution from other factors.  For example, if the standar d 
unemployment gap currently understates the true level of slack by 1/2 percentage point, then the 
contribution of slack to this year’s inflation shortfall is roughly 0.1 percentage point larger than the estimate 
reported in figure 8.    - 19 - 
than its productive potential.  My colleagues and I, based on our most recent forecasts, 
anticipate that this pattern will continue and that labor market conditions will improve further as we head into 2016.   
The labor market has achieved considerable progress over the past several years.  
Even so, f urther improvement in labor market conditions would be welcome because we 
are probably not yet all the way back to full employment.  Althoug h the unemployment 
rate may now be close to its longer -run normal level --which most FOMC participants 
now estimate is around 4.9 percent --this traditional metric of resource utilization almost 
certainly understates the actual amount of slack that currently  exists:  On a cyclically 
adjusted basis, the labor force participation rate remains low relative to its underlying trend, and an unusually large number of people are working part  time but would prefer 
full-time employment.
32  Consistent with this assessmen t is the slow pace at which hourly 
wages and compensation have been rising, which suggests that most firms still find it relatively easy to hire and retain employees.   
Reducing slack along these other dimensions may involve a temporary decline in 
the unem ployment rate somewhat below the level that is estimated to be consistent, in the 
longer run, with inflat ion stabilizing at 2 percent.  For example, attracting discouraged 
workers back into the labor force may require a period of especially plentiful emplo yment opportunities and strong hiring.  Similarly, firms may be unwilling to 
restructure their operations to use more full -time workers until they encounter greater 
difficulty filling part- time positions.  Beyond these considerations, a modest decline in 
                                                 
32 For a further dis cussion of the current level of resource utilization, see the Federal Reserve Board’s most 
recent Monetary Policy Report , dated July 15, 2015, available on the Board’s website at 
www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/mpr_default.htm .   - 20 - 
the unemployment rate below its long -run level for a time would, by increasing resource 
utilization, also have the benefit of speeding the return to 2 percent inflation.  Finally, 
albeit more speculatively, such an environment  might help reverse some of the  significant 
supply -side damage that appears to have occurred in recent years, thereby improving 
Americans’ standard of living. 33  
Consistent with the inflation framework I have outlined, the medians of the 
projections provided by FOMC participants at our recent meeting show inflation gradually moving back to 2 percent, accompanied by a temporary decline in unemployment slightly below the median estimate of the rate expected to prevail in the longer run.  These projections embody t wo key judgments regarding the projected 
relationship between real activity and interest rates.  First, the real federal funds rate is currently somewhat below the level that would be consistent with real GDP expanding in line with potential, which implies  that the unemployment rat e is likely to continue to fall 
in the absence of some tightening.  Second, participants implicitly expect that the various headwinds to economic growth that I mentioned earlier will continue to fade, thereby 
boosting the economy’s underlying strength.  Co mbined, these two judgments imply that 
the real interest rate consistent with achieving and then maintaining full employment in 
the medium run should rise gradually over time.  T his expectation, coupled with inherent 
lags in the response of real activity a nd inflation to changes in monetary policy , are the 
key reason s that most of my colleagues and I anticipate that it will likely be appropriate

Wilcox (2015) and Van  Zandweghe ( forthcoming ).   - 21 - 
boosting short -term rates at a gradual pace thereafter as the labor market improves further 
and inflation moves back to our 2 percent objective.   
By itself, the  precise timing of the first increase in our target for the federal funds 
rate should have only minor implications for financial conditions and the ge neral 
economy.  What matters for overall financial conditions is the entire trajectory of short-
term interest rate s that is anticipated by markets and the public.  As I noted, most of my 
colleagues and I anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant raising short -
term interest rates at a quite gradual pace over the next few years .  It’s important to 
emphasize, however, that both the timing of the first rate increase and any subsequent adjustments to our federal funds rate target will depend on how developments in the economy influence the Committee’s outlook for progress toward maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.   
The economic outlook, of course, is highly uncertain and i t is conceivable, for 
example, that inflation could remain appreciably below our 2 percent target despite the apparent anchoring of inflation expectations.  Here, Japan’s rece nt history may be 
instructive:  As shown in f igure 9, survey measures of longer -term expected inflation in 
that country remained positive and stable even as that country experienced many years of 
persistent, mild deflation.
34  The explanation for the persis tent divergence between actual 
and expected inflation in Japan is not clear , but I believe that it illustrates a problem faced 
by all central banks :  Economists’ understanding of the dynamics of inflation i s far from 
perfect .  Reflecting that limited under standing, the predictions of our model s often err, 
                                                 
34 In addition, we cannot count on expectations remaining anchored if the Federal Reserve were to permit 
actual inflation to continue to run noticeably below its announced objective after the real economy has 
substantially recovered.   - 22 - 
sometimes significantly so.   Accordingly, inflation may rise more slowly or rapidly than 
the Committee currently anticipates ; should such a development occur, we would need to 
adjust the stance of policy i n response.   
Considerable uncertainties also surround the outlook for economic activity.   For 
example, w e cannot be certain about the pace at which the headwinds still restraining the 
domestic economy will continue to fade.  Moreover, net exports have se rved as a 
significant drag on growth over the past year and recent global economic and financial 
developments highlight the risk that a slowdown in foreign growth might restrain U.S. 
economic activity somewhat further.  The Committee is monitoring developments abroad, but w e do not currently anticipate that the effects of these recent developments on 
the U.S. economy will prove to be large enough to have a significant effect on the path for policy.  That said, i n response to surprises  affecting the outlook for economic activity, 
as with those affecting inflation, the FOMC would need to adjust the  stance of policy so 
that our actions remain consistent with inflation returning to our 2 percent objective over 
the medium term in the context of maximum employment.   
Given the highly uncertain nature of the outlook, one might ask:  Why not hold 
off raising the federal funds rate until the economy has reached full employment and inflation is actually back at 2 percent?  The difficulty with this strategy is that mone tary 
policy affects real activity and inflation with a substantial lag.  If the FOMC were to delay the start of the policy normalization process for too long, we would likely end up having to tighten policy relatively abruptly to keep the economy from significantly overshooting both of our goals.  Such an abrupt tightening would risk disrupting financial markets and perhaps even inadvertently push the economy into recession.  In addition,  - 23 - 
continuing to hold short -term interest rates near zero well after real activity has returned 
to normal and headwinds have faded could encourage excessive leverage and other forms 
of inappropriate risk- taking that might undermine financial stability.  For these reasons, 
the more prudent strategy is to begin tightening in a t imely fashion and at a gradual pace, 
adjusting policy as needed in light of incoming data.  
Conclusion  
To conclude, let me emphasize that, following the dual mandate established by 
the Congress, the Federal Reserve is committed to the achievement of maximu m 
employment and price stability.  To this end, we have maintained a highly 
accommodative monetary policy since the financial crisis; that policy has fostered a marked improvement in labor market conditions and helped check undesirable disinflationary pres sures.  However, we have not yet fully attained our objectives under 
the dual mandate:  Some slack remains in labor markets, and the effects of this slack and 
the influence of lower energy prices and past dollar appreciation have been significant factors k eeping inflation below our goal.  But I expect that inflation will return to 
2 percent over the next few years as the temporary factors that are currently weighing on inflation wane, provided that economic growth continues to be strong enough to complete the return to maximum employment and long -run inflation expectations remain well 
anchored.  Most FOMC participants , including myself, currently anticipate that achieving 
these conditions will likely entail an initial increase in the federal funds rate later  this 
year, followed by a gradual pace of tightening thereafter.  But if the economy surprises us, our judgments about appropriate monetary policy will change.

Appendix:  The Estimated Inflation Model and Inflation Decomposition Procedure 
The inflation model used in the decomposition procedure includes two equations --
an identity for the change in the price index for total personal consumption expenditures 
(PCE) and a simple reduced-form forecasting equation for core PCE inflation.35  The 
identity is 
𝜋𝑡=  𝜋 𝑡𝑐+ 𝜔 𝑡𝑒𝑅𝑃𝐼𝐸 𝑡+ 𝜔𝑡𝑓𝑅𝑃𝐼𝐹 𝑡,  
where 𝜋𝑡 and 𝜋𝑡𝑐 denote growth rates (expressed as annualized log differences ) of total 
and core PCE prices, respectively; 𝑅𝑃𝐼𝐸 𝑡 and 𝑅𝑃𝐼𝐹 𝑡 are annualized growth rates for 
prices of consumer energy goods and services and prices of food and beverages, both 
expressed relative to core PCE prices; and  𝜔𝑡𝑒 and  𝜔𝑡𝑓 are the weights of energy and 
food in total consumption.  The core inflation forecasting equation is 
𝜋𝑡𝑐= .41𝜋𝑡𝑒+ .36𝜋𝑡−1𝑐+ .23𝜋𝑡−2𝑐− .08𝑆𝐿𝐴𝐶𝐾 𝑡+ .57𝑅𝑃𝐼𝑀 𝑡+ 𝜖 𝑡,  
where 𝜋𝑡𝑒 is expected long-run inflation; 𝑆𝐿𝐴𝐶𝐾 𝑡 denotes the level of resource utilization; 
𝑅𝑃𝐼𝑀 𝑡 controls for the effect of changes in the relative price of core imported goods; 𝜖𝑡 
is a white-noise error term; and the coefficients are ordinary least squares estimates 
obtained using data from 1990:Q1 to 2014 :Q4. 
For estimation purposes, 𝑆𝐿𝐴𝐶𝐾 𝑡 is approximated using the unemployment rate 
less the Congressional Budget Office’s (CBO) historical series for the long-run natural 
rate, while 𝜋𝑡𝑒 is proxied using the median forecasts of long-run PCE or CPI inflation 
reported in the Survey of Professional Forecasters, with a constant adjustment of 40  basis 
                                                 
35 This appendix was revised on December 17, 2015, to provide additional information on the definition of 
core import inflation and its implications for the longer-run rate of unemployment consistent with stable 
inflation.  In addition, the original version of the appendix incorrectly reported that the adjustment factor 
used to convert historical readings on expected long-run inflation from a CPI basis to a PCE basis was 
50 basis points.  - 29 - 
points prior to 2007 to put the CPI forecasts on a PCE basis.  (Prior to 1991:Q4, this 
series is based on the long-run inflation expectations reported in the Hoey survey.)  The 
relative import price term, 𝑅𝑃𝐼𝑀 𝑡, is defined as the annualized growth rate of the price 
index for core imported goods (defined to exclude petroleum, natural gas, computers,  and 
semiconductors), less the lagged four-quarter change in core PCE inflation, all multiplied 
by the share of nominal core imported goods in nominal GDP.36 
To decompose recent movements in inflation into its various components, the 
series used in the inflation model --for which data are available only through 2015: Q2 in 
most cases --are first extended through the end of 2015.  In the case of inflation, the 
extensions are consistent with the medians of FOMC participants’ projections for total 
and core PCE inflation in 2015 that were reported at the press conference following the 
September FOMC meeting.37  Similarly, 𝑆𝐿𝐴𝐶𝐾 𝑡 over the second half of 2015 is defined 
to be consistent with the median of FOMC projections for the 2015:Q4 unemployment 
rate, less the CBO’s  estimates of the historical path of the long-run natural rate; the 
CBO’s 2015 estimate is almost identical to the median of FOMC participants’ most 
recent projections of the normal longer-run level of the unemployment rate.  For changes 
in the prices of consumer energy and core imports, the 2015:H2 extrapolations are based 
on regressions of these two series on current and lagged changes in, respectively, crude 
oil prices and exchange rates.  This approach predicts that energy prices should decline at 
annual rates of about 6 percent in 2015:Q3 and 18 percent in 2015:Q4, while core import 
                                                 
36 This measure of core import prices is constructed by Board staff using published and unpublished data 
provided by the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Bureau of Labor Statistics .   
37 The information on participants’ forecasts provided at the September 17, 2015 , press conference is 
available on the Board ’s website at  
www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20150917.pdf .   - 30 - 
prices should fall about 2-1/2 percent at an annual rate in both quarters.38  Food prices are 
assumed to remain flat at their 2015:Q2 level; this assumption ensures that the combined 
contribution of food and energy prices to inflation in 2015 is consistent with the median 
difference between FOMC participants’ projections for total and core inflation.  Finally, 
nominal spending shares for food, energy, and core imports are assumed to remain 
unchanged at their 2015:Q2 levels, and long-run inflation expectations are assumed to 
remain constant at 2 percent.   
After computing historical 𝜖𝑡 tracking errors for the two equations of the model, 
the final step in the decomposition procedure is to run a sequence of counter -factual 
simulations of the model from 1990:Q1 through 2015:Q4.  One by one, each explanatory 
variable of the model is set to zero and the model is simulated; the resulting difference 
between actual inflation and its simulated value equals the historical contribution of that 
particular factor.  Importantly, the simulations are all dynamic in that the lagged inflation 
term in the core inflation equation is set equal to its simulated value in the preceding 
period, rather than its actual value.  As a result, the decompositions incorporate the 
effects of changes in lagged inflation that are attributable to previous movements in the 
explanatory variables. 
                                                 
38 The level of core import prices, expressed relative to core consumer prices, displayed a modest 
downward trend from 1990 through 2001  but since then has displayed little persistent trend, particularly if 
one controls for shifts related to recent changes in the real exchange rate.  If the post-2001 pattern persists 
in coming years, then 𝑅𝑃𝐼𝑀 𝑡 would be expected to converge to zero within a few quarters and core PCE 
inflation to converge to 2 percent within two or three years, assuming that the unemployment rate remains 
close to 5 percent (the CBO estimate of the natural rate) and there are no further shocks to the exchange 
rate and other factors.  If, however, core import prices were expected to resume trending down relative to 
consumer prices, then the model as specified would imply that the unemployment rate consistent with 
inflation stabilizing at 2 percent in the longer run would be somewhat lower than 5 percent. -202468101214

Monitoring the Financial System  
 
 
 
Remarks by  
 
Ben S. Bernanke  
 
Chairman  
 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  
 
at the  
 
49th Annual Conference on Bank Structure and Competition  
sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago

May 10 , 2013 
  
We are now more than four years beyond the most intense phase of the fin ancial 
crisis, but its legacy remains.  Our economy has not yet fully regained the jobs lost in the 
recession that accompanied the financial near  collapse.  And our financial system --
despite significant healing over the past four years --continues to strugg le with the 
economic, legal, and reputational consequences of the events of 2007 to 2009.   
The crisis also engendered major shifts in financial regulatory policy and practice.  
Not since the Great Depression have we seen such extensive changes in financia l 
regulation as those codified in the Dodd -Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer 
Protection Act ( Dodd -Frank Act ) in the United States and, internationally, in the Basel III 
Accord and a range of other initiatives.  This new regulatory framework is still under 
construction, but the Federal Reserve has already made significant changes to how it 
conceptualizes and carr ies out both its regulatory and supervisory role and its 
responsibility to foster financial stability.  
In my remarks today I will discuss the Federal Reserve’s efforts in an area that 
typically gets less attention than the writing and implementation of new  rules --namely, 
our ongoing monitoring of the financial system.  Of course, the Fed has always paid close 
attention to financial markets, for both regulatory and monetary  policy purposes.  
However,  in recent years, we have both greatly increased the resou rces we devote to 
monitoring and taken a more systematic and intensive approach, led by our Office of 
Financial Stability Policy and Research and drawing on substantial resources from across 
the Federal Reserve System.  This monitoring informs the policy d ecisions of both the 
Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Open Market Committee as well as our work  with 
other agencies.   - 2 - 
The step-up in our monitoring is motivated importantly by a shift in financial 
regulation and supervision toward a more macroprudentia l, or systemic , approach, 
supplementing our traditional microprudential perspective focused primarily on the 
health of individual institutions and markets.  In the spirit of this more systemic approach 
to oversight, the Dodd -Frank Act created the Financial  Stability Oversight Council 
(FSOC), which is comprised of the heads of a number of federal and state regulatory 
agencies.  The FSOC has fostered greater interaction among financial regulatory agencies 
as well as a sense of common responsibility for overal l financial stability.  Council 
members regularly discuss risks to financial stability and produce an annual report, which 
reviews potential risks and recommends ways to mitigate them.1  The Federal Reserve’s 
broad -based monitoring efforts have been essent ial for promoting a close and well -
informed collaboration with other FSOC members.  
A Focus on Vulnerabilities  
Ongoing monitoring of the financial system is vital to the macroprudential 
approach to regulation.  Systemic risks can only be defused if they are  first identified.  
That said, it is reasonable to ask whether systemic risks can in fact be reliably identified 
in advance; after all, neither the Federal Reserve nor economists in general predicted the 
past crisis.  To respond to this point, I w ill distinguish, as I have elsewhere, between 
triggers and vulnerabilities.2  The triggers  of any crisis are the particular events that touch

off the crisis --the proximate causes, if you will.  For the 2007 -09 crisis, a prominent 
trigger was the losses suffered by holders of subprime mortgages.  In contrast, the 
vulnerabilities  associated with a crisis are preexisting features of the financial system that 
amplify and propagate the initial shocks.   Examples of vulnerabilities include high  levels 
of leverage, maturity  transformation, interconnectedness, and complexity, all of which 
have the potential to magnify shocks to the financial system.  Absent vulnerabilities, 
triggers might produce sizable losses to certain firms, investors, or asset classes but 
would generally  not lead to full -blown financial crises; the collapse of the relatively small 
market for subprime mortgages, for example, would not have been nearly as 
consequential without preexisting fragilities in securitization practices and short -term 
funding market s which greatly increased its impact .  Of course, m onitoring can  and does  
attempt to identify potential triggers --indications of an asset bubble, for example --but 
shocks of one kind or another are inevitable, so identifying and addressing vulnerabilities 
is key to ensuring that the financial system overall is robust.   Moreover, attempts to 
address specific vulnerabilities can be supplemented by broader measures --such as 
requiring banks to hold more capital and liquidity --that make the system more resilient to 
a range of shocks.  
Two other related points motivate our increased monitoring.  The first is that the 
financial system is dynamic and evolving not only because of innovation and the 
changing needs of the economy, but also because financial activities te nd to migrate from 
more -regulated to less -regulated sectors.  An innovative feature of the Dodd -Frank Act is 
that it includes mechanisms to permit the regulatory system , at least in some 
circumstances,  to adapt to such changes .  For example , the act gives the FSOC  powers to  - 4 - 
designate systemically important institutions, market utilities, and activities for additional 
oversight.  Such designation is essentially a determination that an institution or activity 
creates or exacerbates a vulnerability of the fina ncial system, a determination that can 
only be made with comprehensive monitoring and analysis.  
The second motivation for more intensive monitoring is the apparent tendency for 
financial market participants to take greater risks when macro conditions are relatively 
stable.  Indeed, it may be that prolonged economic stability is a double -edged sword .  To 
be sure, a favorable overall environment reduces credit risk and strengthens balance 
sheets, all else being equal, but it could also reduce the incentives for market participants 
to take reasonable precautions, which may lead in turn to a buildup of fi nancial 
vulnerabilities.   Probably our best defense against complacency during extended periods 
of calm is careful monitoring for signs of emerging vulnerabilities and, where 
appropriate, the development of macroprudential and other  policy tools that can be used 
to address them . 
The Federal Reserve’s Financial Stability Monitoring Program  
So, what specifically does the Federal Reserve monitor?  In the remainder of my 
remarks, I’ll highlight and discuss four components of the financial system  that are 
among those we follow most closely:  systemically important financial institutions 
(SIFIs) , shadow banking , asset markets , and the nonfinancial sector.3 
                                                 
3 The remainder of my remarks draws heavily on Tobias Adrian, Daniel Covitz, and Nellie Liang (2013), 
“Financial Stability Monitoring,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2013 -21 (Washington:  Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System , April ), 
www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2013/201321/201321pap.pdf .  This paper provides more details on the 
Federal Reserve’s financial stability monitoring program .  I thank the authors for their assistance  with these 
remarks .  - 5 - 
Systemically Important Financial Institutions  
SIFIs are financial firms whose distress or fai lure has the potential to create 
broader financial instability sufficient to inflict meaningful damage on the real economy.  
SIFIs tend to be large, but size is not the only factor used to determin e whether a firm is 
systemically important ; other factors i nclude the firm’s interconnectedness with the rest 
of the financial system, the complexity and opacity of its operations, the nature and extent 
of its risk -taking, its use of leverage, its reliance on short -term wholesale funding, and the 
extent of its cro ss-border operations.  Under the Dodd -Frank Act, the largest bank 
holding companies are treated as SIFIs; in addition, as I mentioned, the act gives the 
FSOC the power to designate individual nonbank financial companies as systemically 
important.  This des ignation process is under way.  
Dodd -Frank also establishes a framework for subjecting SIFIs to comprehensive 
supervisory oversight and enhanced prudential standards.  For all such companies, the 
Federal Reserve will have access to confidential supervisory information and will 
monitor standard indicators such as regulatory capital, leverage, and funding mix.  
However, some of these measures, such as regulatory capital ratios, tend to be backward  
looking  and thus may be slow to flag unexpected , rapid changes in the condition of a 
firm.  Accordingly, we supplement the more  standard measures with other types of 
information.  
One valuable source of supplementary information is stress  testing.  Regular, 
comprehensive stress tests are an increasingly important compo nent of the Federal 
Reserve’s supervisory toolkit, having been used in our assessment of large bank holding  - 6 - 
companies since 2009.4  To administer a stress test, supervisors first construct a 
hypothetical scenario that assumes a set of highly adverse econom ic and financial 
developments --for example, a deep recession combined with sharp declines in the prices 
of houses and other assets.  The tested firms and their supervisors then independently 
estimate firms’ projected losses, revenues, and capital under the  hypothetical scenario, 
and the results are publicly disclosed.  Firms are evaluated both on their post-stress  
capital levels and on their ability to analyze their exposures and capital needs.  
Stress testing provides a number of advantages over more -standa rd approaches to 
assessing capital adequacy.  First, measures of capital based on stress tests are both more 
forward  looking and more robust to “tail risk” --that is, to extremely adverse 
developments of the sort most likely to foster broad -based financial instability.  Second, 
because the Federal Reserve conducts stress tests simultaneously on the major institutions 
it supervises, the results can be used both for comparative analyses across firms and to 
judge the collective susceptibility of major financial  institutions to certain types of 
shocks.   Indeed, comparative reviews of large financial institutions have become an 
increasingly important part of the Federal Reserve’s supervisory toolkit more generally.    
Third, the disclosure of stress -test results, which increased investor confidence during the 
crisis, can also strengthen market discipline in normal times.  The stress tests thus provide 
critical information about key financial institutions while also forcing the firms to 
improve their ability to meas ure and manage their risk exposures.  
                                                 
4 The Federal Reserve’s stress -testing program is discussed in Ben S. Bernanke (2013), “ Stres s Testing 
Banks :  What Have We Learned?” speech delivered at “Maintaining Financial Stability:  Holding a Tiger 
by the Tail,” a financial markets conference sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, held in 
Stone Mountain, Ga., April 8 -10, www.fede ralreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20130408a.htm.  
More limited forms of stress testing were used by supervisors before 2009 .   - 7 - 
Stress -testing techniques can also be used in more -focused assessments of the 
banking sector’s vulnerability to specific risks not captured in the main scenario, such as 
liquidity risk or interest rate risk.  Like compr ehensive stress tests, such focused exercises 
are an important element of our supervision of SIFIs.  For example, supervisors are 
collecting detailed data on liquidity that help them compare firms’ susceptibilities to 
various types of funding stresses and to evaluate firms’ strategies for managing their 
liquidity.  Supervisors also are working with firms to assess how profitability and capital 
would fare under various stressful interest  rate scenarios.  
Federal Reserve staff members supplement supervisory an d stress -test 
information with other measures.  For example, though supervisors have long appreciated 
the value of market -based indicators in evaluating the conditions of systemically 
important firms (or, indeed, any publicly traded firm), our monitoring p rogram uses 
market information to a much greater degree than in the past.  Thus, in addition to 
standard indicators --such as stock prices and the prices of credit default swaps, which 
capture market views about individual firms --we use market -based measure s of systemic 
stability derived from recent research.  These measures use correlations of asset prices to 
capture the market’s perception of a given firm’s potential to destabilize the financial 
system at a time when the broader financial markets are stres sed; other measures estimate 
the vulnerability of a given firm to disturbances emanating from elsewhere in the 
system.5  The further development of market -based measures of systemic vulnerabilities 
and systemic risk is a lively area of research.  
                                                 
5 For example, c onditional value at risk provides an estimate of the systemic importance of a firm at a 
moment in time, bas ed on how the firm’s equity value and broader equity values co -vary when overall 
conditions are very adverse; see Tobias Adrian and Markus K. Brunnermeier ( 2008 ; revised September 
2011), “CoVaR,” Staff Reports 348 (New York:  Federal Reserve Bank of New Yo rk, September),  - 8 - 
Network an alysis , yet another promising tool under active development, has the 
potential to help us better monitor the interconnectedness of financial institutions and 
markets.  Interconnectedness can arise from common holdings of assets or through the 
exposures of firms to their counterparties.  Network measures rely on concepts used in 
engineering, communications, and neuroscience to map linkages among financial firms 
and market activities.  The goals are to identify key nodes or clusters that could 
destabilize the  system and to simulate how a shock, such as the sudden distress of a firm, 
could be transmitted and amplified through the network.  These tools can also be used to 
analyze the systemic stability effects of a change in the structure of a network.  For 
exam ple, margin rules affect the sensitivity of firms to the conditions of their 
counterparties; thus, margin rules affect the likelihood of financial contagion through 
various firms and markets.  
Shadow Banking  
Shadow banking, a second area we closely monitor,  was an important source of 
instability during the crisis.  Shadow banking comprises various markets and institutions 
that provide financial intermediation outside the traditional, regulated banking system.  
Shadow banking includes vehicles for credit inte rmediation, maturity transformation, 
liquidity provision, and risk sharing .  Such vehicles are typically funded on a largely 
short -term basis from wholesale sources.  In the run -up to the crisis, the shadow banking 
                                                                                                                                                 
www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr348.pdf.  The distressed insurance premium uses information 
from firms’ credit default swap  spreads and equity prices to measure the implied cost of insuring a given 
firm against broader financial  distress --an indicator of the vulnerability of the firm to systemic instability; 
see Xin Huang, Hao Zhou, and Haibin Zhu (2009), “A Framework for Assessing the Systemic Risk of 
Major Financial Institutions,” Journal of Banking and Finance , vol. 33 (Novemb er), pp.  2036 -49.  The 
systemic expected shortfall uses firm equity prices, leverage, and volatility to measure the propensity of a 
firm to be undercapitalized given a marketwide decline in equity prices; see Viral V. Acharya, Lasse H. 
Pedersen, Thomas Phi lippon, and Matt hew Richardson (2010) , “Measuring System ic Risk,” unpublished 
paper, New York University, Leonard Stern School of Business, May, 
http://vlab.stern.nyu.edu/public/static/SR -v3.pdf .  - 9 - 
sector involved a high degree of maturity  transformation and leverage.  Illiquid loans to 
households and businesses were securitized, and the tranches of the securitizations with 
the highest credit ratings were funded by very short -term debt, such as asset -backed 
commercial paper and repurchase a greements (repos).  The short -term funding was in 
turn provided by institutions, such as money market funds, whose investors expected 
payment in full on demand and had little tolerance for risk to principal.   
As it turned out, the ultimate investors did n ot fully understand the quality of the 
assets they were financing.  Investors were lulled by triple -A credit ratings and by 
expected support from sponsoring institutions --support that was , in fact , discretionary and 
not always provided.  When investors los t confidence in the quality of the assets or in the 
institutions expected to provide support, they ran.  Their flight created serious funding 
pressures throughout the financial system, threatened the solvency of many firms, and 
inflicted serious damage on the broader economy.  
Securities broker -dealers play a central role in many aspects of shadow banking as 
facilitators of market -based intermediation.  To finance their own and their clients’ 
securities holdings, broker -dealers tend to rely on short -term col lateralized funding, often 
in the form of repo agreements with highly risk -averse lenders.  The crisis revealed that 
this funding is potentially quite fragile if lenders have limited capacity to analyze the 
collateral or counterparty risks associated with short -term secured lending, but rather look 
at these transactions as nearly risk free.  As questions emerged about the nature and value 
of collateral, worried lenders either greatly increased margin requirements or, more 
commonly, pulled back entirely.  Bo rrowers unable to meet margin calls and finance their  - 10 - 
asset holdings were forced to sell, driving down asset prices further and setting off a 
cycle of deleveraging and further asset liquidation.   
To monitor intermediation by broker -dealers, the Federal Res erve in 2010 created 
a quarterly Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey  on Dealer Financing Terms , which asks 
dealers about the credit they provide.6  Modeled on the long -established Senior Loan 
Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices sent to commer cial banks, the survey 
of senior credit officers at dealers tracks conditions in markets such as those for securities 
financing, prime brokerage, and derivatives trading.7  The credit officer survey is 
designed to monitor potential vulnerabilities stemming  from the greater use of leverage 
by investors (particularly through lending backed by less -liquid collateral) or increased 
volumes of maturity transformation.  Before the financial crisis, we had only very limited 
information regarding such trends.   
We h ave other potential sources of information about shadow banking.  The 
Treasury  Department ’s Office of Financial Research  and Federal Reserve staff are 
collaborating  to construct data sets on triparty and bilateral repo transactions, which 
should facilitate  the development of better monitoring metrics for repo activity and 
improve transparency in these markets.  We also talk regularly to market participants 
about developments, paying particular attention to the creation of new financial vehicles 
that foster greater maturity transformation outside the regulated sector, provide funding 
for less -liquid assets, or transform risks from forms that are more easily measured to 
forms that are more opaque.

Board’s website at www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/releases/scoos.htm.  
7 The Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices is available on the Federal Reserve 
Board’s website at www.federalrese rve.gov/boarddocs/SnLoanSurvey/default.htm.   - 11 - 
A fair summary is that, while the shadow banking sector is smal ler today than 
before the crisis and some of its least stable components have either disappeared or been 
reformed, regulators and the private sector need to address remaining vulnerabilities.  For 
example, although money market funds were strengthened by r eforms undertaken by the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2010, the possibility of a run on these 
funds remains --for instance, if a fund should “break the buck,” or report a net asset value 
below 99.5 cents, as the Reserve Primary Fund did in 20 08.  The risk is increased by the 
fact that the Treasury no longer has the power to guarantee investors’ holdings in money 
funds, an authority that was critical for stopping the 2008 run.  In November 2012, the 
FSOC  proposed for public comment some  alterna tive approaches for the reform of 
money funds.   The SEC is currently considering these and other possible steps.  
With respect to the triparty repo platform, progress has been made in reducing the 
amount of intraday credit extended by the clearing banks in the course of the daily 
settlement process , and, as additional enhancements are made , the extension of such 
credit should be largely eliminated by the end of 2014 .  However, important risks remain 
in the short -term wholesale funding markets.  One of the key risks is how the system 
would respond to the failure of a broker -dealer or other major borrower.  The Dodd -
Frank Act has provided important additional tools to deal with this vulnerability, notably 
the provisions that facilitate an orderly resolution of a broker -dealer or a broker -dealer 
holding company whose imminent failure poses a systemic risk.  But, as highlighted in 
the FSOC’s most recent annual report, mor e work is needed to better prepare investors  - 12 - 
and other market participants to deal with the potential consequences of a default by a 
large participant in the repo market.8   
Asset Markets  
Asset markets are a third area that we closely monitor.  We follow d evelopments 
in markets for a wide range of assets, including public and private fixed -income 
instruments, corporate equities, real estate, commodities, and structured credit products, 
among others.  Foreign as well as domestic markets receive close attenti on, as do global 
linkages, such as the effects of the ongoing European fiscal and banking problems on 
U.S. markets.  
 Not surprisingly, we try to identify unusual patterns in valuations, such as 
historically high or low ratios of prices to earnings in equit y markets.  We use a variety of 
models and methods; for example, we use empirical models of default risk and risk 
premiums to analyze credit spreads in corporate bond markets.  These assessments are 
complemented by other information, including measures of volumes, liquidity, and 
market functioning, as well as intelligence gleaned from market participants and outside 
analysts.  In light of the current low  interest  rate environment, we are watching 
particularly closely for instances of “reaching for yield” an d other forms of excessive 
risk-taking , which may affect asset prices and their relationships with fundamentals.  It is 
worth emphasizing that looking for historically unusual patterns or relationships in asset 
prices can be useful even if you believe that  asset markets are generally efficient in 
setting prices.  For the purpose of safeguarding financial stability, we are less concerned 
about whether a given asset price is justified in some average sense than in the possibility 
                                                 
8 See Financial Stability Oversight Council , 2013 Annual Report , in note 1 .   - 13 - 
of a sharp move.  Asset price s that are far from historically normal levels would seem to 
be more susceptible to such destabilizing moves.  
From a financial stability perspective, however, the assessment of asset valuations 
is only the first step of the analysis.  Also to be considered  are factors such as the 
leverage and degree of maturity mismatch being used by the holders of the asset, the 
liquidity of the asset , and the sensitivity of the asset’s value to changes in broad financial 
conditions.  Differences in these factors help expl ain why the correction in equity markets 
in 2000 and 2001 did not induce widespread systemic disruptions, while the collapse in 
house prices and in the quality of mortgage credit during the 2007 -09 crisis had much 
more far -reaching effects:  The losses fro m the stock market declines in 2000 and 2001 
were widely diffused, while mortgage losses were concentrated --and, through various 
financial instruments, amplified --in critical parts of the financial system, resulting 
ultimately in panic, asset fire sales, a nd the collapse of credit markets.  
Nonfinancial Sector  
Our financial stability monitoring extends to the nonfinancial sector, including 
households and businesses.  Research has identified excessive growth in credit and 
leverage in the private nonfinancial sector as potential indicators of systemic risk.9  
Highly leveraged or financially fragile households and businesses are less able to 
withstand adverse changes in income or wealth, including those brought about by 
deteriorating conditions in financial and credit markets.  A highly leveraged economy is 
also more prone to so -called financial accelerator effects , as when financially stressed 
                                                 
9 See, for example, Mathias Drehmann, Claudio Borio, and Kostas Tsatsaronis (2011), “Anchoring 
Countercyclical Capital Buffers:  The Role of Credit Aggregates,” International Journal of Central 
Banking , vol. 7 (December), pp. 189 -240; and Rochelle M. Edge and Ralf R. Meisenzahl (2011), “The 
Unreliability of Credit -to-GDP Ratio Gaps in Rea l Time:  Implications for Countercyclical Capital 
Buffers,” International Journal of Central Banking , vol. 7 (December), pp. 261 -98.  - 14 - 
firms are forced to lay off workers who , in turn, lacking financial reserves, sharply cut 
their own spending.  Financial  stress in the nonfinancial sector --for example, higher 
default rates on mortgages or corporate debt --can also damage financial institutions, 
creating a potential adverse feedback loop as they reduce the availability of credit and 
shed assets to conserve c apital, thereby further weakening the financial positions of 
households and firms.  
The vulnerabilities of the nonfinancial sector can potentially be captured by both 
stock measures (such as wealth and leverage) and flow measures (such as the ratio of 
debt service to income).  Sector -wide  data are available from a number of sources, 
importantly the Federal Reserve’s flow of funds accounts, which is a set of aggregate 
integrated financial accounts that measures sources and uses of funds for major sectors as 
well as for the economy as a whole.10  These accounts allow us to trace the flow of credit 
from its sources, such as banks or wholesale funding markets, to the household and 
business sectors that receive it.   
The Federal Reserve also now monitors detailed c onsumer - and business -level 
data suited for picking up changes in the nature of borrowing and lending , as well as for 
tracking financial conditions of those most exposed to a cyclical downturn or a reversal 
of fortunes.  For example, during the housing boo m, the aggregate data accurately 
showed the outsized pace of home mortgage  borrowing, but it could not reveal the 
pervasive deterioration in underwriting that implied a substantial increase in the 
underlying credit risk from that activity.11  More recently,  gains in household net worth

have been concentrated among wealthier households, while many households in the 
middle or lower parts of the distribution have experienced declines in wealth since the 
crisis.  Moreover, many homeowners remain “underwater,” wi th their homes worth less 
than the principal balances on their mortgages.  Thus, more detailed information clarifies 
that many households remain more financially fragile than might be inferred from the 
aggregate statistics alone.  
Conclusion  
 In closing, let me reiterate that while the effective regulation and supervision of 
individual financial institutions will always be crucial to ensuring a well -functioning 
financial system, the Federal Reserve is moving toward a more systemic approach that  
also pays close attention to the vulnerabilities of the financial system as a whole.  Toward 
that end, we are pursuing an active program of financial monitoring, supported by 
expanded research and data collection, often undertaken in conjunction with othe r U.S. 
financial regulatory agencies .  Our stepped -up monitoring and analysis is already 
providing important information for the Board and the Federal Open Market Committee 
as well as for the broader regulatory community.  We will continue to work to ward  
improv ing our ability to detect and address vulnerabilities in  our financial system.

August 25 , 2023 
  
 Good mornin g.  At last year’s Jackson Hole symposium, I delivered a brief, direct 
message.  M y remarks this year will be  a bit longer , but the message is the same:  It is the 
Fed’s job to  bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal , and we will do so.   We have 
tightened policy significantly over the past year .  Although inflation has moved down 
from its peak —a welcome development —it remains too high.  We are prepared to raise 
rates further if appropriate, and intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we are 
confident that inflation is moving sustainably down toward our obj ective.    
Today I will review our progress so far and discuss the outlook and the 
uncertainties we face as we pursue  our dual mandate goals.  I will conclude with a 
summary of what this means for policy.   Given how far we have come, at upcoming 
meetings we are in a position to proceed carefully as we assess the incoming data and the 
evolving outlook and risks . 
The Decline in Inflation So Far 
The ongoing episode of high inflation initially emerged  from a collision between 
very strong demand  and pandemic -constrained supply.  By the time the Federal Open 
Market Committee raised the policy rate in March 2022, i t was clear that bringing down 
inflation would depend on both the unwinding of  the unprecede nted pandemic -related 
demand and supply distortions  and on our tightening of monetary policy , which would 
slow the growth of aggregate demand, allowing  supply time to catch up.   While these two 
forces are now working together to bring down inflation, the p rocess still has a long way 
to go, even with the more favorable recent readings.  
On a 12 -month basis, U.S. total, or “headline,” PCE (personal consumption 
expenditures) inflation peaked at 7 percent in June 2022 and declined to 3. 3 percent  as of  
 - 2 - 
July, fol lowing a trajectory roughly  in line with global trends (figure 1, panel A ).1  The 
effects of Russia’s war against  Ukraine  have been a primary driver of the changes in 
headline inflation around the world since early 2022 .  Headline inflation is what 
househ olds and businesses  experience  most directly, so this decline is very good news.  
But food and energy prices are influenced by global factors that remain volatile, and can 
provide a misleading signal  of where inflation is headed .  In my remaining comments,  I 
will focus on core PCE inflation, which omits the food and energy components.  
On a 12 -month basis, core PCE inflation peaked at 5.4 percent in February 2022 
and declined gradually to 4.3 percent in July  (figure 1, panel B) .  The lower monthly 
readings for core inflation in June and July were welcome, but two months of good data 
are only the beginning of what it will take to build confidence that inflation is moving 
down sustainably toward our goal.   We can’t yet  know the extent to which these lower 
readings will continue or where underlying inflation will settle over coming quarters.  
Twelve -month core inflation is still elevated , and there is  substantial further ground to 
cover to get back to price stability.  
To understand the factors that will likely d rive further progress, it is useful to 
separately examine the three broad components of core PCE inflation —inflation for 
goods, for housing services, and for all other  services, sometimes referred to as 
nonhousing services (figure 2).  
Core goods inflation  has fallen sharply , particularly for durable goods , as both 
tighter monetary policy and the slow unwinding of supply  and demand dislocations are

information, including the July 2023 consumer price index and producer price index data.   The July 2023 
PCE inflation data will b e published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis on  August 31, 2023.

bringing it down.  The motor vehicle sector provides a good illustration .  Earlier in the 
pandemic, demand for  vehicles rose sharply, supported by low interest rates, fiscal 
transfers, curtailed spending on in -person services, and shifts in preference away from 
using public transportation and from living in cities.  But because of a shortage of 
semiconductors, vehicle supply actually fell.  Vehicle prices spiked, and a large pool of 
pent-up demand emerged.  As the pandemic and its effects have waned, production  and 
inventories  have grown, and supply has improved .  At the same time, higher interest rates 
have weigh ed on demand .  Interest rates on auto loans have nearly doubled  since early 
last year , and customers report feeling the effect of higher rates on affordability.2  On net, 
motor vehicle inflation has declined sharply because of the combined effects of these 
supply and demand factors.    
Similar dynamics are playing out for core goods inflation overall.  As they do, the 
effects of monetary restraint should show through more fu lly over time.  Core goods 
prices fell the past two months, but on a 12 -month basis, core goods inflation remains 
well above its pre -pandemic level.  Sustained progress is needed, and restrictive monetary 
policy is called for to achieve that progress.     
In the highly interest -sensitive housing sector, the effects of monetary policy 
became apparent soon after liftoff.  Mortgage rates doubled over the course of 2022, 
causing housing starts and sales to fall and house price growth to plummet.  Growth in 
mark et rents soon peaked and  then steadily declined  (figure 3) .3   
 
2 For example, 25 percent of respondents to the most recent University of Michigan Survey s of Consumers 
reported that it is currently a bad time to buy a new vehicle because of higher interest rates and tighter 
credit conditions, up from  only 4 percent  of respondents  in 2021.   For more information, see the 
preliminary results of the August 2023 survey, available on the University of Michigan’s website at 
http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu .   
3 This slowing in rent growth has likely occurred for a combination of reason s.  Some of it likely reflects 
higher interest rates and the softening in real household income grow th over the past couple of years .  But   
 - 4 - 
Measured housing services inflation lagged these changes , as is typical, but has 
recently begun to fall.  This inflation metric reflects rents paid by all tenants, as well as 
estimates of the equivalent rents that could be earned from homes that are owner  
occupied.4  Because leases turn over slowly, it takes time for a decline in market rent 
growth to work its way into the overall inflation measure .  The market rent slowdown has 
only recently begun to show through to that measure.   The slowing growth in rents for 
new leases over roughly the past year can be thought of as “in the pipeline” and will 
affect measured housing services inflation over the coming year.  Going forward, if 
market rent gr owth settles near pre -pandemic levels, housing services inflation should 
decline toward its pre -pandemic level  as well .  We will continue to watch the market  rent 
data closely for a signal of the upside and downside risks to housing services inflation.           
The final category, nonhousing services, accounts for over half of the core PCE 
index and includes a broad range of services, such as health care, food services, 
transportation, and accommodations.  Twelve -month inflation  in this sector has moved 
sideways since liftoff.  Inflation measured over the past three and six months has 
declined, however, which is encouraging.  Part of the reason for the modest decline of 
nonhousing services inflation so far is that many of these services were less affected b y 
 
the normalization of dislocations due to the pandemic is likely playing a role here as well.  For example, the 
shifts in housing preferences  related to working from home  likely contributed to the increase in housing 
demand reflected in the sizable earlier increases in rents.   As the price effects of that demand shift played 
out, the growth rate of rents would naturally decline toward its earlier trend.  Finally , multifamily 
construction is quite high by historical stan dards , and that supply coming on  line has likely also taken some 
pressure off  market  rents.  
4 PCE prices for housing services include both the rents paid by tenants and an imputed rental value for 
owner -occupied dwellings (measured as the income the homeow ner could have received if the house had 
been rented to a tenant).  For additional details, see Bureau of Economic Analysis (2022), “Rental Income 
of Persons,” in NIPA Handbook:  Concepts and Methods of the U.S. National Income and Product 
Accounts  (Washin gton:  BEA, December), pp. 12 -1–12-15,

global supply  chain bottlenecks and are generally thought to be  less interest  sensitive than 
other sectors such as  housing or durable goods.  Production of these services is also 
relatively labor  intensive , and the labor market remains tight.  Given the size of this 
sector, some further progress here will be essential to restoring price stability.  Over time, 
restrictive monetary policy will help bring aggregate supply and demand back into better 
balance, r educing inflationary pressures in this key sector.   
The Outlook  
Turning to  the outlook, although further unwinding of pandemic -related 
distortions should continue to put some downward pressure on inflation, restrictive 
monetary policy will likely play an increasingly important role.  Getting inflation 
sustainably back down to 2 percent is expected to require a period of below -trend 
economic growth as well as some softening in labor market conditions.    
Economic growth      
Restrictive monetary policy has tightened financial conditions , supporting the 
expectation of below -trend g rowth .5  Since  last year’s  symposium, the two -year real yield 
is up about 250 basis points, and longer -term real yields are higher  as well —by nearly 
150 basis points.6  Beyond changes in interest rates, b ank lending standards have 
tightened, and loan gro wth has slowed sharply.7  Such a tightening of broad financial

Board staff’s new index measuring U.S. financial conditions through their effect on the outlook for growth ; 
the index is discussed in  Andrea Ajello, Michele Cavallo, Giovanni Favara, William B. Peterman, John W. 
Schindler  IV, and Nitish R. Sinha (2023) , “A New Index to Measure U.S. Financial Conditions, ” FEDS

6 Changes in real yield s cited in this sentence refer to changes in yields on 2 - and 10 -year Treasury 
Inflation -Protected Securiti es. 
7 In addition, as the policy rate increased, nonbanking lending conditions changed as well.  For example, 
beginning in 2022 and continuing into the first half of this year , net issuance of riskier debt —such as 
leveraged loans and speculative -grade and unrated corporate bonds —in public credit markets declined .    
 - 6 - 
conditions typically contribute s to a slowing in the growth of economic activity, and there 
is evidence of that  in this cycle as well.  For example, growth in industrial production has 
slowed, and the amount spent on residential investment has declined in each of the past 
five quarters (figure  4). 
But we are attentive to signs that the economy may not be cooling as expected .  
So far this year, GDP (gross domesti c product ) growth  has come in above expectations 
and above its longer -run trend, and recent readings on consumer spending have been 
especially robust.  In addition, after decelerating sharply over the past 18 months, the 
housing sector  is showing signs of picking back up.  Additional evidence of persistently 
above -trend growth could  put further progress on inflation at risk and could warrant 
further tightening  of monetary policy .  
The l abor market    
The rebalancing of the labor market has continued over th e past year but remains 
incomplete.  Labor supply has improved, driven by stronger participation among workers 
aged 25 to 54 and by an increase in immigration back toward pre -pandemic levels.  
Indeed, the labor force participation rate of women in their pr ime working years reached 
an all -time high in June.  Demand for labor has moderated as well.   Job openings remain 
high but are trending lower .  Payroll j ob growth has slowed significantly .  Total hours 
worked has been flat over the past six months , and the  average workweek has declined to 
the lower end of its pre -pandemic range, reflecting a gradual normalization in labor 
market conditions  (figure 5) .        
This rebalancing has eased wage pressures.  W age growth across a range of 
measures continues to slow , albeit gradually (figure 6).  While nominal wage growth  
 - 7 - 
must ultimately slow to a rate that is consistent with 2 percent inflation, what matters for 
households is real wage growth.  Even as nominal wage growth has slowed, real wage 
growth has been increa sing as inflation has fallen.   
We expect this labor market rebalancing to continue.  Evidence  that the tightness  
in the labor market  is no longer easing could also call for a monetary  policy response .     
Uncertainty and Risk Management along the Path Forward  
Two percent is and will remain our inflation target.  W e are committed to 
achieving and sustaining a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to 
bring inflation down to that level  over time .  It is challen ging, of course, to know in real 
time when such a stance has been achieved.  There are some challenges that are common 
to all tightening cycles.  For example, real interest rates are now positive and well above 
mainstream estimates of the neutral policy ra te.  We see the current stance of policy as 
restrictive, putting  downward pressure on economic activity, hiring, and inflation.  But 
we cannot identify with certainty the neutral rate of interest, and thus there is always 
uncertainty about the precise level of monetary policy restraint .   
That assessment is further com plicated by uncertainty about the duration of the 
lags with which monetary tightening affects economic activity and especially inflation.  
Since the symposium a year ago, the Committee has raised the policy rate by 300 basis 
points , including 100 basis poi nts over the past seven months .  And we have  substantially 
reduced the size of our securities holdings .  The wide range of estimates of these lags 
suggests that there may be signif icant further drag in the pipeline .   
Beyond these traditional sources of po licy uncertainty , the supply and demand 
dislocations unique to this cycle raise further complications through their effects on  
 - 8 - 
inflation and labor market dynamics.  For example, so far, j ob openings have declined 
substantially without increasing  unemployme nt—a highly welcome but historically 
unusual result that appears to reflect large excess demand for labor.  In addition, there is 
evidence that inflation has become  more responsive to labor market tightness than was 
the case in  recent  decades .8  These cha nging dynamics may or may not persist, and this 
uncertainty underscores the need for agile policymaking.   
These uncertainties, both old and new, complicate our task of balancing the risk 
of tightening  monetary policy  too much against  the risk of tightenin g too little.   Doing too 
little could allow above -target inflation to become entrenched and ultimately require 
monetary policy to wring more persistent inflation from the economy at a high cost to 
employment.  Doing too much could also do unnecessary harm to the economy.   
Conclusion  
As is often the case, we are navigating by the stars under cloudy skies.  In such 
circumstances, risk -management considerations are critical.  At upcoming meeting s, we 
will assess our progress based on the totality of the data and the evolving outlook and 
risks.  Based on this assessment, we will proceed carefully as we decide whether to 
tighten further or, instead, to hold the policy rate constant and await further  data.  
 
8 The relationship between labor market slack and inflation, often called  the Phillips curve relationship, is 
likely nonlinear, steepening in a tight labor market.  If the Phillips curve has steepened in this way, a small 
change in labor market tightness could result in a more substantial change in inflation.  It is difficult to 
know with precision how steep that relationship is in real time  or how it might evolve as labor market 
tightness changes.  For more information on nonlinearities in this relationship, see Christoph E. Boehm and

Restoring price stability is essential to achieving both sides of our dual mandate.  We will 
need price stability to achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that 
benefit all.   
We will keep at it until the job is done.

A Teacher Town Hall Meeting: 10 0 Years of the Federal Reserve  
 
Washington, D.C.

November 13, 2013  
  
Thank you for that introduction .  Tonight marks the third time in just a little over 
three years that the Federal Reserve System has hosted a  teacher town hall , and I am very 
pleased to  have this opportunity  to speak with educators, both those of you here in 
Washington, D.C., and those watching at Reserve Bank gatherings  around the country.  I 
look forward to your questions  in a few moments.  B ut let me begin by briefly discussing 
an important milestone for the Federal Reserve --its centennial --and the opportunity that 
this occasion affords to teach and learn about the Fed’s origins, history, and role, and 
about how this inst itution has helped shape the nation’s economy and financial system.   
President Woodrow Wilson signed the Federal Reserve Act, which established the 
Federal Reserve System, on December 23, 1913.  As the 100th anniversary of that event approaches, we have s everal reasons to look back at an eventful century.  One important 
reason is to better understand what historical experience can teach us about how best to 
respond to current challenges.  For example, as many of you know, the bold measures the Fed took in response to the recent financial crisis reflected in part its determination to avoid repeating the sorts of mistakes it made before and during the Great Depression  of 
the 1930s.  Similarly, our commitment to safeguarding price stability is reinforced by memories of the costs of high inflation during the 1970s and the  Federal Reserve’s 
subsequent restoration of price stability  under Chairman Volcker  during  the 1980s.   
Beyond the insights that the study of the Federal Reserve’s first 100 years  offer to 
econo mists, historians, and policymakers about  how the Fed can best meet its objectives 
today and in the future , a second reason to mark the centennial is  the opportunity it 
affords  to educate young people  about the Federal Reserve and its  important role in 
promoting a healthy economy and stabl e financial system.  When I was an educator , I  - 2 - 
quickly came to understand that students are most motivated to learn when they can see 
the connection of the lesson to their own lives.  T he Fed and its activities, and econom ics 
in general, can seem remote from daily concerns.  B ut as teachers, you can show students 
how the Fed eral Reserve’s decisions  concretely affect them and their families.  The Fed’s 
actions influence the overall strength and s tability of the economy, as y ou know, but they 
also affect the cost of a mortgage,  the prices of goods and services , and the health of the 
job market that your students are part of or will soon be entering . 
Economics also complements and enriches the study of history.  When I took 
history classes in high school, we spent much of our time memorizing dates and 
important events --revolutions, wars, elections, the passage of laws,  and so on.  While I 
appreciated the need to be familiar with such milestones, I remember feeling that I would like to know more about the lives of ordinary people at those times, not just about kings 
and queens and presidents.  In college and graduate school , I studied economic history 
and found what I was looking for.  For me, economic history added critical conte xt by 
zooming in on the conditions of ordinary life --how people earned their livings, what their 
wages would buy, the extent to which they felt economically secure, the pace of economic change that they faced.  Appreciating what the lives of ordinary peopl e were 
like at various times and places helped explain the larger events --the wars , revolutions , 
and elections --as well.   
By the same token, understanding  history also requires an appreciation of the role 
of key economic institutions, including central banks like the Federal Reserve.  When I was in graduate school, my teacher, Stanley Fischer, introduced me to the work of Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz, w hich demonstrated that monetary policy can have  - 3 - 
enormous effects on how the economy performs, for good or for ill.  That realization 
helped motivate me to specialize, in graduate school and after, in monetary economics and related fields.  Similarly, for y our students, it’s impossible to understand the Great 
Depression, America’s strong economic performance after World War II, or the recent financial crisis without learning about the Federal Reserve and the debates that have surrounded it.  
Learning about the Federal Reserve and about economics more generally will 
help students in their daily lives, by helping them make better financial or career decisions, for example, and by helping them become more informed citizens and voters.  Learning about the Federal Reserve and its economic context will also give students a deeper understanding of history, as I noted.  Yet there is one more reason why we at the Fed hope to use this centennial as an educational opportunity --to maintain and strengthen 
the democratic accountability and effectiveness of this institution.  
Traditionally, like other central banks, the Fed was reluctant to explain its policy  
decisions or otherwise engage with the public, partly based on a belief that this approach increased the effectiveness o f monetary policy.  However, t his lack of openness became 
increasingly out of step with other institutions in our democratic society ; it also reduced 
the effectiveness of Fed policies by inhibiting public understanding and discussion of policy goals and st rategies.  This approach began to change in the 1990s, when the 
Federal Reserve began to regularly provide more information about how it saw the economic situation and how it would respond.  Increasing the Fed’s transparency, openness, and accountability h as been one of my top priorities as Chairman.  A more 
open Fed, in my view, is both a more effective and more democratically legitimate  - 4 - 
institution.  Indeed, the  complex challenges  we face as a nation are best addressed  in an 
environment of informed public  discourse, which is only possible when policy decisions 
are made in as transparent a way as possible.  The centennial may be just an accident of 
the calendar, but any time is a good time to help more people learn about the Fed and what it does to enhance the economic well -being of Americans.  
It is often said --alas , accurately --that teaching is a thankless profession, so let me 
close by thanking you for what you give to your students.  Our country and our economy need informed citizens who can think independently and critically.  More pertinent to today’s meeting, let me also thank you for your interest in teaching your students about the history and role of the Federal Reserve.  As many of you have discovered, the  Federal 
Reserve has a variety of  classroom tools available through our education portal, 
FederalReserveEducation.org .  Notably, the System’s economic and financial  education 
staff is introducing today a set of three lesson plans that examine  the past 100 years of 
central banking.  I hope they will  provide practical help in your classes.  
Thank you for participating  in today ’s event .  I look forward to your questions 
and to an interesting discussion of  the Federal Reserve’s past, present, and future.  ",2013-11-13,bernanke

Thank you, President Mester and Treye  Johnson , and thanks to everyone for 
joining us .  My job today is to listen, so I will keep my remarks short .  But I do want to 
say that these conversations are incredibly valuable .  They give context to reams of data 
and definition to a huge and complex economic picture .  They also help solve problems 
on a practical level.  Feedback from our Investing in America’s Workforc e initiative 
found a pronounced need for workforce and economic development programs to more 
closely align, for instance .  And employers’ input has influenced work across the Fed 
System, including the Cleveland Fed, as they look at how skills on the lower end of the pay scale can transfer to higher -earning jobs .  So from me, and on behalf of my 
colleagues:  Thank you for your time today and for your ongoing insight .   
It is not lost on me that we are meeting on Juneteenth amid a renewed reckoning 
of racial injustice .  The pandemic has again exposed a range of troubling inequalities, 
most of them of long standing.  As the national discussion continues, it is critical to 
remember that equity includes access to education, work, and economic opportunity.  I 
am reminded that Dr . King delivered his “I Have a Dream” speech, just a few short 
blocks from the Federal Reserve, at a rally whose full title was the March on Washington 
for Jobs and Freedom.  
We meet today amid the immense hardship and suffering the coronavi rus has 
caused .  Lives and livelihoods have been lost , and uncertainty looms large .  We are all 
grateful to our frontline health -care workers who put themselves in harm’s way every day  
and to the essential workers helping us meet our needs .  While we are a ll affected, the 
burden has fallen disproportionately on those least able to bear it.   - 2 - 
Before the virus swept across the globe, the American economy was in a good 
place.  We were experiencing the longest expansion on record, and unemployment had 
reached historic lows.   However, that is a national average that can gloss over stark 
realities.  That economic good fortune had eluded pockets across the country, including Youngstown.  A particular cruelty of the pandemic has been its disproportionate effect s 
on many areas that were already suffering .   
We will make our way back from this, but it will take time and work.  Some of 
the most valuable information we get from these discussions is how people are working to create growth .  Your feedback can be an invalua ble example for other communities 
with similar challenges .  The Lordstown closure served as a reminder of how 
interconnected local economies can be, and other areas have experienced similar losses.  Your work on diversifying the economy, on skills developm ent, on small business 
support programs, and in so many other areas can all serve as models for others to 
replicate.  
The path ahead is likely to be challenging.  But given the opportunity, I’ll always 
bet on the American people and on the kind of community resolve and dedication we’re hearing about today.  I’m looking forward to your insight and to hearing more about how 
you’ve been working to revitalize Youngstown’s economy.  
Thank you. ",2020-06-19,powell

I commend the organizers of this conference for the event’s apt subtitle:  “The 
Devil’s in the Details.”   For the Federal Reserve and other financial regulators, g etting 
the details right is crucial as we implement the Dodd -Frank Wall Street Reform and 
Consumer Protection Act (Dodd -Frank Act ) and strive to meet our broader financial 
stability responsibilities .  About three  and a half years have passed since the darkest days 
of the financial crisis, but our economy is still far from having fully recovered from its 
effects.  The heavy human and economic costs of the crisis undersco re the importance of 
taking all  necessary steps to avoid a repeat of the  events of the  past few years.  
Tonight I will discuss some ways in which the Federal Reserve, since the crisis, 
has reoriented itself from being  (in its financial regulatory capacity) primarily a 
supervisor  of a specific set of financial institutions  toward  being an agency with a broader 
focus on systemic stability  as well .  I will highlight some of the ways we and other 
agencies are working  to incre ase the resiliency  of systemically important financial firms 
and identify and mitigat e systemic risks , including those associated  with the so-called  
shadow banking system.  I will also discuss the broad outlines of our evolving approach 
to monitoring finan cial stability.   Our efforts are a work in progress , and we are learning 
as we go .  But I hope to convey a sense of the strong commitment of the Federal Reserve  
to foster ing a more stable and resilient financial system . 
Systemically Important Financial Firms  
Banking Institutions  
Since the crisis, t he Federal Reserve has made important strides in the traditional, 
microprudential regulation and supervision of individual banking organizations .  
Promoting the safety and soundness of individual financial firm s is a critical   - 2 -  
 
 
 responsibility.  To an increasing extent, however, we have  also been  working to embed 
our supervis ory practices  within a broader macroprudential framework that focuses  not 
only on the conditions of individual firms but also  on the health of  the financial system as 
a whole.   
Even before the enactment of the Dodd -Frank Act, we had begun to overhaul our 
approach to supervision  to better achieve both microprudential and macroprudential 
goals.  In 2009 , we created  the Large Institution Supervisi on Coordinating Committee --a 
high-level, multidisciplinary working group, drawing on skills and experience  from 
throughout the Federal Reserve System --and charged it with overseeing  the supervision 
of the most system ically important financial  firms.  Throu gh the coordinating committee, 
we have supplemented the traditional , firm -by-firm approach to supervision with a 
routine use of  horizontal , or cross -firm, reviews to monitor industry practices , common 
trading and funding strategies, balance sheet developments, interconnectedness, and other 
factors with im plications for systemic risk.  Drawing on the work of economists and 
financial market experts, t he coordinating committee  has also made increasing use of 
improved quantitative methods for evaluating the condition s of supervised firms as well 
as the risks they may pose to the broader financial system.  
 An important example of our strengthened , cross -firm supervisory approach is t he 
recently completed seco nd annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review  
(CCAR) .1  In the CCAR, t he Federal Reserve assess ed the internal capital planning

 processes of the 19 largest bank holding companies and evaluated their  capital adequacy 
under a very severe  hypothetical stress scenario  that included a peak unemployment rate 
of 13 percent, a 50 percent drop in equity prices, and a further 21 percent  decline in 
housing prices .  From a  traditional safety -and-soundness perspective, we looked at 
whether each firm would have suf ficient capital  to remain financially stable , taking into 
account its capital distribution proposal,  under the stress scenario.  The simultaneous 
review, by common methods, of the nation’s largest bank ing firms  also helped us better 
evaluate the resilience of the system as a whole, including the capacity of the banking 
system to continue to make credit available  to households and businesses  if the economy 
were to  perform  very poorly.   Because stress tests will be an enduring  part of the 
supervisory toolkit , we are evaluating the recent exercise particularly closely to identify 
both the elements that worked well and the areas in which execution and communication 
can be improved.   
 We also now  routinely use macropr udential methods in analyzing the potential 
consequences  of significant economic events  for the individual firms we supervise  and 
for the financial system as a whole .  A good example is our response to the European 
sovereign debt concerns that emerged in t he spring of 2010.  Since th ose concerns  arose , 
we have been actively monitoring U.S. banks’  direct and indirect exposures to Europe 
and tracking the bank s’ manage ment of  their exposures.  We have also been analyzing 
scenarios under which European sovereig n debt  developments  might lead to broader 
dislocations , for example , through a sharp increase in investor risk aversion that 
adversely  affects asset values.  This work  not only  has improved our understanding of

 banks’  individual risk profile s, it also has helped us better  evaluate  the potential effects of 
financial disruptions in Europe on credit flows and economic activity in the United 
States.  
Macroprudential considerations  are being incorporated  into the development of 
new regulat ions as well as into su pervision .  For example, in December, the Federal 
Reserve issued a package of proposed rules to implement sections  165 and 166 of the 
Dodd -Frank  Act.  The rules would establish prudential standards for the largest bank 
holding companies and systemically  important nonbank financial firms , standards  that 
become more stringent as  the systemic footprint of the firm  increase s.  We are also 
collaborating with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and foreign 
authorities to help implement the FDIC’s new  resolution authority for systemically 
critical firms.  In particular, l ast fall we issued a joint rule with the FDIC  that requires 
each of these firms to produce a credible plan --known as a living will --for an orderly 
resolution in the event of its failur e. 
In the international arena, we strongly supported the Basel Committee’s adoption 
in the summer of 2009 of tougher  regulatory capital standards for trading activities and 
securitization exposures.  We have also worked closely with international partners to help 
develop  the Basel III framework, which requires globally active banks to hold more  and 
higher -quality capital and larger liquidity buffers , and which now incorporates a 
provision  to impose  capital surcharges based on firms’ global systemic importan ce.  
These surcharges are intended to reduce the risk of failure of systemic firms and also to 
force these firms, in their decisions regarding their size and complexity, to internalize the 
possible costs that those decisions might impose on the broader eco nomic and financial   - 5 -  
 
 
 system.  The purpose of each of these steps is to improve the traditional prudential 
regulation of systemically  important firms  while fostering greater stability and resilience 
in the banking system as a whole.     
Nonbank Financial Firm s 
Gaps in the regulatory structure, which allowed some systemically important 
nonbank financial firms to avoid strong, comprehensive oversight, were a significant 
contributor to the crisis.  The Federal Reserve has  been working  with the  other  member 
agenci es of the  Financial Stability Oversight Council ( FSOC ), established by the Dodd -
Frank Act,  to close the se regulatory gaps.  On April 3 the FSOC issued a final rule and 
interpretive guidance implementing the criteria and process it will use to designate 
nonbank financial firms as systemically important.2  Once designated, these  firms would 
be subject to consolidated supervision by the Federal Reserve and would be required  to 
satisfy enhanced prudential standards established by the Federal Reserve under title I of 
Dodd -Frank.  The FSOC’s rule provides detail on the framework the FSOC intends to use  
to assess the potential for a particular  firm to threat en U.S. financial sta bility.  The  
analysis would take into account the firm’s size, interconnectedness, leverage , provision 
of critical products or services, and reliance on short -term funding, as well as its existing 
regulatory arrangements . 
The FSOC’s issuance of this rule i s an important  step forward in  ensuring that  
systemically critical  nonbank financial firms  will be subject to  strong consolidated  
supervision and regulation .  More work remains to be done, however.  In particular, 
                                                 
2 Financial Stability Oversight Council (2012), ""Authority to Require Supervision and Regulation of 
Certain Nonbank  Financial Companies,"" final rule and interpretive guidance (12 C.F.R. pt. 1310; RIN 
4030 -AA00), April 3, available on the Financial Stability Oversight Council website at 
www.treasury.gov/initiatives/fsoc/Pages/final -rules.aspx; forthcoming in the Federal  Register, vol. 77 .   - 6 -  
 
 
 although the basic process for designation  has now been laid out, further refinement of 
the criteria for designation will be needed ; and, for those firms that are ultimately 
designated, it will fall to the Federal Reserve to develop supervisory frameworks 
appropriate to each firm’s business model and risk  profile .  As the FSOC gains 
experience with this process, it will make adjustments to its rule and its procedures  as 
appropriate.   
Regulation of Shadow Banking  
 I have been discussing the oversight of  systemically important financial 
institutions  in a macroprudential context.  However , an important lesson learned from the 
financial crisis is that the growth of what has been termed “shadow banking” creates 
additional  potential  channels for the propagation of shocks throug h the financial system 
and the economy.  Shadow banking refers to the intermediation of credit through a 
collection of institutions, instruments , and markets  that lie at least partly outside of the 
traditional banking system.    
 As an illustration of shadow banking at work, consider  how an automobile loan 
can be made and funded outside of the banking system.  The loan could be originated by 
a finance company that pools it with other loans in a securitization vehicle.  An 
investment bank might sell tranches of the securitization to in vestors.  The lower -risk 
tranches could be purchased by an asset -backed commercial paper (ABCP) conduit that, 
in turn, funds itself by issuing commercial paper that is purchased by money market 
funds.  Alternatively, the low er-risk tranches of loan securit izations might be purchased 
by securities dealers that fund the positions through collateralized borrowing using   - 7 -  
 
 
 repurchase (repo) agreements, with money market funds and institutional investors 
serving as lenders.  
Although the shadow banking system taken  as a whole performs traditional 
banking functions, including credit intermediation and maturity transformation, unlike 
banks , it cannot rely on  the protections afforded by deposit insurance and access to the 
Federal Reserve ’s discount window  to help ensur e its stability.   Shadow banking depends  
instead upon an alternative set of contractual and regulatory protections --for example , the 
posting of collateral in short -term borrowing transactions .  It also relies on certain 
regulatory restrictions on key entities, such as the significant portfolio restrictions on 
money market funds required by rule 2a -7 of the Securities and Exchange Commission 
(SEC) , which  are designed to ensure adequate liquidity and avoid credit losses.  During 
the financial crisis, however, these types of  measures failed  to stave off a classic and self -
reinforcing panic that took hold in parts of the shadow banking system and ultimately 
spread across the financial system more broadly.   
 An important feature of shadow banking is the historical and continuing 
involvement of commercial  and clearing  banks --that is , more  “traditional” bank ing 
institutions .  For example, commercial banks sponsor ed securitizations and ABCP 
conduits, arrangements  which, until recently, permitted those banks to  increase their  
leverage by keep ing the underlying assets off the ir balance sheets.   Clearing banks stand 
in the middle of triparty repo  agreement s, managing the exchange of cash and securities 
while providing protection and liquidity to both transacting parties.   Moreover,  to ease 
operational frictions, clearing banks extend very large amounts of temporary intraday 
credit to borrowers and lenders each day.  This temporary intraday credit --averaging   - 8 -  
 
 
 about $1.4 trillion --allows securities dealers  access to their securities (for example, the 
tranches of loan securitizations  mentioned earlier)  during trading hours . 
 Because of these and other connections , panics and other stresses  in shadow 
banking can spi ll over into  traditional banking.  Indeed, the markets and institutions I 
mentioned --the rep o market, the ABCP market, and money market funds --all su ffered  
panics to some degree during the financial crisis.  As a result, many traditional financial 
institutions lost important funding channels for their assets ; in addition , for reputational 
and contractual  reasons, many banks  supported their affiliated funds  and conduits, 
compounding their own mounting liquidity pressures.   
Status of  Shadow Banking Reform Efforts  
 Given the substantial stakes, I am encouraged that both regulator s and the private 
sector have  begun to take actions to prevent future panics and other disruptions in shadow 
banking.  However,  in many key areas these efforts are still at ea rly stages . 
A first set of reforms relate to the accounting and regulatory capital treatment of 
shadow banking entities sponsored by traditional banks.  The Financial Accounting 
Standards  Board  finalized a rule in 2009 that requires securitizations and oth er structured 
finance vehicles, in certain situations, to be consolidated onto the sponsoring bank’s 
balance sheet.  In the context of regulatory capital, Basel 2.5 and  Basel III addressed  
interconnectedness and other sources of systemic risk frequently as sociated with shadow 
banking by raising capital requirements for exposures to unregulated financial 
institutions , such as asset managers, hedge funds, and credit insurers, and by 
strengthening the capital treatment of liquidity lines to off -balance -sheet s tructures .    - 9 -  
 
 
 Basel III  also includes quantitative liquidity rules that reflect contractual and other  risks 
that arise from bank sponsorship of off -balance -sheet vehicles.  
 A second area of ongoing  reform is money market funds.  In an important  step 
toward greater stability, the SEC in 2010 amended its regulation s to, among other things, 
require that money market funds maintain larger buffers of liquid assets, which may help 
reassure investors and reduce the likelihood of runs.  Notwithstanding the new 
regul ations, the risk of runs  created by a combination of fixed net asset values, extremely 
risk-averse investors, and the absence of  explicit loss absorption capacity  remains a 
concern , particularly since some of the tools that policymakers employed to stem th e runs 
during the crisis are no longer available.   SEC Chairman Mary  Schapiro has advocated 
additional measures  to reduce the vulnerability of money market funds to runs , including  
possibly  requiring  funds to maintain loss -absorbing capital buffers or to redeem shares at 
the market value of the underlying assets rather than a fixed price of $1.  Alternative 
approaches to ensuring  the stability of these funds  have been proposed  as well .  
Additional s teps to increase the resiliency of money market funds are important for the 
overall stability of our financial system  and warrant serious  consideration.  
 A third set of emerging  reforms is aimed at repo  markets , an area in which the 
Federal Reserve has taken an active role .  The initial efforts have  focused on  the 
vulnerabilities created by the  large amounts of  intraday credit provided by clearing banks 
in the triparty repo  market.  Intraday credit, while a great convenience  in normal times , 
may foster systemic risk by  creating large mutual exposures  between securities dealers 
and clearing banks .  In times of market stress, a dealer default on  intraday credit extended 
could be  large enough to pose a threat to the stability of the clearing bank --institution s   - 10 -  
 
 
 tightly connected to the rest of the financial system .  But were a clearing bank to decline 
to provide intraday credit to a dealer, th at dealer’s ability to operate normally would be 
substantially compromised , likely causing difficulties for its clients and counterparties , 
including many other financial inst itutions .  As a result , during a period of market stress, 
the actions of clearing banks can jeopardize the stability of  securities dealers , and vice 
versa . 
 An industry task force recognized this  mutual vulnerability  in 2010 and 
recommended  the “practical elimination”  of intraday credit in the triparty rep o market.   
Although some progress has been made, s ecurities dealers and clearing banks have  yet to 
fully implement that recommendation.  Nevertheless, through supervision and other 
means, we co ntinue to push the industry  toward this critical goal .  In doing so , we are  
collaborating with other agencies, notably the SEC, which has  regulatory responsibility 
for money market funds and securities dealers, institutions that are active in the triparty 
repo market .  At the same time, we continue to urge market participants to improve  their 
risk-management practices , and, in particular, to  ensur e that tools are in place to address  
the risks that would be posed to the repo market by  the default of a major firm.   
 International regulatory groups have also been focused on addressing the financial 
stability risks of shadow banking.  The Group of Twenty leaders  have directed  the 
Financial Stability Board  (FSB) , whose membership consists  of key regulators from 
around the world,  including the Federal Reserve, with developing policy 
recommendations to strengthen the regulation of the shadow banking system.  The FSB 
currently has five major projects under  way devoted to understanding the risks of, and 
developing policy recommendations for, shadow banking.  The areas  under study include    - 11 -  
 
 
 money market funds , securitization , securities lending and the rep o market , banks’ 
interactions with shadow banks , and “other”  shadow banking entities.  Given the 
substantial variation in the structure of shadow banking in different countries,  the FSB’s  
agenda is ambitious .  But it  is also critical in light of the potential risks to stability from 
shadow banking and the ease with  which shadow banking entities can create 
intermediation chains across national borders.   
Monitoring Financial Stability  
 I’ve outlined a number of ongoing efforts, both domestic and international, to 
bring the shadow banking system into the sunlight, so to speak , and to impose tougher 
standards on systemically important financial firms .  But even as we make progress on 
known vulnerabilities, we must be mindful  that our financial system is constantly 
evolving , and that unanticipated  risks to stability  will develop over time.   Indeed, an 
inevitable side effect of new regulations is that the system will adapt in ways that push 
risk-taking from more -regulated to less -regulated areas , increasing the need for careful 
monitoring and supervision of the system as a  whole.  
At the Federal Reserve, we have stepped up our monitoring efforts substantially 
in recent years , with much of the work taking place under the auspices of our recently 
created Office of Financial Stability Policy and Research.  We  conduct an active program 
of research and data collection, often in conjunction with other U.S. and foreign 
regulators and supervisors , including our fellow members on the FSOC .  In addition,  by 
making use of resources throughout the Federal Reserve System,  we are developin g a 
framework and infrastructure for monitoring systemic risk.  Our goal is to have the 
capacity to  follow developments in  all segments of the financial system, including parts   - 12 -  
 
 
 of the financial sector for which data are scarce or that have developed more recently and 
are thus less well understood.   This work complements and is closely coordinated with 
our efforts, mentioned earlier, to supervise systemically important banking organizations 
from a macroprudential perspective.   For example, based on public d ata, we develop and 
monitor  measures of systemic importance that reflect firms’ interconnectedness and their 
provision of critical services .  
  Unfortunately, data on the shadow banking sector, by its nature, can be more 
difficult to obtain.  Thus, we have to be more creative to monitor risk in this important 
area.  We look at broad indicators of risk to the financial system , such as measures of risk 
premiums, asset valuations, and market functioning.  We try to gauge the risk of runs by 
looking at indicators of leverage (both on and off  balance sheet) and tracking short -term 
wholesale funding markets, especially for evidence of maturity mismatches between 
asset s and liabilit ies.  We are also developing new sources of information to im prove the 
monitoring of leverage.  For example, in 2010, we began a quarterly survey on dealer 
financing (the Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms) that 
collects information on the leverage that dealers provide to financial market  participants 
in the rep o and over-the-counter derivatives markets.3  In addition, we are working with 
other agencies to create a comprehensive set of regulatory data on hedge funds and 
private equity firms.  
  Broader economic developments can also create risks to financial stability.  To 
assess such risks, w e regularly monitor a number of metrics, including, for example, the 
leverage of the nonfinancial sector.  In addition, w e use data from the flow of funds 
                                                 
3 The Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms is  available on the Federal Reserve 
Board’s website at www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/releases/scoos.htm .   - 13 -  
 
 
 accounts to assess  how much nonfinancial credit is ultimately being funded with short -
term debt.4  This assessment is important because an overleveraged nonfinancial sector 
could serve to amplify shocks, to the detriment of  the functioning of the financial sector 
and broade r economy.  Our judgment  of how the financial sector is affecting economic 
activity reflects both information on lenders --most notably, underwriting standards, risk 
appetite, and balance sheet capacity --and analytical indicators of macroeconomic 
vulnerabil ity to financial risks.   Meanwhile, efforts are under way, both at the Federal 
Reserve and elsewhere, to evaluate and develop new macroprudential tools and to  
develop early  warning indicators that could help  identify and  limit future buildups of 
systemic risk.  
 In the decades prior to the financial crisis, financial stability policy tended to be 
overshadowed by monetary policy, which had come to be viewed as the principal 
function of central banks.  In the aftermath of the crisis, however, financial stability 
policy has taken on greater prominence and is now generally considered  to stand on an 
equal footing with monetary policy  as a critical responsibility of central banks.  We have 
spent decades buil ding and refining the infrastructure for conducting monetary policy.  
And although we have done much in a short time to improve our understanding of 
systemic risk and to  incorporate a macroprudential perspective into supervision , our 
framework for conducti ng financial stability policy is not yet at the same level.   
Continuing to develop  an effective  set of  macroprudential policy  indicators and tools ,

information on patterns of financial intermediation through a consolidated set of balance sheets for the 
household, business, and government sectors and financial institutions.  The flow of funds accounts are 
published quarterly and are available at www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1 .   - 14 -

Small Business and Entrepreneursh ip during an Economic Recovery 
 
Board of Governors 
 
Washington, D.C. 
 
      
November 9, 2011 
Good morning. Welcome to the Federal Re serve Board and today’s conference, 
“Small Business and Entrepreneursh ip during an Economic Recovery.”   Let me begin by 
thanking the Federal Reserve Bank of A tlanta and the Ewing Marion Kauffman 
Foundation, both of which have cooperated cl osely with the Boar d of Governors in 
organizing this event.  This meeting is inde ed an eclectic one, br inging together small 
business owners, lenders, technical assist ance providers, government officials, and 
members of the academic community to e xplore the challenges faced by today’s 
entrepreneurs and to identify promising approaches to addressing their needs.  Events 
such as this one are particular ly valuable because they allow us to draw on a broad range 
of experiences and evidence.  We are keenly interested in hearing your insights and look 
forward to sharing results from the Federal Reserve’s continued small business outreach and research efforts.    
Some of you may have attended a forum here last year that focused on credit 
access for small businesses.
1  We hope to advance that di scussion today by exploring not 
only the financing needs of cr editworthy small businesses, but  also the role these firms 
could play in creating jobs during these di fficult economic times.  We will also discuss 
the unique challenges faced by women- and mi nority-owned firms.  We hope to be as 
concrete and practical as po ssible; for example, several conference papers assess the 
extent to which training, techni cal assistance, and other resour ces are available to support 
these and other small firms.  The ultimate goal of this meeting is to learn more about how 
best to support both small businesses and their communities--to understand what works and what doesn’t.

 Importance of Small Businesses to the Economy 
It’s no secret that the past few years have been very difficult for many small 
firms.  They have faced weak sales, dimini shed asset values, elevated uncertainty, and 
tight credit market conditions.  Many sma ll business owners have had to lay off 
employees or defer hiring.  And many potenti al entrepreneurs with plans to start new 
businesses have put those plans on hold.   
The role of small businesses and entrep reneurship in job creation will be 
discussed in our first panel today.  As ma ny of you are aware, small businesses have 
played an important role in fu eling past economic recoveries.  We need to think carefully 
about how, in the current economic environm ent, our nation can best provide small 
businesses and entrepreneurs w ith the support they need to  expand job opportunities.  
Small businesses also help our country co mpete globally; they often offer a level 
of agility in bringing innovative products to  the global marketplace that larger firms 
cannot match.  At home, many entrepreneurs do more than provide important goods and 
services--they and their businesses help sustai n the vitality of the neighborhoods in which 
they live and work.  Frequently, small busin ess owners demonstrate their commitment to 
their communities by serving in leadership positions in local schools, volunteering for 
local nonprofit organizations, a nd engaging in civic affairs. 
For many people, starting a small busin ess is an opportunity to follow one’s 
particular dream.  We should recognize that it can also be an important option for people 
confronting economic challenges in their lives, such as insufficient retirement savings.  A 
study conducted by the Kauffman Foundation suggests that  both baby boomers and older - 3 - 
 
 
 generations are increasingly turning to entrepreneurial activities.2  Tomorrow’s 
discussion will pay special attention to how  these and other new entrepreneurs are 
adjusting to the changing lands cape of financial services.   
Federal Reserve Efforts to Support Small Businesses 
The Federal Reserve System is committed to supporting small business and 
entrepreneurship.  We do that, for example, through research that adds to our stock of 
knowledge about the catalysts for and barrier s to entrepreneurship, and through outreach 
programs to help small business owners and ot her community stakeholders gain access to 
a range of financing and technical assistance.   
For instance, in a recent fo rum sponsored by the Federal Reserve System and held 
in Jacksonville, Florida, both small business owners and their lende rs stressed that it 
takes more than an enterprising spirit to  succeed; entrepreneurs also must seek 
appropriate training and resour ces.  Forum participants emphasized the need to support

extension, of our economy as a whole.  Base d on the wide variety of perspectives 
represented at today’s conference, I feel su re you won’t agree on th e answers to all the 
many questions that will be raised.  But the di alogue itself is of grea t value.  We at the 
Federal Reserve have found that conferences such  as this one help us to more effectively 
conduct our outreach and analytical work.  We hope that each of you will find this 
experience worthwhile as well.  Thank you in  advance for sharing your insights about the 
challenges for small businesses, and I look fo rward to seeing the results of your work.  ",2011-11-09,bernanke

Recent Economic Developments and the  Challenges Ahead  
   
Remarks by 
 
Jerome H. Powell  
 
Chair  
 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  
 
at the 
 
National Association for Business Economics  
 
Virtual Annual Meeting  
       
October 6, 2020 
  
Good morning.  It has been just eight months since the pandemic first gained a 
foothold on our shores, bringing with it the sharpest downturn on record, as well as the 
most forceful policy response in living memory.  Although it is too early for definitive  
conclusions, today I will offer a current assessment of the response to the economic fallout of this historic event and discuss the path ahead.   
The Pre -COVID Economy 
As the coronavirus spread across the globe, the U.S. economy was in its 128th 
month of expansion—the longest in our recorded history —and was generally in a strong 
position.  Moderate growth continued at a slightly above -trend pace.  Labor market 
conditions were strong across a range of measures.  The unemployment rate was running at 50- year lows.  PCE ( personal consumption expenditures ) inflation was running just 
below our 2 percent target.  
The economy did face longer -term challenges, as all economies do.  Labor force 
participation among people in their prime working years had been trending down since the turn of the millennium, and productivity gains during the expansion were disappointing.  Income and wealth disparities had been growing for several decades.  As the expansion continued its long run, however, productivity started to pick up, t he labor 
market strengthened, and the benefits of growth began to be more widely shared.  In particular, improved labor market conditions during the past few years encouraged more prime -age workers to rejoin or remain in the labor force.  Meanwhile, real w age gains for 
all workers picked up, especially for those in lower paying jobs.   
Most economic forecasters expected the expansion and its benefits to continue, 
and with good reason.  There was no economy- threatening asset bubble to pop and no  - 2 - 
unsustainabl e boom to bust.  While nonfinancial business leverage appeared to be 
elevated, leverage in the household sector was moderate.  The banking system was 
strong, with robust levels of capital and liquidity.  The COVID -19 recession was unusual 
in that it was no t triggered by a buildup of financial or economic imbalances.  Instead, the 
pandemic shock was essentially a case of a natural disaster hitting a healthy economy.   
Given the condition of the economy, in the early stages of the crisis it seemed 
plausible t hat, with a rapid, forceful, and sustained policy response, many sectors of the 
economy would be able to bounce back strongly once the virus was under control.  That response would need to come from actions across all levels of government, from health and fiscal authorities, and from the Federal Reserve.   
It also seemed likely that the sectors most affected by the pandemic—those 
relying on extensive in- person contact —would face a long and difficult path to recovery.  
These sectors and people working in the m would likely need targeted and sustained 
policy support.  
Some asked what the Fed could do to address what was essentially a medical 
emergency.  We identified three ways that our tools could help limit the economic damage from the pandemic:  providing st ability and relief during the acute phase of the 
crisis when much of the economy was shut down; vigorously supporting the expansion when it came; and doing what we could to limit longer -run damage to the productive 
capacity of the economy.   
The Recession and Nascent Recovery  
When it became clear in late February that the disease was spreading worldwide, 
financial markets were roiled by a global flight to cash.  By the end of the month, many  - 3 - 
important markets were faltering, raising the threat of a financia l crisis that could 
exacerbate the economic fallout of the pandemic.  Widespread economic shutdowns 
began in March, and in the United States, with many sectors shut down or operating well below capacity, real GDP fell 31 percent in the second quarter on an annualized basis.  Employers slashed payrolls by 22 million, with those on temporary layoff  rising by 
17 million.  Broader measures of labor market conditions, such as labor force 
participation and those working part time for economic reasons, showed furt her damage.  
In response, we deployed the full range of tools at our disposal, cutting rates to 
their effective lower bound; conducting unprecedented quantities of asset purchases; and establishing a range of emergency lending facilities to restore market function and support the flow of credit to households, businesses, and state and local governments.  We also implemented targeted and temporary measures to allow banks to better support their customers.  
The fiscal response was truly extraordinary .  The unanimous passa ge of the 
CARES Act and three other bills passed with broad support in March and April  
established wide- ranging programs that are expected to provide roughly $3 trillion in 
economic support  overall —by far the largest and most innovative fiscal response to an 
economic crisis since the Great Depression.   
What have these policies managed to accomplish so far?   
First, the substantial fiscal aid has given vital support to households.  The rise in 
transfers supported necessary spending and contributed to a shar p increase in household 
saving.  Goods consumption is now above its pre -pandemic level.  Services consumption 
remains low, although it seems likely that much of this weakness is the byproduct of  - 4 - 
health concerns and social distancing, rather than reductions  in income and wealth.  
Consumption held up well through August after the expiration of expanded 
unemployment insurance benefits, indicating that savings from transfer payments continue to support economic activity.  A recent Fed survey showed that households in July had surprisingly upbeat views of their current financial well -being, with 77 percent 
of adults either “ doing okay”  or “living comfortably,” an improvement even over the 
reading immediately preceding the pandemic.
1  Still, since it appears that many will 
undergo extended periods of unemployment, there is likely to be a need for further support.  
Second, aid to firms —in particular, the Paycheck Protection Program —and the 
general boost to aggregate demand have so far partly forestalled an expected wave of bankruptcies and lessened permanent layoffs.  Business investment appears to be on a renewed upward trajectory and new business formation similarly appears to be rebounding, pointing to some confidence in the path ahea d. 
Third, after briefly seizing up in March, financial markets have largely returned to 
normal functioning, albeit in the context of extensive ongoing policy support.  Financial conditions are highly accommodative, and credit is available on reasonable ter ms for 
many —though not all —households and businesses.  Interest -sensitive spending has been 
relatively strong, as shown in the housing and auto sectors.  
Taken together, fiscal and monetary policy actions have so far supported a strong 
but incomplete recove ry in demand and have —for now —substantially muted the normal

September 2020 and available on the Board’s website at

recessionary dynamics that occur in a downturn.  In a typical recession, there is a 
downward spiral in which layoffs lead to still lower demand, and subsequent additional layoffs.  This dynamic w as disrupted by the infusion of funds to households and 
businesses.  Prompt and forceful policy actions were also likely responsible for reducing risk aversion in financial markets and business decisions more broadly.   
While the combined effects of fiscal  and monetary policy have aided the solid 
recovery of the labor market so far, there is still a long way to go.  Payrolls have now recovered roughly half of the 22 million decline.  After rising to 14.7 percent in April, the unemployment rate is back to 7.9 percent, clearly a significant and rapid rebound.  A broader measure that better captures current labor market conditions —by adjusting for 
mistaken characterizations of job status, and for the decline in labor force participation since February —is running around 11 percent.   
The burdens of the downturn have not been evenly shared.  The initial job losses 
fell most heavily on lower -wage workers in service industries facing the public —job 
categories in which minorities and women are overrepresented.  In Au gust, employment 
of those in the bottom quartile of the wage distribution was still 21 percent below its 
February level, while it was only 4 percent lower for other workers.
2  Combined with the 
disproportionate effects of COVID on communities of color, and the overwhelming 
burden of childcare during quarantine and distance learning, which has fallen mostly on women, the pandemic is further widening divides in wealth and economic mobility. 
                                                 
2 Using data from ADP, the Board staff estimate that at the end of April, 41 percent of the workers in the 
bottom quartile  (based on their previous wage) ha d lost their jobs, compared with only 13 percent for the 
other three quartiles.   See the Board’s June 2020 Monetary Policy Report, available at 
https://www.feder alreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/20200612_mprfullreport.pdf , for more details.   - 6 - 
The Road Ahead  
I will now turn to the outlook.  The recovery has progressed more quickly than 
generally expected.  The most recent projections by FOMC (Federal Open Market 
Committee) participants at our September meeting show the recovery continuing at a solid pace.  The median participant saw unemployment declining to 4 pe rcent and 
inflation reaching 2 percent by the end of 2023.  Of course, the economy may perform better or worse than expected.  The outlook remains highly uncertain, in part because it depends on controlling the spread and effects of the virus .  There is a risk that  the rapid 
initial gains from reopening may transition to a long er than expected  slog back to full 
recovery as some segments struggle with the pandemic’s continued fallout.  The pace of economic improvement has moderated since the outsize gains of  May and June, as is 
evident in employment, income, and spending data.  The increase in permanent job loss, as well as recent layoffs, are also notable.   
We should continue do what we can to manage downside risks to the outlook.  
One such risk is that C OVID -19 cases might  again rise to levels that more significantly 
limit economic activity, not to mention the tragic effects on lives and well -being.  
Managing this risk as the expansion continues will require following medical experts’ guidance, including us ing masks and social -distancing measures.   
A second risk is that a prolonged slowing in the pace of improvement over time 
could trigger typical recessionary dynamics, as weakness feeds on weakness.  A long period of unnecessarily slow progress could conti nue to exacerbate existing disparities in 
our economy.  That would be tragic, especially in light of our country’s progress on these issues in the years leading up to the pandemic.    - 7 - 
The expansion is still far from complete.  At this early stage, I would argue that 
the risks of policy intervention are still asymmetric.  Too little support would lead to a 
weak recovery, creating unnecessary hardship for households and businesses.  Over time, household insolvencies and business bankruptcies would rise, harming the productive capacity of the economy, and holding back wage growth.  By contrast, the risks of overdoing it seem, for now, to be smaller.  Even if policy actions ultimately prove to be greater than needed, they will not go to waste.  The recovery will be stronger and move 
faster if monetary policy and fiscal policy continue to work side by side to provide 
support to the economy until it is clearly out of the woods. 
Given this audience, I would be remiss were I not to mention our review of our 
monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications, which concluded recently with our adoption of a flexible average inflation- targeting regime.  My colleagues and I have 
discussed this new framework in detail in recent remarks.  Today I will just note that the 
underlying structure of the economy changes over time, and that the FOMC’s framework for conducting monetary policy must keep pace.  The recent changes to our consensus statement reflect our evolving understanding of several important developments.  There has been a decline in estimates of the potential or longer -run growth rate of the economy 
and in the general level of interest rates, presenting challenges for the ability of monetary policy to respond to a downturn.  On a more positive note, we have seen tha t the 
economy can sustain historically high levels of employment, bringing significant societal benefits and without causing a troubling rise in inflation.  The new consensus statement acknowledges these developments and makes appropriate changes in our mo netary policy 
framework to position the FOMC to best achieve its statutory goals.    - 8 - 
The forward rate guidance adopted at our September meeting reflects our new 
consensus statement.  The new guidance says that, with inflation running persistently 
below our longer -run 2 percent goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation 
moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer -term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent.  The 
Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of policy until these outcomes 
are achieved.  The Committee also left the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at 0 to 1/4 percent, and it expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until l abor market conditions have reached levels that are consistent with the 
Committee’s assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.   
We expect that the new framework and guidance will support our efforts in 
pursuit of a strong economic recovery. 
Thank you.  I look forward to our discussion.  ",2020-10-06,powell

Normalizing Monetary Policy:  Prospects and Perspectives  
   
Remarks by  
 
Janet L. Yellen  
 
Chair  
 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  
 
at 
 
“The New Normal Monetary Policy ,” a research c onference  
sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco  
 
San Francisco, California  
  
 
 
   
March 27, 2015  
  
I would like to thank President Williams for his kind introduction and the Federal 
Reserve Bank of San Francisco for inviting me to what promises to be a very stimulating 
and important conference. 
As you know, last week the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) changed 
its forward guidance pertaining to the federal funds rate.  With continued improvement in economic conditions, an increase in the target range for that rate may well be warranted later this year.  Of course, the timing of the first increase in the federal funds rate and its subsequent path will be determined by the Committee in light of incomin g data on labor 
market conditions, inflation, and other aspects of the  current expansion.   
In my remarks today I will discuss some factors that will likely guide our 
decisions as we adjust the stance of monetary policy over time .  I will also discuss why 
most of my colleagues and I believe the return of the federal funds rate to a more normal 
level is likely to be gradual.  In doing so, I will address three questions .  First, why does 
the Committee judge that an increase in the federal funds rate target is  likely to become 
appropriate later this year?  Second, how are economic and financial considerations likely to shape the course of monetary policy over the next several years?  And, finally, are there special risks and other considerations that policymake rs should take into account in 
the current environment?  
Current Economic Condi tions and the Outlook  
Before turning to these questions, however, let me first review where the 
economy is now and where it’s likely headed --a necessary backdrop for understandin g 
why, after more than six years of maintaining a near -zero federal funds rate and 
accumulating a large portfolio of longer -term securities, the Committee is now giving  - 2 - 
serious consideration to begin ning to reduce  later this year some of the extraordinary 
monetary policy accommodation currently in place. 
Although the recovery of the labor market from the deep recession following the 
financial crisis was frustratingly slow for quite a long time, progress has been more rapid 
of late.  The unemployment rate has fallen markedly over the past few years and now stands at 5.5 percent, down from 10 percent at its peak.  Payroll gains have averaged 275,000 per month over the past year , well above the pace needed to sustain further 
declines in the unemployment  rate.  Of course , we still have some way to go to reach our 
maximum employment goal.  The unemployment rate has not yet declined to the 5.0 to 5.2 percent range  that most FOMC participants now consider to be normal in the longer 
run.  Involuntary part -time employ ment remains high by historical standards.  Labor 
force participation is still somewhat lower than I would expect after accounting for demographic trends.
1  And wage growth continues to be quite subdued.  But I think we 
can all agree that the recovery in t he labor market has been substantial . 
I am cautiously optimistic that, in the context of moderate growth in aggregate 
output and spending, labor market conditions are likely to i mprove further in coming 
months.  In particular, and despite the somewhat disa ppointing tone of the recent retail

sales data, I think consumer spending is likely to expand at a good clip this year given 
such robust fundamentals as strong employment gains, boosts to real incomes from lower  
energy prices, continued increases in household wealth, and a relatively high level of consumer confidence.  Of course, not all sectors of the economy are doing as  well :  dollar  
appreciation appears to be restraining net exports, low oil prices are prompting a cutback in drilling activity, and the r ecovery in residential construction remains subdued.  But 
overall, I anticipate that real gross domestic product is likely to expand somewhat faster than its potential in coming quarters, thereby promoting further gains in employment and declines in the unemployment rate.  
In assessing the actual strength of the labor market and the broader economy , we 
must bear in mind that these very welcome improvements have been achieved in the context of extraordinary monetary accommodation.  While the overall level of real activity now appears to be much closer to its potential than it was a year or two ago, the 
economy in an “underlying ” sense remains quite weak by historical standards, for the 
simple reason that the increases in hiring and output that have been achiev ed thus far 
have required exceptionally low levels of short - and longer -term interest rates, reflecting 
a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy.  Interest rates have been, and remain, very low, and if underlying conditions had truly returned to normal, the economy should be booming.  As I will discuss shortly, this assessment concerning the underlying strength of real activity has important policy implications.  
While there has been considerable progress on the maximum employment leg of 
our dual mandate, progress on the price stability leg has been notably absent.  Inflation as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures has been running  - 4 - 
below the FOMC’s longer -run goal of 2 percent for  a number of years, and on a 
12-month basis  is currently 1/4 percent.  Some of the weakness in inflation likely reflects 
continuing slack in labor and product markets.  However, much of this weakness stems 
from the sharp decline in the price of oil and other one -time factors that, in the FOMC ’s 
judgment, are likely to have only a transitory negative effect on inflation, provided that inflation expectations remain well anchored.   
In this regard, I take comfort from the continued stability of survey measures of 
longer -run inflation expectations .  And although market -based measures of inflation 
compensation have declined appreciably since last summer and bear close watching, I 
suspect that these declines are primarily driven by changes in risk premiums and market factors that I expect to prove trans itory .  On balance, I therefore think it is appropriate for 
monetary policy to remain accommodative for some time, fostering an environment of tightening labor and product markets that, together with stable inflation expectations, will 
help move inflation up to 2 percent over the medium term.   
Why M ight an I ncrease in the Federal F unds R ate B e Warranted L ater T his Y ear?   
The Committee's decision about when to begin reducing accommodation will 
depend importantly on how economic conditions actually evolve over time.  Like  most of 
my FOMC colleagues , I believe that the appropriate time has not yet arrived, but I expect 
that conditions may warrant an increase in the federal funds rate target sometime  this 
year.  So let me spell out the reasoning that underpins  this view.  
I would first note that the current stance of monetary policy is clearly providing 
considerable economic stimulus.  The near -zero setting for the federal funds rate has 
facilitated a sizable reduction in labor market slack over the past two years and appears to  - 5 - 
be consistent with further substantial gains.  A modest increase in the federal funds rate 
would be highly unlikely to halt this progress, although such an increase might slow its 
pace somewhat.  
Second, we need to keep in mind the well -established fact that the full effects of 
monetary policy are felt only after long lags.  This means that policymakers cannot wait until they have achieved their objectives to begin adjusting policy.  I would not consider it prudent to postpone the onset of normalizatio n until we have reached, or are on the 
verge of reaching, our inflation objective.  Doing so would create too great a risk of significantly overshooting both our objectives of maximum sustainable employment and 
2 percent inflation, potentially undermining economic growth and employment if the FOMC is subsequently forced to tighten policy markedly or abruptly.  In addition, holding rates too low for too long could encourage inappropriate risk- taking by investors, 
potentially undermining the stability of fina ncial markets.  That said, we must be 
reasonably confident at the time of the first rate increase that inflation will move up over time to our 2 percent objective , and that such an action will not impede continued solid 
growth in employment and output.  
An important factor working to increase my confidence in the inflation outlook 
will be continued improvement in the labor market.  A substantial body of theory, informed by considerable historical evidence, suggests that inflation will eventually begin to rise as resource utilization continues to tighten.
2  It is largely for this reason that a

Orrenius (2014), “A Closer Look at the Phillips Curve Using State Level Data,” Working Papers 1409 
(Dallas:  Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas),

significant pickup in incoming readings on core inflation will not  be a precondition for 
me to judge that an initial increase in the federal funds rate would be warranted.  With 
respect to wages, I anticipate that real wage gains for American workers are likely to pick 
up to a rate more in line with trend labor productivity growth as employment settles in at its maximum sustainable level.  We could see nominal wag e growth eventually running 
notably higher than the current roughly 2 percent pace.  But the outlook for wages is highly uncertain even if price inflation does move back to 2 percent and labor market conditions continue to improve as projected.  For exampl e, we can not be sure about the 
future pace of productivity growth; nor can we be sure about other factors, such as global 
competition, the nature of technological change, and trends in unionization, that  may also 
influence the pace of real wage growth over  time.  These factors, which are outside of the 
Federal Reserve’s control, likely explain why real wages have failed to keep pace with productivity growth for at least the past 15 years.  For such reasons, we can never be sure 
what growth rate of nominal w ages is consistent with stable consumer price inflation, and 
this uncertainty limits the usefulness of wage trends as an indicator of the Fed’s progress in achieving its inflation objective.     
I have argued that a pickup in neither wage nor price inflati on is indispensable for 
me to achieve reasonable confidence that inflation will move back to 2 percent over time.  That said, I would be uncomfortable raising the federal funds rate if readings on wage 
discussed extensively in the literature ; for instance, see Robert J. Gordon (2013), “The Phillips Curve Is 
Alive and Well:  Inflation and the NAIRU during the Slow Recovery,” NBER Working Paper Series 19390 
(Cambridge, Mass.:  National Bureau of Economic Research, August).  In addition, the app arent lack of 
disinflationary pressure seen during the recent recession is not necessarily a puzzle for the New Keynesian 
Phillips curve, as shown in Marco Del Negro, Marc P. Giannoni, and Frank Schorfheide ( 2015 ), “Inflation 
in the Great Recession and New  Keynesian Models,” American Economic Jo urnal:  Macroeconomics , 
vol. 7 (January), pp. 168- 96.

growth, core consumer prices, and other indicators of underlying inflation pressures were 
to weaken, if market -based measures of inflation compensation were to fall appreciably 
further, or if survey -based measures were to begin to decline noticeably.   
Under normal circumstances, simple monetary policy rules, such as the one 
proposed by John Taylor, could help us decide when to raise the federal funds rate.3  
Even with core inflation running below the Committee's 2 percent objective, Taylor’s 
rule now calls for the federal funds rate to be well above zero if t he unemployment rate is 
currently judged to be close to its normal longer -run level and the “normal” level of the 
real federal funds rate is currently close to its historical average.  But the prescription 
offered by the Taylor rule changes significantly i f one instead assumes, as I do, that 
appreciable slack still remains in the labor market , and that the economy’s equilibrium 
real federal funds rate--that is, the real rate consistent with the economy achieving maximum employment and price stability over the medium term--is currently quite low by historical standards.
4  Under assumptions that I consider more realistic under present 
circumstances, the same rules call for the federal funds rate to be close to zero.5  
3 For the original exposition of the Taylor rule, see John B. Taylor (1993), “Discretion Versus Policy Rules 
in Practice,” Carnegie -Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy,  vol. 39, pp.  195-214.  For a 
discussion of policy rules in general, see John B. Taylor and John C. Williams (2010), “Simple and Robust 
Rules for Monetary Policy,” in Benjamin M. Friedman and Michael Woodford, eds., Handbook of Monetary Ec onomics , vol. 3B (San Diego:  Elsevier), pp. 829- 59.
     
4 The equilibrium real rate is typically viewed as the level of the short- term interest rate, less inflation, 
estimated to be consistent with maximum employment and stable inflation in the long run, assuming no 
future disturbances to the economy.  Accordingly, the equilibrium real rate is usually thought of as 
independent of the cyclical disturbances that routinely buffet the economy, on the assumption that the influences of such disturbances on real activity and inflation fade away after a few years .  In the aftermath 
of the financial crisis, however, the U.S. economy has been subject to various adjustment processes that are 
unusually drawn out by historical standards, such as the ongoing repair of ho usehold balance sheets and 
other persistent headwinds.  These atypical processes imply that, in determining the appropriate stance of 
monetary policy over time, policymakers in the current environment need to take account of slow -moving 
influences on both aggregate demand and supply that were not important factors during previous tightening episodes.  For this reason, it is useful to think of the equilibrium real rate in present circumstances as not only time -varying but also having a predictable element that evolves over the medium term.  
5 For example, the Taylor rule is 𝑅𝑅 𝑡𝑡=𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅∗+𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡+0.5(𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−2)+0.5𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡, where R denotes the federal funds 
rate, RR* is the estimated value of the equilibrium real rate, π is the current inflation rate (usually measured                                                   - 8 - 
Moreover, I would assert that simple rules  are, well, too simple, and ignore important 
complexities of the current situation, about which I will have more to say shortly.  
  The FOMC will, of course, carefully deliberate about when to begin the process 
of removing policy accommodation.  But the si gnificance of this decision should not be 
overemphasized , because what matters for financial conditions and the broader economy 
is the entire expected path of short -term interest rates and not the precise timing of the 
first rate increase.  The spending an d investment decisions the FOMC seeks to influence 
depend primarily on expectations of policy well into the future, as embedded in longer -
term interest rates and other asset prices.  More important than the timing of the 
Committee ’s initial policy move will be the strategy the Committee deploys in adjusting 
the federal funds rate over time , in re sponse to economic developments, to achieve its 
dual mandate.  Market par ticipants’ perceptions of that reaction function and the 
implications for the likely longer -run trajectory of short -term interest rates will influence 
the borrowing costs faced by households and businesses, including the rates on corporate bonds, auto loans, and home mortgages.     
How A re Economic and Financial Considerations L ikely to S hape the Course of 
Monetary P olicy  over the N ext Se veral Y ears?   
Let me therefore turn to the second question I posed earlier:  How are  economic 
and financial considerations likely to shape the course of monetary policy over the next 
using a  core consumer price index), and Y  is the output gap.  The latter can be approximated using Okun’s 
law, 𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡=−2(𝑈𝑈𝑡𝑡−𝑈𝑈∗), where U is the unemployment rate and U*  is the natural rate of unemployment.  If 
RR* is assumed to equal 2 percent (roughly the average historical value of the real federal funds rate) and 
U* is assumed to equal 5 -1/2 percent, then the Taylor rule would call for the nominal funds rate to be set a 
bit below 3 percent currently, given that core PCE inflation is now running close to 1 -1/4 pe rcent and the 
unemployment rate is 5.5 percent.  But if RR* is instead assumed to equal 0 percent currently (as some 
statistical models suggest) and U* is assumed to equal 5 percent (an estimate in line with many FOMC 
participants’ SEP projections), then t he rule’s current prescription is less than 1/2 percent.                                                    - 9 - 
few years?  Let me first be clear that the FOMC does not intend to embark on any 
predetermined course of tightening following an initial decision to raise the funds rate target range--one that, for example, would involve similarly  sized rate increases at every 
meeting or on some othe r schedule.  Rather, the actual path of policy will evolve as 
economic conditions evolve, and policy tightening could speed up, slow down, pause, or even reverse course depending on actual and expected developments in real activity and inflation.  Reflecting such data dependence, as well as some historically unusual policy considerations that I will discuss shortly, the average pace of tightening observed during previous recoveries could well provide a highly misleading guide to the actual course of monetar y policy over the next few years.  Our goal in adjusting the federal funds rate 
over time will be to achieve and sustain economic conditions close to maximum employment with inflation averaging around 2 percent, responding, as best we can, to the inevitabl e twists and turns of the economy.  
Keeping in mind the all- important proviso that policy is never predetermined but 
is always data dependent, what can we say about the appropriate path of policy , assuming 
the most likely outcomes for real activity, inflation, and related factors?  The answer is that it depends, of course, on one’s outlook for the economy.  Today I will focus on the modal outlook presented by FOMC participants’ submissions to the March Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which assumes that no further unanticipated disturbances buffet the economy.  As I noted at my press conference after last week ’s FOMC meeting, 
participants generally project that the unemployment rate will continue to fall through late 2017 to levels at or somewhat bel ow estimates of its longer -run sustainable level, 
accompanied by growth in real gross domestic product that runs somewhat above its  - 10 - 
estimated longer -run trend with inflation moving up to around 2 percent.  This solid 
economic performance is projected to be consistent with a gradual normalization of 
monetary policy:   The median funds rate projection in the March SEP increases 
a percentage point per year on average through the end of 2017.   
The projected combination of a gradual rise in the nominal federal f unds rate 
coupled with further progress on both legs of the dual mandate is consistent with an 
implicit assessment by the Committee that the equilibrium real federal funds rate --one 
measure of the economy’s underlying strength --is rising only slowly over t ime.  In the 
wake of the financial crisis, the equilibrium real rate apparently fell well below zero because of numerous persistent headwinds. These headwinds include tighter underwriting 
standards and restricted  access to some forms of credit;  the need fo r households to reduce 
their debt burdens;  contractionary fiscal policy at all levels of government after the initial 
effects of the fiscal stimulus package had passed ; and elevated uncertainty about the 
economic outlook that made firms hesitant to invest and hire, and households reluctant to buy houses, cars , and other discretionary goods.   
Fortunately, the overall force of these headwinds appears to have diminished 
considerably over the past year or so, allowing employment to accelerate appreciably even as the level of the federal funds rate and the volume of our asset holdings remained nearly unchanged.
6  Stated differently, the economy’s underlying strength has been 
6 Although the FOMC suspended its asset purchase program last October, the stimulus provided by this 
type of unconventional monetary policy action depends primarily on the stock of longer -term assets held by 
the Federal Reserve, not the flow of securities bought.  Because the FOMC has held the size of the Federal 
Reserve’s balance sheet constant since October while continuing to keep the federal funds rate near zero, the overall stance of monetary policy is thus little changed over this period.  However, the downward 
pressure on long- term interest rates from the Federal Reserve’s asset holdings should decline over time, 
particularly after the FOMC suspends its current reinvestment policy, because the average duration of the 
assets held in the portfolio will be steadily falling and because the relative size of the portfolio to the stock 
of publicly held debt will be shrinking.                                                    - 11 - 
gradually improving , and the equilibrium real federal funds rate has been gradually 
rising.  Although the recent appreciation of the dollar is likely to weigh on U.S. exports 
over time, I nonetheless anticipate further diminution of the headwinds just noted over 
the next couple of years, and as the equilibrium real funds rate continues to ris e, it will 
accordingly be appropriate to raise the actual level of the real federal funds rate in tandem, all else being equal.
7  At present, the equilibrium real federal funds rate, which 
by some estimates is currently close to zero, appears to be well below the longer -run 
normal levels assessed by the FOMC.  The median SEP estimate of this longer -run 
normal rate --that is, the long -run projection of the nominal funds rate less 2 percent 
inflation --stood at 1- 3/4 percent in the FOMC's recent projections.8  Provided that 
inflation shows clear signs over time of moving up toward 2 percent in the context of continuing progress toward maximum employment, I therefore expect that a further 
tightening in monetary policy after the first increase in the federal funds  rate will be 
warranted.  Should incoming data, however, fail to support this forecast, then the actual path of policy will need to be adjusted appropriately.  
7 If resource utilization was at a normal level and inflation was equal to 2 percent, policymakers would 
presumably opt to set the real federal funds rate equal to the equilibrium real rate in order to maintain those 
conditions.  Accordingly, if the equilibrium rate is rising over time, the “neutral” setting of monetary policy  
should be rising in tandem.  
8 For example, the estimate of the equilibrium real rate from the Laubach -Williams model for 2014:Q4 is 
negative 0.16.  For information on the model, see  Thomas Laubach and John C. Williams (2003), 
“Measuring the Natural Rate o f Interest,” Review of Economics and Statistics,  vol. 85 (November), 
pp. 1063- 70; updated estimates of the baseline model are available on the Federal Reserve Bank of San 
Francisco website at www.frbsf.org/economic -research/economists/john -
williams/Laubach_Williams_updated_estimates.xlsx .  Another recent study, however, concludes that the 
equilibrium real rate is probably in the range of 1  to 2 percent while also emphasizing that estimates in this 
area are quite imprecise; see James D. Hamilton, Ethan S. Harris, Jan Hatzius, and Kenneth D. West (2015), “The Equilibrium Real Funds Rate:  Past, Present, and Future,” working paper (San Diego:  
University of California  at San Diego, March), http://econweb.ucsd.edu/~jhamilto/USMPF_2015.pdf . 
Note that the concept of the equilibrium real rate used in the latter study is explicitly lon g-run in nature and 
so excludes the effects of forces that have persistently restrained the pace of the current expansion but are 
expected to eventually fade away, such as household balance sheet repair; for this reason, the paper’s 
estimate is higher than  the medium -run concept of the equilibrium real rate discussed in the speech.                                                    - 12 - 
Are There Special Risks and Other Considerations T hat Policymakers Should Take 
into Account i n the Current E nvironment?  
As I noted, my FOMC colleagues and I generally anticipate that a rather gradual 
rise in the federal funds rate will be appropriate over the next few years, conditional on 
our baseline forecasts for real activity, inflation , and othe r aspects of the economy’s 
performance.  So far in my remarks, I have emphasized one key rationale for such a judgment --namely, that the equilibrium real federal funds rate is at present well below its 
historical average and is anticipated to rise only gradually over time as the various headwinds that have restrained the economic recovery continue to abate.  If incoming data support such a forecast, the federal funds rate should be normalized, but at a gradual pace.  
Several additional factors reinforce this  conclusion , and that brings me to my third 
question:  Are there special risks and other considerations that policymakers should take 
into account  in the current environment ?  Keeping in mind that the actual course of 
monetary policy in the future will primarily depend on events as they unfold, I see three additional considerations that are relevant.
9   
The first, which is closely related to my expectation that the headwinds holding 
back growth are likely to continue to abate gradually, pertains to the risk that the equilibrium real federal funds rate may not, in fact, recover as much or as quickly as I 
9 In principle, the three considerations --uncertainty about the value of the equilibrium real federal funds 
rate, the asymmetric risks associated with the zero lower bound on nom inal interest rates, and the potential 
benefits of allowing the unemployment rate to temporarily undershoot its sustainable longer -run rate --
should influence both the timing of the onset of policy normalization and the subsequent pace at which that 
normali zation proceeds.  And in fact, I view all three considerations as helping to explain why the FOMC 
has held the federal funds rate near zero for so long.  I also view such considerations as consistent with a likely increase in the target federal funds rate later this year, because such an increase would be part of a 
broader strategy for only gradually reducing accommodation over time (subject, of course, to adjustments 
in response to incoming information on real activity, inflation, and other factors).                                                    - 13 - 
anticipate.  Substantial uncertainty surrounds all estimates of the equilib rium real interest 
rate, and , as I will discuss momentarily, market participants appear to be fairly 
pessimistic about the odds that it will rise significantly over time.  Moreover, some recent 
studies have raised the prospect that the economies of the Uni ted States and other 
countries will grow more slowly in the future as a result of both demographic factors and a slower pace of productivity gains from technological advances.  At an extreme, such developments could even amount to a type of “secular stagna tion,” in which monetary 
policy would need to keep real interest rates persistently quite low relative to historical norms to promote full employment and price stability, absent a highly expansive fiscal policy.
10   
Such a risk has important implications for monetary policy in the near term, when 
the ability of the economy to adjust to significant rate increases will be especially 
uncertain.  The experience of Japan over the past 20 years, and Sweden more recently, demonstrates that a tightening of policy when the equilibrium real rate remains low can result in appreciable economic costs, delaying the attainment of a central bank’s price stability objective.  International experience therefore counsels caution in removing accommodation until the Committee is more confident that aggregate demand will 
10 The concept of “secular stagnation” was first coined back in the late 1930s; see Alvin H. Hansen (1938),  
“The Consequences of Reducing Expenditures,” Proceedings of the Academy of Political Science , vol. 17 
(January), pp. 60-72; and Alvin H. Hansen (1939),   “Economic Progress and Declining Population 
Growth,” American Economic Review , vol. 29 (March), pp. 1 -15.  This possibility, and its applicability to 
the United States and other developed economies in coming years, has received considerable attention of 
late; see Robert J. Gordon (2014), “The Demise of U.S. Economic Growth:  Restatement, Rebuttal, and 
Reflections,” NBER Working Paper Series 19895 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic 
Research, February); Robert E. Hall (2014), “Quantifying the Lasti ng Harm to the U.S. Economy from the 
Financial Crisis,” in Jonathan Parker and Michael Woodford, eds., NBER Macroeconomics Annual, vol. 29 (Chicago: University of Chicago Press) ; and Lawrence H. Summers (2014), “U.S. Economic Prospects:  
Secular Stagnation , Hysteresis, and the Zero Lower Bound,” Business Economics , vol. 49 (April), 
pp. 65-73.  For a more skeptical assessment of the secular stagnation hypothesis , see Hamilton  and others ,

continue to expand in line with its expectations --a view that is also supported by the 
research literature.11  
A second reason for the Committee to proceed cautiously in removing policy 
accommodation relates to asym metries in the effectiveness of monetary policy in the 
vicinity of the zero lower bound.  In the event that growth in employment and overall 
activity proves unexpectedly robust and inflation moves significantly above our 2 percent objective, the FOMC can and will raise interest rates as needed to rein in inflation.  But if growth was  to falter and inflation was to fall yet further, the effective lower bound on 
nominal interest rates could limit the Committee ’s ability to provide the needed degree of 
accommo dation.  With an already large balance sheet, for example, the FOMC might be 
concerned about potential costs and risks associated with further asset purchases.   
Research suggests that, the higher the probability of monetary policy becoming 
constrained by the zero lower bound in the near future because of adverse shocks, and the 
more severe the attendant consequences for real activity and inflation, the more current 
policy should lean in accommodative direction.
12  In effect, such a strategy represents 
insur ance against the zero lower bound by aiming for somewhat stronger real activity and 
11 A number of studies have shown, using model simulations, that policymakers can improve 
macroeconomic performance by adjusting the stance of monetary policy more cautiously in response to 
changes in economic conditions when the economy’s equilibrium real interest rate is uncertain.  For a 
survey of the literature on this issue, see John B. Taylor and John C. Williams (2010), “Simple and Robust Rules for Monetary Policy,” in Benjamin M. Friedman and Michael Woodford, eds., Handbook of 
Monetary Economics,  vol. 3 B (San Diego:  Elsevier), pp. 829 -59.

Lower Bound on Nominal Interest Rates,” Journal of Monetary Economics , vol.  54 (3), 728 -52; Taisuke

a faster rise in inflation under the modal outlook.  Given the modal outlook envisioned in 
FOMC participants’ recent forecasts, with headwinds continuing to diminish, the equilibrium real rate rising, and inflation moving back up to 2 percent over the next few 
years, the risk that the funds rate would need to return to near zero should be declining appreciably.  Consi stent with this assessment, almost all FOMC participants n ow view 
the risks to the outlook for real activity as largely balanced, although some also see inflation risks as weighted to the downside. 
That said, it is sobering to note that many market participants appear to assess the 
risks to the outlook quite diff erently.  For example, respondents to the Survey of Primary 
Dealers in late January thought there was a 20 percent probability that, after liftoff, the funds rate would fall back to zero sometime at or before late 2017.
13  In addition, both the 
remarkably l ow level of long -term government bond yields in advanced economies and 
the low prevailing level of inflation compensation suggest that financial market 
participants may hold more pessimistic views than FOMC participants concerning the 
risks to the global outlook.  Since long -term yields reflect the market’s probability -
weighted average of all possible short -term interest rate paths, along with compensating 
term and risk premiums, the generally low level of yields in advanced economies suggests that investor s place considerable odds on adverse scenarios that would 
necessitate a lower and flatter trajectory of the federal funds than envisioned in participants’ modal SEP projections.
14  
13 See Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Markets Group (2015), Responses to Survey of Primary Dealers  
(New York:  FRBNY, January), www.newyorkfed.org/markets/survey/2015/January -result.pdf . 
14 Of course, low long- term yields in the United States may not reflect investor pessim ism about U.S. 
economic prospects but instead an expectation that weak economic performance abroad may result in 
persistent upward pressure on the dollar, thereby putting downward pressure on U.S. net exports, 
employment, inflation, and thus short- term int erest rates.  On a closely related issue concerning evidence 
that investors’ perceptions of the likelihood of high inflation versus low inflation have shifted noticeably in                                                   - 16 - 
A final argument for gradual ly adjusting policy relates to the desirability of 
achieving a prompt return of inflation to the FOMC’s 2 percent goal, an objective that 
would be advanced by allowing the unemployment rate to decline for a time somewhat below estimates of its longer -run sustainable level.  To a limited degree,  such an outcome 
is envisioned in many participants’ most recent SEP projections.  A tight labor market may also work to reverse some of the adverse supply -side developments resulting from 
the financial crisis.  The deep recession and slow recovery likely have held  back 
investment in physical and human capital, restrain ed the rate of new business formation, 
prompt ed discouraged workers to leave the labor force, and erode d the skills of the long -
term unemployed.
15  Some of these effects might be reversed in a tight labor market, 
yielding long -term benefits associated with a more productive economy.  That said, the 
quantitative importance of these supply -side mechanisms are difficult to establish , and 
the relevant r esearch on this point is quite limited.    
Of course, taking a gradualist approach is not without risks.  Proceeding too 
slowly to tighten policy could have adverse consequences for the attainment of the Committee ’s inflation objective over time, especiall y if it were to undermine the FOMC ’s 
inflation credibility.  Inflation could, for example, exhibit nonlinear dynamics in which high levels of unemployment place relatively little downward pressure on inflation, but tight labor markets generate marked upwar d pressure.  If so, a decline in unemployment

below its natural rate could cause inflation to quickly rise to an undesirably  high level.  
Rapid increases in short -term interest rates to arrest such an unwelcome development 
could, in turn, have adverse effe cts on financial markets and the broader economy.  
Proceeding too cautiously could also have undesirable effects on financial 
stability.  An environment of prolonged low short -term rates could prompt an excessive 
buildup in leverage or cause underwriting st andards to erode as investors take on risks 
they cannot measure or manage appropriately in a reach for yield.16  At this point the 
evidence indicates that such vulnerabilities do not pose a significant threat,  but the 
Committee is carefully monitoring developments in this area.17  Moreover, in my view, 
macroprudential regulatory and supervisory tools should serve as our first line of defense 
in addressing these risks.18  
Conclusion  
To conclude, let me emphasize that in determining when to initially increase its 
target range for the federal funds rate and how to adjust it thereafter, the Committee’s decisions will be data dependent, reflecting evolving judgments concerning the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook.  We cannot be certain about the underlying strength of the expansion, the maximum level of employment 
consistent with price stability , or the longer -run level of interest rates consistent with

changes.   However, if conditions do evolve in the manner that most of my FOMC 
colleagues and I anticipate, I would expect  the level of the federal funds rate to be 
normalized only gradually, reflecting the gradual diminution of headwinds from the financial crisis and the balance of risks I have enumerated of moving either too slowly or too quickly .  Nothing about the course of the Committee’s actions is predetermined

May 18, 2023  
  
 Good morning , everyone .  Thank you for inviting me to speak .  It is a pleasure to 
be here.  I would like to  use this opportunity  to share with you my outlook  on the U .S. 
econom y, credit conditions , and monetary policy.  
Before I start , let me remind you that the views I will express today are my own 
and are not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System . 
Aggregate Economic Activity  
Despite heightened uncertainty, due to  banking -sector stress, geopolitical 
instability , and the aftermath of the pandemic , I expect the econo my to grow in the 
second quarter .  The pace of growth, however, will be slower than what we observed in 
the first  quarter , when real GDP increased at an annual rate of 1.1 percent.  My 
expectation is based mainly on data that showed weakening spending in recent months , 
and other data that imply  moderating spending, including a sizable decline in April in 
consumer sentiment , as measured by the initial estimate of the University of Michigan 
Survey s of Consumers.  While my base case forecast for the U.S. economy is not a 
recession, I expect spending and GDP growth to remain quite slow over the rest of 2023, 
due to  continued tight  financial conditions, low consumer sentiment, and a decline in 
househol d savings that had built up after the onset of the pandemic.   Further more , I 
acknowledge that there are  downside risks, among them the possibility  that the degree of  
bank lending  restraint  and uncertainty could weigh on economic activity  more than I 
expect . 
The Labor Market  
Even as GDP growth has slowed, employment has continued to increase, and the 
current labor market is one of the stronges t that U.S. workers have experienced in  
 - 2 - 
decades.  The economy created  253,000 jobs in April and the unemployment rate was 
3.4 percent, the lowest since 1969.  Job creation has been remarkably resilient to tighter 
financial conditions.  Employers have added an average of 280,000 jobs a month this 
year.  That’s down from the 350,000 a month created in the second half of 2022 but st ill 
robust .  The tight labor market has boosted wages and other compensation for workers . 
Wage growth has continued to run ahead of the pace consistent with 2 percent inflation 
and current trends in productivity growth.  Wage gains are welcome a s long as they are 
consistent with price stability.  Over the 12 months ended in March 2023, the 
employment cost index (ECI) for total hourly compensation for private -sector workers 
rose 4.8 percent, down only a little from its peak of 5.5 percent last Jun e.      
My expectation is that the slowing economy will soon begin to reduce job growth , 
with labor supply and labor demand coming into better balance.  The unemployment rate  
may rise  gradually  to levels still consistent with a growing economy.  Data on jo b 
openings and voluntary quits by workers indicate that labor demand has eased somewhat , 
and this is reflected also in a modest decline in the growth of average hourly earnings, 
from a 12-month rate of 5 percent in November to 4.4 percent in April.  
Inflation  
Now let me turn to the outlook for inflation .  While inflation  has come down 
substantially since last summer, it is still too high, and  by some measures progress has 
been slowing.  After peaking at a 12 -month rate of 7 percent last June, personal  
consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation fell to 4.2 percent in March , which is also 
down from 5 .1 percent in February.  That reflects substantial decreases in energy prices 
and a big slowdown in food inflation .  Cheaper energy and a slow down in food pric e  
 - 3 - 
increases are good news for lower - and middle -income households that spend a larger 
share of their income for  these items.  
But outside of energy and food, the progress on inflation remains a challenge .  
Excluding these prices, which tend to be more volat ile than prices of other goods and 
services , leaves what we call “core” inflation , and this measure is a useful guide to 
discern longer -lasting movements in  inflation.  Core PCE inflation  was 4.6 percent in 
March, down from a peak of 5.4 percent in February 2022 .  While we do not have  a 
report on PCE inflation for April yet, another inflation measure, the core component  of 
the consumer price index  (CPI) , showed little further improvement in Ap ril.  Looking 
more closely at core inflation, I like to divide it into three parts —core goods inflation ; 
housing, which is classified as a service ; and nonhousing services.  Core good s inflation 
fell sharply over the second half of 2022  as supply -chain bot tlenecks eased , but more 
recently it has stabilized  at around 2.6 percent .  Housing services  inflation , which 
include s rent and the equivalent for owner -occupied homes, is 8.2 percent  on a 12 -month 
basis .  Housing is a big part of inflation, and while rent increases on new leases have 
come down considerably over the past year, it will take some time for this softening in 
rents  to show through  to the  12-month changes.   And, finally,  inflation in nonhousing 
services, the largest component of services , has been stubbornly high at around 
4.5 percent  and show s no signs of significant decline  yet. 
Recent Stress in the Banking Sector  
Overall, the U.S. banking system is sound and resilient, and I am confident it will 
be able to c ontinue to play its important role providing credit to households and 
businesses.  Nevertheless, it is reasonable to expect that recent  stress events will lead  
 - 4 - 
some banks to tighten credit standards further .  The evidence is that so far there has been 
only a modest incremental tightening of lending conditions, which had already tightened 
considerably over the past year since the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates.  In 
a survey conducted by the Federal Reserve in April, loan officers reported that 46 percent 
of banks had tightened credit terms in the previous three months for commercial and 
industrial lending to larger firms, versus 44.8 percent that had tightened in the January 
survey.  The April survey’s increase in the share of banks reporting ti ghtening was 
similar, though a bit larger, for commercial and industrial lending to smaller firms.  At 
this point, it is hard to tell how much of this tightening was in train already, after 
continued increases in interest rates, and it is likewise difficul t to say how much the stress 
in midsized banks will ultimately curtail credit in the coming year.  Furthermore, there is 
considerable uncertainty about the magnitude of the impact on household spending and 
business investment, and this uncertainty complica tes economic outlook forecasts.  
The Insurance Industry Resiliency  
Given  your gathering here today, I would be remiss if I did not say a word or two 
about the insurance industry before closing.  The insurance industry has performed well 
through recent stresses.  Although  the profitability of  property and casualty insurance 
companies in  2022 was reduced by natural catastro phes and inflation , the industry’s 
capital appears  strong when considering a range of plausible stress events .  For life 
insurers, the recent increase in interest rates has been a mostly welcome development that 
has supported higher investment returns but also poses risks, such as early withdrawals 
by some policyholders.  While the life insurance industry’s capitalization remains strong,  
 - 5 - 
the use of reinsurance merits continued monitoring . With that said, let me turn to 
monetary policy.  
Considerations for Monetary Policy  
So what  factors will I consider in the coming weeks as I contemplate the 
appropriate stance of monetary policy going forward ?  Over the next few weeks, we will 
receiv e a considerable amount of data on economic activity for April and May, including 
the employment report for May and a report on May CPI inflation .  Monetary policy 
should be  forward -looking .  It should be conducted so that longer -term inflation 
expectations are well  anchored around our inf lation target of 2 percent.   Monetary policy  
should also be  data dependent  to allow  for continuous learn ing about the underlying  
structure of the economy as new data arrive .  These principles  of monetary policymaking 
are always valuable , especially so when  the level of uncertainty is high, as it is now.   
I am guided by the dual mandate assigned  to the Federal Reserve by the U.S. 
Congress :  price stability and maximum employment .  On the one hand, inflation is too 
high, and we have not yet made  sufficient progress  on reducing it .  On the other hand, 
GDP has slowed considerably this year, and even though the effect has been muted in the 
labor market so far, demand clearly has begun t o feel the effects of interest rates that are 
5 percentage points higher than they were a little over a year ago.  History shows that 
monetary policy works with long and vari able lags, and that a year is not a long enough  
period for demand to feel the full  effect of higher interest rates .  Another  factor weighing 
on my thinking  is the uncertainty about tighter lending standards  that I mentioned  earlier .  
I intend to consider all these factors in the coming weeks as I c ontemplate  the appropriate 
stance of monetary  policy  going forward .

Banks and Bank Lending:  The State of Play  
 
 
Remarks by  
 
Ben S. Bernanke  
 
Chairman  
 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  
 
via Satellite  
 
to the 
48th Annual Conference on Bank Structure and Competition  
Sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago

May 10, 2012  
  
I am pleased to speak this morning at what has become, over nearly 50 years, 
perhaps the most prestigious conference for bankers, academics , and bank supervisors in 
the United States.  The first part of my remarks will highlight the significant progress th at 
has been made over the past several years toward  restoring the banking system to good 
health .  I will also talk about some of the challenges banks face as they adapt to the post -
crisis economic and regulatory environment.  I  will then review recent tren ds in credit 
conditions, noting that bank lending  has generally been improving but remains restrained  
in some areas.  
The State of the Banking System  
Since the financial crisis, banks have made considerable  progress in repairing 
their balance sheets and bu ilding capital.   Risk-based capital and leverage ratios for banks 
of all sizes have improved materially and are significantly above their previous highs.   
Importan tly, the 19 largest banking institutions  that participated in the 2009 stress tests, 
as well as the two subsequent Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review ( CCAR ) 
processes, have considerably more and better -quality capital  than a few years ago .  
Indeed, t hose firms  have increased their Tier 1 common equity, the best buffer against 
future losses, by more than $300 billion  since 2009 , to nearly $760 billion.  The Tier 1 
common ratio for these firms, which compares this high-quality capital to risk -weighted 
assets, sto od at 10 -1/2 percent at the end of last year.  
The latest CCAR , conducted earlier this year,  demonstrated that most of the 19 
firms would likely have sufficient capital to withstand a period of intense  economic and 
financial stress  and still be able to len d to households and businesses .  The hypothetical 
supervisory stress scenario used in the CCAR was quite severe ; it included a peak  
 - 2 - 
unemployment rate of 13 percent, a 50  percent drop in equity prices, and a 21 percent 
further decline in housing prices , as well as steep falls in prices of  financial assets most 
exposed to conditions in Europe .  Under this highly adverse scenario, the 19 bank holding 
companies were projected to incur aggregate losses of more than $500 billion through the 
fourth quarter of 2013 .  Nevertheless, their aggregate Tier 1 common ratio was projected 
to be 6.3 percent at the end of the scenario period, and 15 of the 19  bank holding 
companies  were  projected to maintain capital ratios above all four of  the regulatory 
minimum levels --even after taking into account  their propos als for capital actions  such as 
dividends, share buybacks, and share issuance  in the baseline scenario . 
The banking sector overall also has substantially improved its liquidity position 
over the past few years .  Indeed , large banks in the aggregate have more than doubl ed 
their holdings of cash and securities  since 2009 .  Large banks have reduced their 
collective dependence on short -term wholesale  funding , and many are flush with retail 
deposits, which tend to be a more stable funding source .  Challenges on the liquidity front 
remain , however :  Some  large firms still rely heavily on wholesale short -term funding ; 
and the liquidity needs of the banking system as a whole may become somewhat higher 
for a while  as some of the securities issued under the F ederal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation ’s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program  come due , and as the unlimited 
insurance on noninterest -bearing transaction accounts expires at the end of the year.  
Nevertheless, over time, greater  liquid  asset  positions and reduced dependence on 
wholesale short -term funding , together with more and better capital,  will make the 
banking sector  less susceptible to unexpected disruptions in  short -term funding markets.   
 - 3 - 
The credit quality of  large banks ’ assets is looking better as well , although the 
improvements have been uneven  across types of loans .  In the aggregate, delinquency 
rates on loan  portfolios at large banks  have declined  substantially  from their peaks .  
However, while delinquencies on comm ercial and industrial (C&I) loans and consumer 
loans have fallen to the lower end of their historical ranges , delinquencies  on loans 
backed by commercial or residential real estate  have declined  only moderately  and 
remain elevated . 
The profitability of lar ge banks has  been edging up as credit quality has firmed 
and banks  have trimmed noninterest expenses.  Even so , large banks’  profitability 
remain s well below the levels that prevailed before the financial crisis began, and  banks  
continue to struggle to exp and their revenues.  Developments that can be traced back to 
the financial crisis --including  a still -weak economy, changes in market conditions and 
practices, and tighter financial regulation s--are clearly important reasons for these trends.  
Community bank s play important role s in local economies, and so it is notable 
that their condition  has also improved .  Their r egulatory capital ratios have increased 
significantly since 2009 and stand well above their recent norms.  As has been the case at 
large banks, delinquency and charge -off rates at community banks have declined across 
most major categories of loans , and  fewer institutions failed in 2011 than in each of the 
previous two years.  That said, clusters of small bank failures can affect credit availabilit y 
in a community while bank -dependent borrowers work to establish new relationships 
with surviving institutions.  In addition,  while standard measures of community banks’ 
profitability , such as return on equity and assets , improved last year, as was also t rue at  
 - 4 - 
larger institutions, most  of the gains were due to reductions in loan loss provisions  rather 
than to more sustainable sources  of profit such as expanded lending .   
Financial -market indicators reflect the substantial improvements in banks’ 
financial conditions  since the crisis as well as  the sizable challeng es remaining.  Bank 
credit default swap ( CDS ) premiums are now well below the ir crisis peaks, and b ank 
stock  price s have retraced some of their earlier losses and have outperformed the broader 
mark et this year, boosted somewhat by the release of the CCAR results in March  and 
first-quarter earnings that largely beat analysts’ expectations .  However, CDS  premiums 
remain elevated for some of the larger, more globally connected firms , and their stocks 
continue to trade at market -to-book ratios of less than 1.    
A number of key systemic risk measures  that evaluate the potential performance 
of firms during  times of financial market  stress  have improved  in recent months .  These 
indicators  of systemic risk  are now  well below their levels in the crisis, and, overall, they 
present a picture of a banking system that has become healthier and more resilient.1 
Regulatory and Financial Challenges  
Banks face a number of significant challenges as they adapt to the post -crisis 
economic environment and to new domestic and international regulatory requirements .  
The most systemically important financial firms will face meaningfully higher capital and 
liquidity requirements  and continue to undergo regular supervisory stress tests .  They will 
                                                 
1 Such measures include the conditional value at  risk, or CoVaR,  which is an estimate of the extent to 
which a bank’s distress would be associated with an increase in the downside risk to the financial system; 
the distress insurance premium, or DIP, which measures the cost of insuring a firm against systemwide  
distress; and the systemic expected shortfall, or SES, which estimates the extent to which the market value 
equity of a firm would be depleted by a marketwide decline in equity prices.  These measures are based on 
firms ’ stock prices, CDS  premiu ms, and stock price volatility, as well as the correlatio n in asset prices 
across firms.

also be required to submit so -called living wills to facilitate their orderly resolution if 
necessary.  Additionally, banks must enhance  their reporting systems  and i mprove 
disclosure.  These new requirements are critical to safeguard the stability of the financial 
system  and to help prevent another costly crisis .  At the same time, regulators appreciate 
that the new rules impose significant burdens on banks .  For that  reason, and to minimize 
adverse effects on the supply of credit, many of the most significant rules  are being 
phased in gradually  and only after extended processes of consultation with industry and 
other stakeholders .   
It is worth re iterating  that most o f these enhanced regulatory and supervisory 
measures focus on  the largest, most interconnected financial institutions, and we are 
working to ensure that community banks  are not subjected to rules designed primarily to 
constrain risks at larger institutions.   We have an ongoing dialogue with community 
banks through many channels, including, for example, our Community Depository 
Institutions Advisory Council.  The council, whose membership is drawn from smaller 
banks, credit unions, and savings as sociations in each of the 12 Federal Reserve Districts, 
meets with the Board in Washington twice a year to discuss supervisory and regulatory 
issues that affect their institutions.  We have also established a special supervis ory 
subcommittee of the Board w hich focuses on community banking issues.  
In addition to strength ened regulatory and supervisory requirements,  banks face 
market demands that they operate with  more resilient business models.   In many contexts, 
counterparties are demanding greater security  in the form of more  and better -quality 
collateral or higher margins.   In addition, lenders to banks may be  requiring greater 
compensation for risk, thereby raising b anks’  funding costs .    
 - 6 - 
Banks have also been  navigating an economic recovery that has been halting  at 
times .  Consequently, although  the condition of the banking system is improving , demand 
for credit generally has remained sluggish , and the credit worthiness  of some  borrowers  
that would normally turn to banks for  loans remains  impaired .  These factors, together 
with tighter credit policies  imposed by many lenders, have restrained somewhat  the 
expansion of bank credit.   
Credit  Conditions and Bank Lending  
Notwithstanding the  various  headwinds, credit conditions in the United States 
have improved significantly in a number of areas .  Many--though certainly not  all--
businesses and households are finding it easier to borrow  than they did a few years ago , 
in part because of better  conditions in finan cial markets more broadly .  Large b usiness es 
with access to capital markets have generally been able to raise funds at attractive terms , 
with b oth investment - and speculative -grade firms taking  advantage of historically low 
interest rates  to issue  bonds at  a robust rate .  Moreover, consumer s with strong  credit 
histories have ready access to credit cards and auto loans, supported by solid issuance of 
consumer -related  asset -backed securities . 
Banks also supply credit by purchasing securities, and their purcha ses have grown 
rapidly in recent months --in particular, those of agency -guaranteed mortgage -backed 
securities ( MBS ).  In this challenging time for housing markets, banks are attracted by the 
securities’ government guarantee .  Additionally , some larger banks may be accumulating 
these securities in preparation for  more -stringent liquidity regulations.  
Signs of improvement notwithstanding , credit conditions in some sectors and for 
some types of borrowers remain tight.  Mortgage lending is an important exam ple.  Since  
 - 7 - 
its peak, U.S. home mortgage credit outstanding has contracted about 13 percent in real 
terms.  Many factors suggest that th is situation will be  difficult to  turn around  quickly , 
including the slow recovery of the economy and housing market, co ntinued uncertainty 
surrounding the future of the government -sponsored enterprises ( GSEs ), the lack of a 
healthy  private -label securitization market, and cautious attitudes by lenders.   
Financing conditions in the commercial real estate sector also remain strained as 
fundamentals, including high vacancy rates, depressed property prices, and the poor 
quality of existing loans , continue to be weak .  Moreover, the market for commercial 
MBS --a source of liquidity for some lenders in this sector --is still  struggling to regain its 
footing.    
The Federal Reserve’s quarterly Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank 
Lending Practices  (SLOOS)  offers a more -nuanced view of how lending terms are 
changing .  The SLOOS  indicates that standards and terms  in many loan categories have 
eased somewhat further in recent quarters from the very tight conditions that prevailed 
earlier in the recovery .2  For example, t he April SLOOS pointed to the first material net 
easing in lending standards for commercial real estate lo ans since 2005  and to a further 
easing of standards for most types of consumer loans.  In addition, SLOOS respondents  
suggested that stepped -up competition has induced a large number of domestic banks to 
reduce fees and spreads on C&I loans to firms of all  sizes .  The SLOOS also indicates 
that demand for many types of loans has continued to  increase , with  demand for C&I 
loans ha ving risen to relatively high levels.   
                                                 
2 The SLOOS is available on the Board’s website at www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/snloansurvey .  
 - 8 - 
Consistent with the results of the SLOOS , C&I l ending has indeed  been rising 
sharply lately .  Banks have focused on  C&I l ending  because business  borrowers’ 
creditworthiness is improving  and because the majority of C&I loans carry floating 
interest rates  that reduce interest rate risk .  In addition, domestic banks  reportedly  are 
picking up custome rs as a result of a pullback by some  European institutions.   Auto 
lending also has reportedly been solid, reflecting strong  fundamentals in auto markets --
such as robust  demand for use d cars and relatively low delinquency rates on existing auto 
loans .  The strong fundamentals for auto loans  in turn also appear to have contributed to 
an easing of lending standards and terms.   
But, a s I mentioned earlier, residential mortgage lending has been particularly 
sluggish.  T ight lending standards and terms remain especially evident .  To be sure, a 
return to pre-crisis lending standards  for residential mortgages  wouldn’t be appropriate ; 
however,  current standards may be limit ing or prevent ing lending to many creditworthy 
borrowers.  For instance , in the April SLOOS , we asked banks a hypothetical question 
about their wi llingness to originate GSE -eligible mortgages relative to 2006 for  
borrowers with a range of credit scores and available down  payments.  The SLOOS 
found that even when the loans were accompanied by a 20 p ercent down  payment,  many 
banks w ere less likely to originate loans to borrowers with given GSE -eligible credit 
scores, despite the originating bank’s ability to sell the mortgage to the GSEs.  Most 
banks indicated that their reluctance to accept mortgage applications from borrowers with 
less-than-perfect records  is related to “putback risk” --the risk that a bank might be forced 
to buy back a defaulted loan if the underwriting or documentation was judged deficient in 
some way.    
 - 9 - 
Small businesses owners, who in the past might have tapped into the equity in 
their homes or us ed their homes as collate ral for small  business loans , also have found 
conditions challenging  in recent years .  The stock of small loans to businesses on bank 
balance sheets at the end of last year was more than 15 percent below its peak in 2008.  
These loans looked to have ticked  up in the fourth quarter of 2011, consistent with the 
reported increase in demand for loans by small firms in the SLOOS.  Responses to  the 
monthly National Federation of Independent Business survey  also suggest some  modest  
improvement in the small busines s sector:  The share of respondents reporting a need for 
credit has moved up from lows  of recent years , and the net share  of respondents who say 
that credit is more difficult to obtain than it was three months ago is notably below its 
peak in 2009.   
The Fe deral Reserve is keenly interested in understanding how shifts in loan 
supply , loan demand , and borrower quality  may be affecting lending and , by extension , 
the broader economy.  Of course, sorting out the relative effect of changes in loan 
demand from the effect of changes in loan supply can be quite difficult  because they can 
be influenced by the same factors .  For example, a shift in the economic outlook can 
affect both the willingness of banks to lend a nd the desire and ability of firms and 
households to borrow.   
Recent research at the Federal Reserve  examines cyclical changes in bank s’ 
lending standards as reported in the SLOOS --a commonly used indicator of loan supply .  
It attempts to assess how much of those changes were a “typical” response to  
 - 10 - 
macroeconomic and bank -specific factors , and how much was “atypical” or unexplained.3  
This analysis  suggests that the tightening of lending standards that occurred between 
2007 and 2009 was much greater than a model based on historical experience would 
predict , contribut ing to the subdued pace of lending.   These results are consistent with 
other evidence that the crisis induced exceptionally high levels of risk aversion and 
uncertainty on the part  of both lenders and borrowers, constraining the flow of credit.   As 
these factors have receded and the economy has improved, lending standards have 
become less stringent.   
Some ban kers and borrowers believe that enhanced supervision and regulation has 
made it more difficult for banks to expand their lending.  The Federal Reserve takes 
seriously its responsibility to ensure that supervisory actions to protect banks’  safety and 
soundness do not unintentionally constrain lending to creditworthy borrowers, and we 
have taken a variety of steps to address these concerns.  For example, we have issued 
guidance to supervisors stressing the importance of taking a balanced approach to 
supervision and of promptly upgrading a bank’s supervisory rating when warranted by a 
sustainable improvement in its condition and risk management.  Some analysis has 
indicated that, all else being equal, banks with lower supervisory ratings tend to lend less; 
prompt upgrades by supervisors when such upgrades are appropriate may thus ease  an 
unnecessary constraint on lending .  Indeed, in the fourth quarter of 2011 and the first 
quarter of this year , the number of ratings upgrades for banks and bank holding

companies supervised by the Federal Reserve exceeded the number of downgrades.  The 
last time that upgrades exceeded downgrades was in 2005.  In addition,  we have stepped 
up examiner training on relevant lending issues, and we have emphasized to examiners 
that an open dialogue with bank management is essential.   
We have also looked into specific concerns raised about the examination process 
and its effect on banks’ willingness to lend.  For example, during 2011, we reviewed 
commercial real estate loan clas sification practices to assess whether examiners were 
properly implementing the interagency policy statement on workouts of commercial  real 
estate loans.  We analyzed  documentation for more than 300 loans with identified 
weaknesses in six Federal Reserve Districts.  We found that Federal Reserve examiners 
were appropriately implementing the guidance and were consistently taking a balanced 
approach in determining loan classifications.  Moreover, the documentation we reviewed 
indicated that examiners were car efully considering the full range of information 
provided by bankers, including relevant mitigating factors, in determining the regulatory 
treatment for the loans.  
Conclusion  
To sum up, conditions in the banking system --and the financial sector more 
broad ly--have impr oved significantly in the past few years .  Banks have  strengthen ed 
their capital and liquidity  positions .  The economic recovery  has facilitated th e rebuilding 
of capital and  helped improve the quality of the loans and other assets on banks’  balance 
sheets.   Nonetheless, banks still have more to do to restore their health and adapt to the 
post-crisis regulatory  and economic  environment.  As the  recovery  gains  greater  traction,  
increasing both the demand for credit and the creditworthiness of potential borrowers, a   
 - 12 - 
financially stronger banking system will be well positioned to expand its lending.  
Improving  credi t conditions will in turn help create a more robust economy.   ",2012-05-10,bernanke

Challenges for State and Local Governments 
   
Remarks by 
 
Ben S. Bernanke 
 
Chairman 
 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
 
at the 
 
2011 Annual Awards Dinner  
of the Citizens Budget Commission 
 
New York, New York 
           
March 2, 2011 
  
I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to a group that has such a long and 
distinguished record in id entifying and addressing crucial issues affecting the 
governments of the city and state of New York.  I will focus this evening on a top 
challenge not only for New York, but also fo r states and localities across the nation--
namely, the imperative of achieving fiscal sust ainability in both the short and the long 
term.  I will first discuss the fiscal pressure s currently confronting states and localities, 
then turn to longer-term challenges and opportunities faced by these jurisdictions. 
Recent State and Local Fiscal Developments 
  As you know well, the deep recession of 2008 through 2009 and the subsequent 
slow recovery have battered state and local budgets.  As the recession took hold, revenues 
dropped precipitously, especially at the stat e level.  Driven partly by balanced-budget 
requirements under their constitutions, ma ny governments have responded by cutting 
numerous programs and reducing workforces.  As  necessary as these cuts may have been, 
they have left some jurisdic tions struggling to maintain e ssential services.  The fiscal 
problems of state and local governments have also had national implications, as their 
spending cuts and tax increases have b een a headwind on the economic recovery.  
Moreover, concerns about both the current fiscal condition of these governments and 
their longer-term commitments to provide pens ions and health benefits have recently led 
to strains in municipal bond markets. 
The recession’s effects on state government s have been substantial.  In calendar 
year 2009, state tax revenues were about 12 perc ent lower than they had been in 2008; 
declines in wages, salaries, capital gains, and profits reduced income tax revenues, and 
sales tax collections droppe d along with household and busin ess spending.  Reflecting  - 2 -
somewhat better economic conditions, state tax revenues for the first nine months of 2010 
were 3 percent higher than during the compar able period a year earlier--a relatively 
modest improvement in comparison to the earl ier decline.  Meanwhile, on the spending 
side of the ledger, demand for publicly finan ced medical care and other public services 
soared as the economy weakene d.  Most notably, Medicaid cas eloads rose from less than 
43 million at the start of the recession in December 2007 to more than 50 million in June 
2010--an increase of nearly 18 percent.  Th e experience of New York state has not 
differed greatly from that of other states:  Tax revenues here decr eased about 13 percent 
in 2009 and then rose about 7 percent during the first nine months of 2010.  Meanwhile, 
the state’s Medicaid enrollmen ts increased from about 4 m illion at the end of 2007 to 
4-3/4 million in mid-2010--about in line with the national trend.   In contrast to the sharp drop in stat e tax revenues, local tax revenues across the 
country have held up relatively well over the past  couple of years.  In part, this difference 
reflects localities’ greater reli ance on property taxes.  Cha nges in real estate values 
typically feed through to tax assessments and pr operty tax bills with a considerable lag; 
some jurisdictions have also raised their prop erty tax rates to offset weakness in assessed 
values.  The continued softne ss in real estate prices, however, does not bode well for 
local government revenues.  Moreover, many lo calities have been hard hit by reductions 
in state aid, which in 2008 accounted for about 30 percent of local revenues.  Indeed, the 
fiscal 2011 budgets of more than 20 states c ontained either outright reductions in local 
aid, changes to revenue-sharing agreements, or cuts in funding for specific programs that  - 3 -
are run by local governments--such as educat ion for grades kindergarten through 12, road 
maintenance, and property tax relief.1  
Assistance from the federal government --mainly through the stimulus grants 
included in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) and the 
additional Medicaid and education grants provi ded last summer--has relieved some of the 
fiscal pressure on states and localities.  In addi tion, many of them have tapped financial 
reserves--or “rainy day” f unds--and pursued asset sales and other one-time actions to 
satisfy balanced budget requirements.  Noneth eless, many governments have laid off or 
furloughed workers, frozen salaries, and cut other operating expenses.  Job cuts have 
been especially pronounced at the local le vel, where payrolls have fallen roughly 
350,000, or more than 2 percent, over the past 2-1/ 2 years; nearly half of the loss of local 
jobs has been in education.   In addition, state and local governments ha ve cut their capital expenditures.  To 
be sure, construction of highways and transpor tation facilities has been well maintained 
over the past couple of years, partly because of the infrastr ucture grants and the Build 
America Bond program provided under the ARRA .  But outlays for the construction of 
schools to serve students in grades kinderg arten through 12 now stand about 30 percent 
below their pre-recession level.  One might ask why states and local ities are choosing to 
reduce capital expenditures, as these e xpenditures provide employment and economic 
benefits while typically not be ing subject to balanced budget requirements.  One reason is 
that some projects are funded at least part ially out of operating budgets and thus must 
compete with Medicaid and ot her high-priority programs for scarce dollars.  Another is

Fiscal Survey of States (Washington: NASBO, Fall).     - 4 -
that a sizable share of debt service payments on the bonds used  to finance capital projects 
comes from operating budgets, further limiti ng the flexibility and willingness of 
governments to undertake new infrastructure  projects.  Finally, starting new capital 
projects may be difficult to justify polit ically in a period of general austerity. 
At least a few states have raised taxes a nd fees to address budget shortfalls.  As 
you know, in 2009 the state of New York enacted  a package of revenue measures that 
included a temporary surcharg e on taxes paid by high-income  individuals.  California 
also raised income and sales taxes that year .  And after having seen its credit rating sink 
to among the lowest in the nation, Illinois r ecently implemented a sizable increase in 
income taxes. 
Despite the many difficult adjustments to da te, state and local fiscal repair is far 
from complete, and governors, mayors, a nd legislators will confront more tough 
decisions as they develop their budgets for fiscal year  2012.  Although the economy is 
recovering, it is still operating well belo w potential and unemployment remains high.  
Stimulus grants from the federal government  are winding down this year and will largely 
have ended by 2012.  Demands on Medicaid and ot her social service programs will likely 
remain elevated.  Moreover, reserve funds ar e low, and the list of unused one-time fixes 
has been substantially depleted.    Nonetheless, some positive developments have emerged lately.  For example, closest to home, Mayor Bloomberg announced la st month that the city of New York has 
revised up its estimates of tax revenue for both the current and upcoming fiscal years.  As 
I noted earlier, state revenue s nationwide have been ri sing recently, and states are 
generally reporting that collections are runni ng in line with--and, in some cases, a bit  - 5 -
ahead of--expectations.  Accordingly, cons iderably fewer states are facing midyear 
budget gaps that will need to be addressed befo re the end of the curr ent fiscal year than 
the 40 or so that reported such gaps in 2009 and 2010. 
Much will depend on the continuation of the economic recovery.  If the economy 
continues to strengthen at about the p ace projected by the Federal Reserve and many 
private forecasters, states and localities ma y start to get a little  breathing space.  Tax 
collections will rise with income and spendi ng, and the use of Medicaid and other income 
support programs should ease as the labor mark et improves.  However, because the pace 
of near-term economic growth expected by mo st forecasters is re latively modest given 
the depth of the downturn, some time will likel y be required before state and local fiscal 
conditions return to something approximating normal.   Continued evidence that states and lo calities are addressing fiscal shortfalls 
should help calm the municipal bond market.  Generally, that market seems to be 
functioning reasonably well.  Around the turn of the year , though, investor concerns 
about the fiscal situations of  many governments, including those of some populous states, 
resulted in increased yields on municipal bonds relative to Treasur y bonds as well as a 
widening of credit default swap spreads fo r a number of states.  Fortunately, although 
these measures of risk in the municipal bond market remain elevated, they have been 
looking somewhat better recently, presumably  reflecting expectations of continuing 
improvement in the finances of states and lo calities.  The Federal Reserve will continue 
to monitor the municipal bond market closely.    - 6 -
Longer-Run Fiscal Challenges  for States and Localities 
Although my focus thus far has been on the near term, state and local 
governments are also confronting some diffic ult fiscal challenges in the longer term.  
Indeed, with the retirement of public employees who are part of the baby-boom 
generation and the continued ri se in health-care costs, m eeting obligations for pension 
and retiree health-care expenses will become increasingly difficult for many states and localities.  Estimates of st ate and local governments’ unfunde d pension liabilities for the 
nation as a whole span a wide range, with some researchers putting the figure in the 
neighborhood of $2 trillion to $3 trillion.
2  Some governments are beginning to take 
difficult steps to address this problem, although their ability to change plan provisions is 
limited by the strong legal protect ion (including, in some states , constitutional protection) 
accorded to accrued pension benefits of public employees in many jurisdictions.3  
State and local governments also will ha ve to address the burgeoning costs of 
retiree health benefits.  Estimates of thes e costs are subject to substantially greater 
uncertainty than are those for pension liabiliti es, largely because of the difficulty inherent 
in projecting overall health-care costs decades into the future.  In addition, retiree health 
plans generally do not have the same degree of explicit protection as do pensions and 
thus may be more subject to change.   With these uncertainties in mind, the prospective 
costs of providing retiree health benefits-- though certainly conseque ntial--appear to be 
somewhat smaller than unfunded pension liabi lities.  For example, one recent estimate

generally seem to be accorded a lower level of protection.   - 7 -
suggests that state governments have a coll ective liability of al most $600 billion for 
retiree health benefits.4  
Not all of the longer-term issues facing st ate and local fiscal authorities involve 
closing budget gaps.  For example, in light of the recent experience, an important question is whether anything can be done to reduce the sensitivity of state and local 
budgets to the business cycle.  As the past couple of years have shown, the balanced-
budget rules under which most states operate can force sharp cuts in services and 
increases in taxes during recessions, which is ju st the time when many people in the state 
are economically most vulnerable.  Moreover,  the instability in funding streams and tax 
rates associated with the business cycle can impede planning by both the public and the 
private sectors. 
By and large, the evidence suggests that  balanced-budget rules provide valuable 
fiscal discipline for states, and I do not advocate eliminating them.
5  However, even with 
these rules in place, the question remains wh ether the effects of the business cycle on 
state budgets can be mitigated in the future .  One strategy used by many governments is 
to build up a rainy day fund during good econom ic times.  Measured as a percent of 
general fund expenditures, the aggregate reserve-fund balanc es for all state governments 
stood at a record 11-1/2 per cent at the end of fiscal 2006.  These comparatively high 
reserve-fund balances have lessened the sever ity of spending cuts or tax increases in 
many states during the past couple of years.  However, given the depth of the recession, 
even these historically high balances proved insufficient to fully buffer the budgets of

most states.  Thus, governments may wish to  revisit their criteria for accumulating and 
using fiscal reserves.  Build ing an adequate reserve f und during good times may not be 
politically popular, but doi ng so can pay off during bad times as well as lessen the 
tendency to overspend when times are good. 
In principle, some smoothing of expenditures over good and bad times could also 
take place through the capital budget.  In partic ular, maintaining or even increasing the 
pace of construction spending when the economy is weak could add valuable 
infrastructure and provide local jobs; it may even allow a government to get more “bang 
for the buck” because of increased compe tition among private contractors when demand 
is slack.  Voters and policymakers may unde rstandably be reluctant to approve new bond 
issues and take on additional costs for debt payments in a period of  fiscal and economic 
stress, but they might be less reluctant if governments were to accumulate larger rainy 
day funds and assign a higher prio rity to tapping them for infr astructure purposes in times 
of economic weakness.  
Another development that has compounde d the difficulties faced by many state 
governments is that their revenues--always sensitive to economic conditions--appear to 
have become even more tied to the econom y over time.  One reason for this greater 
sensitivity is that capital income, which tends  to vary substantially more than wage and 
salary income, has become an increasingly important source of state personal income 
taxes.6  Also, sales taxes may have become mo re cyclical because of an increasing 
tendency to exempt certain necessities, for wh ich demand is relatively more stable.  As

state legislatures review their tax systems, they may wish to consider steps to enhance the 
cyclical stability of their reve nue streams.  Of course, many considerations enter into tax 
policy, including the fairness of the code, th e support it provides for economic growth 
and development, and the level of administrative and compliance costs.  
Budget balance and budget stab ility are important fiscal issues.  In the long run, 
though, the most important fiscal issue is wh ether the structure and composition of the 
government budget best serves the public inte rest.  Certainly, mo st people would support 
the goal of fostering healthy economic growt h.  Government can contribute to this 
objective in a number of ways.  One critical means is by ensuring an adequate investment 
in human capital--that is, in the knowledge a nd skills of our people.  No economy can 
succeed without a high-quality workforce, pa rticularly in an ag e of globalization and 
technical change.  Cost-effective K-12 a nd post-secondary schooling are crucial to 
building a better workforce, but they are only pa rt of the story.  Re search increasingly has 
shown the benefits of earl y childhood education and effo rts to promote the lifelong 
acquisition of skills for both individuals and the economy as a whole.  The payoffs of 
early childhood programs can be especially high.7  For instance, preschool programs for 
disadvantaged children have  been shown to increase high school graduation rates.8  
Because high school graduates have higher earn ings, pay more taxes, and are less likely 
to use public health programs, investing in such programs can pay off even from the narrow perspective of state budge ts; of course, the returns to  the overall economy and to 
the individuals themselves are much greater.

Additionally, in a dynamic economy in whic h job requirements are evolving more 
rapidly than ever, individual s already in the workforce need opportunities to improve 
their skills throughout their lives.  There ar e many ways to provide such opportunities.  
For example, community colleges and vocationa l schools train and retrain workers, often 
in close collaboration with private employe rs, and in many cases they perform this 
function at a relatively low cost.  Although he lping workers acquire up-to-date skills is 
always important, it is especially critical  now, when long spells of unemployment are 
threatening the longer-term employa bility and productivity of many. 
Conclusion 
Tonight I have highlighted some of the fiscal challenge s faced by elected 
officials, both in New York and in other re gions.  In the past few years, the weak 
economy has significantly reduced government  revenues, which in turn has forced 
governments to make difficult decisions on spending and taxes.  An improving economy 
should help, but state and local finances wi ll remain under pressure for some time.  
Moreover, states and localities are facing di fficult longer-run issues related to pension 
and health-related expenses for their reti red employees.  These challenges are daunting 
indeed, but meeting them will be essential to ensuring that our resilient and dynamic 
economy delivers rising living standards to the citizens of New York and to our nation as 
a whole. ",2011-03-02,bernanke

The recent deep recession and the subsequent slow recovery have created severe 
budgetary pressures not only for many households and businesses, but for governments 
as well.  Indeed, in the United States, governments  at all levels are grappling not only 
with the near -term effects of economic weakness , but also with the longer -run pressur es 
that will be generated by the need to provide  health care and retirement security to an 
aging pop ulation .  There is no way around it --meeting these challenges  will require 
policymakers  and the public to make some very difficult decisions  and to accept  some  
sacrifices .  But  history makes clear  that countries that  continually  spend beyond their 
means  suffer slower growth in incomes and living standards  and are prone to greater 
economic and financial instability.   Conversely, good fiscal management is a cornerstone 
of sustainable growth and prosperity.  
Although state and local governments face significa nt fiscal challenges, m y 
primary focus today will be  the federal budget situation  and its economic implications .1
Fiscal Challenges    I 
will describe the factors underly ing current and projected budget deficits  and explain why 
it is crucially  important  that we put U.S. fisca l policy on a sustainable path.  I will also 
offer some thoughts on whether new fiscal rules or institutions might help promote a 
successful transition to fiscal sustainability  in the United States .   
The budgetary position of  the federal  government  has deteriorated substantially  
during  the past two fiscal years , with the budget deficit averaging 9- 1/2 percent of 
national income during that time .  For comparison, the deficit averaged 2 percent  of

national  income for the  fiscal years 2005 t o 2007, prior to the onset of the recession and 
financial crisis .  The recent  deterioratio n was largely the result of  a sharp decline in tax 
revenues brought about by the recession and the subsequent slow recovery, as well as by  
increases in federal spendi ng needed  to alleviate  the recession and st abilize  the financial 
system .  As a result  of these deficits , the accumulated  federal debt measured relative  to 
national income has increased to a level not seen since the aftermath of World War II.  
For now, the budget deficit has stabilized and, so long  as the economy  and 
financial markets continue  to recover , it should narrow  relative to national income  over 
the ne xt few years .  Economic conditions provide little scope for reduc ing deficits 
significantly further  over the next year or two; indeed, premature fiscal tightening  could 
put the recovery at risk.  Over  the medium - and long -term, however, the story is quite  
different.  If current p olicy settings  are maintained,  and under reasonable assumptions 
about economic growth,  the federal budget will be  on an unsustainable path in coming 
years , with  the ratio of federal debt held by the public to national income rising at an 
increasing pace.2
                                                 
2 For example, see the alternative fiscal scenario in the Congressional Budget Office (2010), The Long-
Term Budget Outlook  (Washington:  CBO, June (revised August)), available at 
www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=11579&zzz=40884.  Stabilizing the ratio of federal debt to national income 
requires that spending on everything other than interest payments on the debt be brought into rough 
alignment with tax revenues over time.  Equivalently, the so -called primary budget deficit (the budget 
deficit exclusive of interest payments) must be reduced to zero.    Moreover, as the national debt grows , so will the associated interest 
payments, which in turn will lead to further  increases in projected deficits.   Expectation s 
of large  and increasing  deficits in the future  could inhibit current household and business 
spending --for example, by reducing confidence in the longer -term prospec ts for the 
economy or  by increasing uncertainty about future tax burdens and government 
spending --and thus restrain the recovery .  Concerns about the government’s long -run  - 3 - 
fiscal position may  also constrain the flexibility of fiscal policy to respond to cu rrent 
economic conditions .  Accordingly, steps taken today to improve the country’s longer -
term fiscal position  would not only help secure longer -term economic and financial 
stability, they  could also improve  the near -term economic outlook.  
Our fiscal challenges are especially  daunting because they are mostly the product 
of powerful underlying trends, not short -term or temporary factors.  Two of the most 
important driving forces  are the aging of the U.S. population, the pace of  which  will 
intensify over the next couple of decades as the baby -boom generation retires , and rapidly  
rising health -care costs .  As the health -care needs of the aging population increase , 
federal health -care programs are on track to be  by far the biggest single  source of fiscal 
imbalances over the longer term.  Indeed, the Congressional Budget Office  (CBO) 
projects that the ratio of federal spending for health -care programs  (principally Medicare 
and Medicaid)  to national income  will double over the next 25 years , and continue to ris e 
significantly  further after that .3
The aging of the U.S. population will also strain Social Security , as the number of 
work ers paying taxes into the system rises more slowly tha n the number of people 
receiving benefits.  This year , there are about five individuals  between the ages of 20 and 
64 for each person age d 65 and older.  By 2030, when most of the baby boomers will 
have retired , this ratio is projected to decline  to around 3, and it may subsequently fall yet   The ability to c ontrol health- care costs  as our population 
gets older , while still providing high -quality care to those who need it , will be critical not 
only for budgetary reasons but for maintaining the dynamism of the broader economy as 
well.

further as life expectancies  continue to increase.  Overall, t he projected fiscal pressures 
associated with Social Security are considerably smaller than  the pressures associated 
with federal health programs, but they s till prese nt a significant challenge to 
policy makers.  
The same underlying trends affecting federal finances will also put substantial 
pressures on state and local budgets, as organizations like yours have helped to 
highlight .4  In Rhode Island, as in other states, t he retirement of state employees , together 
with continuing increases in health- care costs , will cause public pension and retiree 
health -care obligations to become increasingly difficult to meet .  Estimates of unfunded 
pension liabilities for the states as whole span a wide range, but some researchers put t he 
figure as high as $2 trillion  at the end of 2009.5  Estimates of states’ liabilities for retiree 
health benefits are  even more uncertain  because of the difficulty of project ing medical  
costs decades into the future.  However, one recent estimate suggests that state governments have a collective liability of almost $600 billion for retiree health benefits.
6
It may be scant comfort, but the United States is not alone in facing fiscal 
challenges .  The global recession has dealt a blow to the fiscal positions of m ost other 
advanced economies , and , as in the United States,  their e xpenditures for public health   
These health  benefits have usua lly been handled on a pay -as-you-go basis and the refore 
could impose  a substantial fiscal burden in coming years as large numbers of state 
workers retire.

care and pensions are expected to rise substantially in the coming decades  as their 
populations age .7  Indeed, the population of the United State s overall is younger than 
those  of a number of European countries  as well as Japan .8
The Need for Fiscal Sustainability      
Let me return to the issue  of longer -term fiscal sustainability.  As I have 
discussed, projections by the CBO and others show future budget deficits and debts rising 
indefinitely , and at increasing rates.  To be sure, projections  are to some degree only  
hypothetical exercises .  Almost by definition, unsustainable trajectories of deficits and 
debts will never actually transpire, because creditors would never be willing to lend to a 
country in which the fiscal debt relative to the national income is rising without limit.  Herbert Stein, a  wise economist , once said, “ If something cannot  go on forever , it will 
stop.”

7 See International Monetary Fund (2010), Navigating the Fiscal Challenges Ahead, IMF Fiscal Monitor 
Series (Washington:  IMF, May), available at www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fm/2010/fm1001.pdf    One way or the other, fiscal  adjustments  sufficient  to stabilize the federal budget 
will certainly occur  at some point .  The only real question is whether these adjustments 
will take place  through a careful and deliberative process that weighs priorities and gives 
people plenty  of time to adjust to changes  in government programs or tax policies , or 
whether the needed fiscal adjustments  will be  a rapid and painful response to a looming 
or actual fiscal crisis.   Although the choices and tradeoffs  necessary to achiev e fiscal 
sustai nability  are difficult indeed , surely it is better to make these choices deliberatively  
and thoughtful ly. 
8 For example, see Neil Howe and Richard Jackson (2003), The 2003 Aging Vulnerability Index  
(Washington:  Center for Strategic and International Studies and Watson Wyatt Worldwide, March), 
available at http://csis.org/publication/2003 -aging- vulnerability -index.

Arguably, the  imperative  to achieve long -term fiscal sustainability is an 
opportunity as well as a challenge.  O pportunities for both taxing  and spending reforms 
are ample.  For example, most people agree that the U.S. tax code is  less efficient and 
less equitable than it might  be; moreover, the code is excessively  complex and impos es 
heavy administrative  and compliance costs .  Collecting revenues  through a more 
efficient, better -designed tax system  could improve economic growth and make 
achieving sustainable fiscal policies  at least  somewhat easier .  Likewise, many federal 
spending  programs doubtless could be reformed to achieve their stated objec tives more 
effectively and at lower cost.  Certainly, continued efforts to reduce health -care costs  and 
government health spending , while continuing to ensure appropriate care for those who 
need it , should be a top priority.  
Failing to  address our unsustai nable fiscal situation exposes our country  to serious 
economic costs and risks.   In the short run, as I have noted, concerns and uncertainty 
about exploding future deficits could make households, businesses , and investors  more 
cautious about spending, capi tal investment, and hiring .  In the longer term, a  rising level 
of government debt  relative to national income  is likely to put upward pressure on 
intere st rates and thus inhibit capital formation , productivity, and economic growth.  
Larger government deficits increase our reliance on foreign lenders, all else being equal, 
implying that the share  of U.S. national income devoted to paying interest to foreign 
investors  will increase over time .  Income paid to foreign investors is not a vailable for 
domestic consumption or investment.  And an increasingly large cost of servicing a 
growing national debt means that the adjustments, when t hey come, could be sharp and 
disruptive.  For example, large tax increases that might be imposed to cove r the rising  - 7 - 
interest on the debt would slow potential growth by reducing incentives to work, save, 
hire, and invest.  Finally, a large federal debt decreases  the flexibility of policy makers to 
temporarily increase spending as needed to address future emer gencies, such as 
recessions, wars, or natural disasters.   
It would be difficult to identify a specific  threshold at which federal debt  begin s to 
pose more  substantial costs  and risks  to the nation’s economy .  Perhaps no bright line 
exists; the costs and risks may grow more or less continuously as the federal debt rises.  What we do know, however, is that the threat to our economy is real and growing, which should be sufficient reason for f iscal policy makers  to put in place a  credible plan for 
bring ing deficits down to sustainable levels  over the medium term .  The sooner a plan is 
established , the longer affected individual s will have to p repare  for the necessary 
changes.   Indeed, in the past, long lead times have helped make necessary  adjustments  
less painful and thus  politically feasible.   For example, the gradual step -up in the full 
retirement age for Social Security was enacted in 198 3, but it did not begin to take effect 
until 2003 and will not be completed until 20 27, thus giving future retirees ample time to 
adjust their plans for work, saving, and ret irement.   
Fiscal Rules  
 Amid all of the uncertainty surrounding the long -term e conomic and budgetary 
outlook, one certainty is that  both current and future Congresses and Presidents will have 
to make some very tough decisions to put the budget back on a sustainable trajectory.  
 Can these tough decisions be made easier  for our  elected leaders ?  At various 
times, some U.S. Congresses and foreign governme nts have adopted fiscal rules to help 
structure the budget process.  Fiscal rules are legislative agreements intended to promote  - 8 - 
fiscal responsibility by constraining  decisions about spending and taxes.  For example, 
fiscal rules may impose constraints on key budget aggregates, such as total government 
expenditures, deficits, or debt.  In the remainder of my remarks I will discuss  the use of 
fiscal rules  to address longer -term budget problems , beginning with a review of the U.S. 
and foreign experience.  
The United States has seen several attempts to apply fiscal rules, with mixed 
results.  In 1985, the Congress enacted the Gramm -Rudman- Hollings law  which, among 
other things, specified a target path for the federal deficit,  including the elimination of the 
deficit by 1991.  However, the target path proved to be unattainable, and eventually the 
entire structure was abandoned.  One problem with this approach was that its primary 
focus and measure of success was the current budget deficit.  Although the emphasis on the current deficit was understandable, the approach ran aground of the fact that the budget deficit is driven not only by the choices of the Congress , but also by the 
performance of the economy.  If the economy is strong, for example, the deficit is almost bound to improve , as tax revenues increase and spending on the social safety net 
decreases ; conversely, if the economy weakens, the deficit is likely to rise, 
notwithstanding prior efforts by the Congress to better manage government spending and taxes.    
With fiscal concerns still prominent, in 1990 the Congress and the Preside nt 
adopted a new approach, with two key elements .  First, t his alternative approach capped 
the level of discretionary federal spending --that is,  the spending subject to annual 
appropriations, including defense and nondefense purchases of goods and services.  
Second, it  imposed a pay -as-you-go (PAYGO)  rule on tax revenues and mandatory  - 9 - 
spending , which is spending that continues automatically without an annual 
reauthorization; entitlement spending such as Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security 
makes  up most of this category.  The PAYGO rule required that any tax  reduction or 
mandatory spending  increase be “paid for” with offsetting tax hikes or spending cuts, so 
that projected deficits  over the 5-  and 10- year horizons  would not be worsened.  
Supported importantly by  the strong economic growth of the 1990s, these rules  are seen 
by many observers as having helped put  the deficit on a declining path ; indeed, the 
federal government generated a few  annual surpluses.  The discretionary spending caps 
and the PAYGO rule were allowed to expire after the 2001 fiscal year, in part because concerns about deficits we re waning at the time.  
Currently, the Congress operates under more -limited PAYGO rules.  The rules 
require that offsets  for spending increases or tax cuts must be found within a 10- year 
budget horizon, but they  also exempt a number of significant tax and s pending programs.  
Putting aside these details of implementation, given current budgetary challenges, the key question is whether the traditional PAYGO approach is sufficiently ambitious.  A t its 
best, PAYGO prevent s new tax cuts and mandatory spending inc reases from making 
projected budget deficits worse; by construction, PAYGO does not require the Congress  
to reduce the ever -increasing deficits that are already built into current law.  
 Many other countries have experience with fiscal rules.   The European Union, by 
treaty,  established  fiscal rules  in the early 1990s, with the goal of ensuring that all 
members would maintain sustainable fiscal policies.  The rules specified that countries should keep their government deficits at or below 3 percent of their g ross domestic 
products (GDP) , and that government debt should not exceed 60 percent of GDP.  Even  - 10 - 
before the recent financial crisis and recession, however, the enforcement mechanisms  
for these rules  did not prevent these targets from being bre ached , and fiscal problems in 
several euro-area countries have recently been a source of financial and economic stress.  
European leaders are working to strengthen their tools for enforcing fiscal discipline.   
 Although fiscal rules have not be en panaceas in t he United States or the euro area 
as a whole, a number of other economies , in Europe and elsewhere, seemed to have found 
fiscal rules to be helpful  in achiev ing greater budget discipline.  For example, 
Switzerland, Sweden, Finland, and the Netherlands all realized  improvements in their 
fiscal situations after adopting rules that limit spending.  Canada saw improvement in its deficit after it implemented spending   limits in the early 1990s, and its ratio of public debt 
to national income fell substantially a fter 1998 when it put in place a “balanced budget or 
better” rule.   A number of emerging  market nations, such as Chile, have also applied 
fiscal rules with some success.  According to the International Monetary Fund, about 80 countries currently are subject to national or supranational fiscal rules.
10
Clearly, a fiscal rule does not guarantee improve d budget outcomes; after all, any 
rule imposed by a legislature can be revoked or circumvented by the same legislature.  However, although not all countries with fiscal rules have achieved lower deficits and debt, the weight of the evidence suggests that well -designed rules can help promote 
improved fiscal performance.  
11
                                                 
10 See the International Monetary Fund (2009), Fiscal Rules --Anchoring Expectations for Sustainable 
Public Finances  (Washington:  IMF, December), available at 
www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2009/121609.pdf .   I will discuss f our factors that seem likely to increase 
their effectiveness.  
11 See IMF, Fiscal Rules , in note 10.   - 11 - 
First, effective rules must be transparent .  By shining a light on the problem and 
the range of feasible solutions, transparent  policy rules  clarify the  budget  choices that 
must be made , help the public understand those choices, and encourage policymakers to 
recognize the broader fiscal consequences of their decisions  on individual programs.  In 
particular, transparent fiscal rules may help solve what economists refer to as a collective 
action problem.  When faced with spending decisions, most  elected representatives want 
to be seen as garner ing the greatest possible benefit  for their constituents.  But if a prior 
agreement limits  the size of the available pie, it may be easier to negotiate outcomes in 
which everyone accepts a little bit less.   Of course, tr ansparency is enhanced by good 
watchdogs.  In the United States, the nonpartisan CBO  has ably served that role since 
1974.  Nongovernmental  organizations that focus on budget issues , such as nonprofit 
think tanks, can also promote  transparency.  
  Second, a n effective rule must be sufficiently ambitious to address the underlying 
problem.  As I mentioned, PAYGO rules, even when effective, were designed only to avoid making the fiscal situation worse; they did not attack large and growing structural deficits.   In the current U.S. context, we should consider adopting a rule, or at least a 
clearly articulated plan, consistent with  achieving long -term fiscal sustainability.  
Admittedly, an  important difficulty with developing rules for long -term fiscal 
sustainabil ity in the United States is that, given the importance of health -care spending in 
the federal budget, the CBO would need to forecast health -care costs  and the potential 
effects of alternative policy measures on those costs  well into the future .  Such 
forecasting is very difficult.  However, any plan to address long -term U.S. fiscal issues,  - 12 - 
whether or not in the context of a fiscal rule, would have to contend with forecast 
uncertainties . 
Third, rules seem to be more effective when they focus on variables that the 
legislature can control directly, as opposed to factors  that are largely beyond its  control .  
For example, as I noted, actual budget deficits depend on spending and taxation decisions but also on the state of the economy.  As a result, when a target for the deficit or the debt is missed, ascribing responsibility may be difficult.  Current c ongressional procedures 
generally require the CBO to “score” proposed spending and tax programs for their budget effects over a specified, longer -term horizon;  this approach, although not without 
its problems, has the advantage of linking budget targets directly to legislative decisions.  
 Fourth, and perhaps most fundamentally, fiscal rules cannot substitute for political 
will, which means that public understanding of and support for the rules are critical.  For 
example,  the fiscal rules that Switzerland adopted in 2001 had overwhelming popular 
support ; the widespread support no doubt  contributed to their success in helping to reduce 
that country’s ratio of publi c debt to national income.  Conversely, i n the absence of  
public support and commitment from elected leaders , fiscal rules may ultimately have 
little effect on budget outcomes.   Educating the public about the consequences of 
unsustainable fiscal policies may be one way to help build that support.  
Conclusion  
Today I have  highlighted our nation’s fiscal challenges .  In the past few years, the 
recession and the financial crisis, along with the policy actions taken to buffer the ir 
effects, have eroded our fiscal situation.  An improving economy should reduce near -term 
deficits , but our public  finances are nevertheless  on an unsustainable path in the longer  - 13 - 
term, reflecting in large part our aging population and the continual  rise in health -care 
costs .  We should not underestimate these fiscal challenges ; failing to respond  to them  
would endanger our economic future.  
Well -designed fiscal rules cannot substitute for  the political will to take  difficult 
decisions, but U.S. and international experience su ggests that they can be helpful to 
legislators  in certain circumstances .  Indeed, installing a fiscal rule could provide an 
important signal to the public that the Congress is serious about achieving long -term 
fiscal sustainability, which  itself would be g ood for  confidence.  A fiscal rule could also 
focus and institutionalize  political support for fiscal  responsibility .  Given the importance 
of achieving long -term fiscal stability, further discussion of fiscal rules and frameworks 
seems well warranted.   ",2010-10-04,bernanke

Supporting Innovation with Guardrails: T he Federal Reserve’s  Approach to Supervision 
and Regulation of Banks’ Crypto -related Activities

I’m here today  to discuss what we have learned from the recent turmoil in the 
crypto sector  and what role supervision and regulati on should play in helping banks  
manage their engagement with the sector and the innovative technologies that support it .  
Despite  recent  events, we have not lost sight of the potential  transformative effect that 
these technologies  could have  on our  financial system .  And we need to be careful lest 
regulation lock in the power of incumbents or stifle innovation.   But the benefits of 
innovation can only be realized if appropriate guardrails are in place .  I am going to talk 
about how we are working to provide clarity to the banks we supervise about what we 
have learned and  about  our supervisory expectations .  I will wrap up by sharing some 
thoughts on stablecoins .1   
It isn’t hard to find evidence for the need to  discuss cry pto, but let me start with a 
recent personal experience .  Last month, I visited the Mississippi Delta to talk about 
financial inclusion and community development, and I spent a morning talking with a 
group of college students.  When I asked, it turned out that most of  the student s I met 
owned some crypto -assets.  This surprised me  because  in my experience as a professor , 
most  college students are usually strapped for cash .  What didn’t surprise me is that many 
of those  who said they owned  crypto -assets also said they had lost money, and they 
weren’t very happy about that.   
It was a reminder for me that crypto -assets aren’t  just held by people  with ample 
money for speculation .  A fifth of Americans, many of them with limited savings , say

they have owned some form of crypto .2  The problems that have come to light in the 
crypto sector over the past year  may have affected a large segment of the public .  
When I think about how to approach crypto-assets , the technology behind them, 
and the interaction between the crypto sector and traditional financial system, I find it 
helpful to place recent innovation in historical context .  Innovation in financial markets 
has long raised  questions about the appropria te role of regulation .  Of particular concern 
is how  the regulat ory framework  can serve both to encourage innovation and  to support 
the safety and soundness of financial institutions  and broader financial stability .  Just as 
important is the need to  protect  the public from fraud and other abusive behavior .   
The challenge here begins with a mismatch in timing.  Innovation often comes 
quickly, but it takes time for  consumers to become aware that they could both gain and 
lose money on new financial products .  It may take time for market participants to  
understand attendant risks and come up with tools  to manage them .  Likewise, r egulation 
involves a deliberative process —as it should  because it needs to balance the risk that 
over-regulation will stifle innovation with the risk that under -regulation will allow  for 
substantial harm  to households and the financial system .   
Long before crypto became an issue for regulation and public policy, I  was 
grapp ling with how to think about the cycle of innovation in the context of the Global 
Financial Crisis.  New products  often develop  slowly at first while market participants are 
unsure of their value or their risks, but excitement and enthusiasm can then lead to rapid

growth  and new products flood the  market  as a result .3  Participants assume too quickly 
that they know how the new products work, and novel products can appear both safe and 
lucrative,  particularly  if they have not been tested through bouts of market stress.  The 
innovation cycle turns when this mismatch —between  perceived understanding of risk 
and actual underlying risk—becomes  apparent.   
Back then,  I was talking about  some of the causes and consequences of the 
financial crisis.  At that time, new types of financial products had become so intertwined 
with the banking and broader financial system that the turn in the innovation cycle 
resulted in devastating consequences for homeowners, workers, businesses, and our 
economy.   Today, w hile the crypto-asset sector is more nascent  and less pervasive , the 
questions about how new financial products will affect the public, the economy, and financial stability are similar.  Innovation surges ahead, and regulation follows, trying to 
balance benefits and risks.   
The Potential Benefits of Innovative  Technologies  
 Before I get into how we are responding to developments in the crypto sector in 
our approach to supervision and regulation, I want to recognize the potential public benefits of the technologies underlying  crypto -assets.  It is often argued that the se 
technologies  will have extensive beneficial application beyond crypto-assets themselves.  
The payments system is critical to everyday Americans.  It is highly resilient but 
also can be slow and expensive.  This is particularly true with respect to cross -border 
payments.   The technology underlying crypto assets —including  that which enables  
programmability —could bring new functionality or efficiencies to  payments system s.

actions,  creating  further  efficiencies.   Such  use of t he technology could lead t o potential

In contrast to the p otential bene fits of t hese technologies, ther e is the actual 
experience of  the many people whose hope and enthusiasm fo r crypto-assets have met 
with disappointment and  sometimes devastating loss.  Robert Shiller d escribes how

same  fundamental  liquidity and credit risks as  traditional assets , and can be highly 
correlated with other traditional risks, rather than being hedges against such risks . 
While purveyors  of crypto -assets have represented to customers that they ar e 
protected through the decentralized nature of  the underlying technology, customers are 
often a t a greater risk because those purveyors  often find ways to function outside a 
robust supervisory and  regulatory system.   In the absence  of regulatory compliance , 
customers don’t have the information they need to assess and mitigate their risks .  
Investors do not have the  structural protections they have  relied on for many decades.   As 
a result, many h ave been victims of classic  cases of fraud and abuse—some appropriately 
classified as  “Ponzi schemes ” under a high-tech veneer.   Moreover, while crypto -assets 
are hyped as “decentralized ,” there has been an emergence of new , quite centralized  
intermediaries that are either not subject to  or not compliant with appropriate regulation 
and supervision, which has perpetuated harm to consumers .  Complicating matters 
further, these entities often seek out jurisdictions with loose or less developed legal and 
regulatory frameworks for financial activities .  And the  lack of consolidated home 
country supervision and coordination with host country supervisors rekindle s the kind of 
abuses that bank regulators long ago quashed .  While such cross jurisdictional regulatory 
arbitrage is not new , the digital nature of these activities  provides for greater opportunity 
to expand the reach of such entities  to customers around the world.  
For example, the prominent  collapse of the  FTX crypto -asset  trading platform has 
reportedly wiped out the holdings of a million people, costing  them billions of dollars.6

  - 6 - 
Unfortunately, t hat is not the only example.   Since last summer , we saw the collapse of 
one crypto intermediary  after another.7  As these cases are work ing their way through the 
bankruptcy courts, we are seeing indications of misuse of client funds, 
misrepresentations , obfuscation  about availability of deposit insurance , and potential 
fraud.  
Crypto has also been implicated in numerous cases of illicit financ ing.  Crypto -
assets pose significant money laundering and terrorism financing risks due to the 
pseudonymous actors  that are parties to  transactions , the ease and speed of transfer, and 
the general irrevocability of transactions —all of which make crypto -assets attractive for 
use in money laundering  and terrorist financing .  Indeed, enforcement  agencies —
including the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network , the Office of F oreign Assets 
Control , and the Department of Justice —have taken numerous public enforcement  
actions against entities or individuals dealing in crypto -assets.8 
This kind of behavior can cause substantial harm to investors and consumers  as 
well as  to our financial system .  The federal bank  regulatory  agencies, including the 
Federal Reserve Board , have a statutory responsibility to ensure that the activity of the 
entities we supervise is conducted in a safe and sound manner, and in compliance with all 
applicable laws.  While the  effects of the events i n the crypto sector on Federal Reserve-

supervised banks have been limited in the aggregate thus far , recent experience has made 
it clear that crypto could pose risks to th ose banks .  In response, we have worked with the 
other federal bank  regulatory  agencies  to provide clarity and guidance on what is 
permissible , safe and sound, and compliant with anti -money-laundering and anti -terrorist 
financing laws as well as consumer and investor protections.  And we’ve set out  our 
supervisory expectat ions for banks engaging  with new product types and activities.   As 
noted above,  this is not just a domestic issue.  We are also work ing with our international 
counterparts to minimize  the possibility  of regulatory arbitrage across jurisdictions.   
The Fede ral Reserve’s  Approach to Supervising Banks ’ Engagement with Crypto  
One overarching principle of the Federal Reserve’s financial oversight is that 
activities that are fundamentally the same should be  regulated the same, regardless of 
where or how the activ ity occurs  or the terms used to describe the activity.   We have a 
somewhat complicated financial services regulatory framework  in the U nited States , and 
there are several regulatory authorities with oversight of financial services activities .  But 
we know how important it is for entities interested in providing financial services with 
new technologies to engage on a level playing field.  That is why we have worked closely 
with the other bank regulatory agencies  to develop a consistent approach.   Our overall 
stance is that , at this stage of the development , banks  should take a careful and cautious 
approach to engaging in  crypto-asset related activities  and the crypto sector .   
Overview of R ecent Federal Reserve A ctions  
Over decades, federal bank regulators have articulated supervisory expectations 
for managing, monitoring, and controlling risks to safety and soundness.  These 
expectations are generally principles -based —meaning they can be applied in a broad  - 8 - 
range of circumstances.  Given  emerging interest in crypto -asset activities , we have 
worked to provide  clear and transparent guidance .  Last August , we published a 
supervisory guidance  letter for banks engaging in or seeking to engage in crypto-related 
activities.9  In the letter, we reminded firms that the first step when  considering engaging 
in crypto-related activities  is to establish that the activities are legally permissible , and 
that there are sufficient controls in place to ensure these  activities can be conducted in  a 
safe and sound manner and in compliance with all applicable laws .  Against the 
background of possible crimes that some crypto companies are now under investigation 
for, this is not a box-checking exercise.  O ur letter also  lets banks know that they are 
expected to notify the Federal Reserve  if they intend to engage in crypto-asset related 
activities  and to engage in a robust supervisory conversation.  
The letter  said, in effect, “Don’t jump in and plan  to figure out risk management 
later.”  It stated  that “Federal Reserve-supervised banking organizations should have 
adequate systems and controls in place to conduct crypto-asset -related activities in a safe 
and sound manner prior to commencing such activities.”  
In the ensuing months, a lot happened in the crypto world,  including the turmoil 
discussed earlier .  On January 3, after l earning from these developments, the Board and 
other bank regulatory  agencies issued another statement advising banks  to be focused on 
 
9  SR 22 -6 / CA 22 -6, “Engagement in Crypto -Asset -Related Activities by  Federal Reserve -Supervised 
Ba nking Orga nizations ,” https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/SR2206.htm .  - 9 - 
a list of several key  risks .10  The list ranges from  the risk of fraud and scams of crypto 
participants  to money laundering and terrorist financing,  to stablecoin run risks.11  
Later in January, the Board issued a policy statement making it clear  to the banks  
we sup ervise that the Board  would apply the same permissibility standards  to activities, 
including crypto-asset -related activities , regardless of  a bank’s  deposit insurance status .12  
The preamble to the statement made  clear that  we would likely view it as unsafe and 
unsound for  banks to directly own crypto -assets on the ir balance sheet s.  In addition, we 
clarified  that the banks  we supervise  seeking to iss ue stablecoins or dollar tokens  would 
have to show that they  have controls in place to do so in a safe and sound manner and 
that they would need to obtain a non-objection notice from Federal Reserve supervisors 
before proceeding.    
On February 23, we provided additiona l clarity about  supervisory expectations 
through another statement issued jointly with other bank  regulatory  agencies .13  This 
statement was also informed by recent supervisory experience.   The statement  
highlighted to our supervised institutions that they need to be aware of the liquidity risks 
associated with certain crypto sector -affiliated d eposits.  We always expect banks to

11 The eight specific risks highlighted a re as follows: (1) the risk of fraud or scams among crypto 
pa rticipants;  (2) legal uncertainty about custody practices, redemptions, and ownership rights; (3) crypto 
companies claiming they carry deposit insurance; (4) volatility in crypto a sset values; (5) run risk from

assess and manage the liquidity risks of their funding sources.  As the statement makes 
clear —and as has been obvious throughout the last few months —crypto sector deposit ors 
may have assets that can be affected by volatility  in the sector .  This volatility can  lead to 
unpredictable , rapid , and correlated  deposit  inflows  and withdrawals , and thus the 
liquidity risks of their deposits , of course , require some additional atte ntion .  These 
liquidity concerns  are partic ularly acute for banks that have a meaningful portion of their 
balance sheets funded with such deposits.     
Again, we took these steps to make clear that we have the same expectations for 
all the institutions that we supervise and which seek to engage in novel activities.  These 
expectations are not new.  We expect supervised entities to ensure that they conduct  their 
activities in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with all relevant laws, including 
anti-money-laundering laws.   These public statements are transparen t and provide the 
same  information for everyone, including for small banks that may not have  large teams 
of analysts assessing industry developments , large banks with more resources, and,  of 
course , the public .  We plan to continue to publish guidance of this kind as we continue 
to examine activity in the sector .   
In addition to sharing what we learn with the public on an ongoing basis , we are 
also enhancing our supervision of these activities.   We are creating a specialized team of 
experts  that can help us learn from new developments and make sure we’re up to date on 
innovation in this sector.  
Special Risks Associated  with Stablecoins  
I want to wrap up today by talking about stablecoins.   As Chair Powell has said , 
stablecoins are a type of private money, and there  is a long and messy history of private  - 11 - 
money in the United States that shows the n eed for robust  regulation and oversight.14  
Any entity issuing money denominated in the U.S. dollar  and drawing on the trust  of the 
Federal Reserve needs to  be subject to  federal prudential regulation and supervision.   I 
am not saying anything new here.  This has been our consistent approach . 
Stablecoin issuers seek to have —but don’t —some of the same characteristics as 
federally insured bank deposits.  Stablecoin issuers represent that their liabilities can be 
redeemed on demand at par, a dollar for a dollar.  In fact, however, the assets backing the 
liability can fluctuate in value.  Even if the assets backing the claim are high quality, they 
cannot necessarily be immediately monetized , and operational risks are quite high.   As 
we have seen all too often, depositors sometimes want or need their money immediately, 
especially in times of stress.  This mismatch in value and liquidity is the recipe for a 
classic bank run.  Issuers are not supervised by the Fed  and lack capit al and liquidity as a 
backstop.   The banks we regulate, in contrast, are well  protected from bank runs through 
a robust array of supervisory requirements.  
Consider the consequences if a stablecoin not subject to appropriate supervision 
and regulation were  to be  adopted as a  widespread means of payment, which some 
stablecoin developers state as a goal .  Stablecoins have the potential to scale quickly 
because of network effects. A n unregulated, unsupervised, deposit -like asset  could create 
tremendous disrupt ions, not just for financial institutions but for people who might rely 
on the coin  if it were to  get wide adoption.  We must  learn from the past to ensure that we

do not allow for new forms of  unregulated private money subject to classic forms of  run 
risk, and with the associated spillovers and systemic implications  for households, 
businesses,  and the broader economy .  
Conclusion 
That gets me back to the central point of my remarks, which is the need to bal ance 
innovation with safeguards.  Our goal is to create guardrails, while making room for 
innovation that can benefit consumers and the financial system more broadly.  We are 
working with the other bank regulatory  agencies to consider whether and how certain 
crypto-asset activity  can be conducted in a manner that is consistent with safe and sound 
banking.  We are also working toward providing additional clarity on our views of risks 
and effective risk management practices across a range of crypto -related activity.  We 
will continue to be transparent with the banking sector and the public about our 
expectations.  We will also work with the other agencies to align our approach to ensure 
that the same risks receive the same treatment . As we continue our efforts , we will work 
to support innovation by establishing the guardrails essential for sustainable, safe, and 
transparent markets .  Thank you.

February 28, 2019 
  
It is a pleasure to speak here this evening at the 87 th Awards Dinner.  Tonight I 
will start with the near- term outlook for the U.S. economy.  Then I will turn to a topic 
that is inspired by the Citizens Budget Commission’s mission statement, which focuses 
on the “well -being of future New Yorkers.”  I imagine that future New Yorkers attending 
this dinner in 50 years may not look back on the near -term outlook in February 2018 as 
very interesting or important.  So, tonight, after a brief review of the here and now, I will 
focus on an issue that is likely to be of more lasting im portance:  the need for policies that 
will support and encourage participation in the labor force, promote longer -term growth 
in our rapidly evolving economy, and spread the benefits of prosperity as widely as 
possible.   
The State of the Economy and Near -Term Prospects  
Beginning with the here and now, Congress has charged the Federal Reserve with 
achieving maximum employment and stable prices, two objectives that together are 
called the dual mandate.  I am pleased to say that, judged against these goals, t he 
economy is in a good place.  The current economic expansion has been under way for 
almost 10 years.  This long period of growth has pushed the unemployment rate down 
near historic lows (figure 1).   The employment gains have been broad based across all 
racial and ethnic groups and all levels of educational attainment as well as among the 
disabled (figure 2).1  And while the unemployment rate for African Americans and 
Hispanics remains above the rates for whites and Asians, the disparities have narrowed 
appreciably as the economic expansion has continued.  
                                                 
1 The unemployment rate of those with a disability and between the ages of 16 and 64 fell from more than 
16 percent in 2011 to less than 9 percent in 2018.  Meanwhile, their labor force partic ipation rate has been 
rising over the past few years.  In 2018, about 8 percent of the population aged 16 to 64 reported 
themselves as having a disability, and their labor force participation rate was 33 percent.   - 2 - 
Nearly all job market indicators are better than a few years ago, and many are at 
their most favorable levels in decades.  After lagging earlier in the expansion, wages and 
overall compensation--pay plus benefits --are now growing faster than a few years ago 
(figure 3).  It is especially encouraging that the labor force participation rate of people in 
their prime working years, ages 25 to 54, has been rising for the past three years.  More 
plentiful jobs and rising wages are drawing more people into the workforce and 
encouraging others who might have left to stay.   
In addition, business -sector productivity growth, which had been disappointing 
during the expansion, moved up in the first three quarters of 2018.  Rising productivity 
allows wages to increase without adding to inflation pressures.  Sustained productivity 
growth is a necessary ingredient for longer -run improvements in living standards.   
The price stability side of our mandate is also in a good place.  After remaining 
below our target for several years, inflation by our prefe rred measure averaged roughly 
2 percent last year (figure 4).  Inflation has softened a bit since then, largely reflecting the 
recent drop in oil prices.  Futures markets and other indicators suggest that oil prices are 
unlikely to fall further, and if this proves correct, oil’s drag on overall inflation will 
subside.  Consistent with that view, core inflation, which excludes volatile food and 
energy prices and often provides a better signal of where inflation is heading, is currently 
running just a touch below our 2 percent objective.  S igns of upward pressure on inflation 
appear muted despite the strong labor market.   
While the data I have discussed so far give a favorable picture of the economy, it 
is also important to acknowledge that not everyone has shared in the benefits of the 
expansion to the same extent, and that too many households still struggle to make ends  - 3 - 
meet.2  In addition, over the past few months  we have seen some crosscurrents and 
conflicting signals about the near -term outlook.  For instance, growth has slowed in some 
major economies, particularly China and Europe.  Uncertainty  is elevated around some  
unresolved government policy issues, including Brexit  and ongoing trade negotiations .  
And f inancial conditions have tightened since last fall .  While most of the incoming 
domestic economic data have been solid, some surveys of business and consumer 
sentiment have moved lower .  Unexpectedly weak retail sales data for December also 
give reason for caution.  
Given the positive outlook but also muted inflation pressures and the 
crosscurrents I just mentioned, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will be 
patient as we determine what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds 
rate may be appropriate to support our dual -mandate objectives.   This common- sense 
risk-management approach has served the Committee well in the past.   
I will turn now from the near- term outlook to the question of how the economy 
will perform over the long haul.   
Longer -Term Challenges and Opportunities  
From 1991 through 2007, the economy expanded annually at about 3 percent, 
similar to the pace for much of second half of the 20th century.  Since 2007, however, 
growth has averaged just 1.6 percent.  If the earlier 3 percent growth had persisted over 
the past 12 years, incomes today woul d be almost 20 percent higher than they now are.  
                                                 
2 For example, a Federal Reserve survey indicates that in early 2018 , after nearly a decade of growth , as 
many as 40  percent of households were unprepared for an emergency expense of as little as $400.  Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2018 ), Report on the Economic Well -Being of U.S. Households  
(Washington:  Board of Governors , May) , available at  
https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/ other20180522a.htm .  - 4 - 
From the standpoint of future Americans, if the slower growth persists for a half -century, 
incomes will end up roughly half of what they would have been.  
Why has growth slowed, and what can we do about it?   To understand the causes 
of the slowdown, it is useful to divide growth into two components:  (1) growth in the 
cumulative number of hours of worked by all workers and (2) growth in the amount of 
output derived, on average, from each hour of work.  We re fer to output per hour of work 
as “labor productivity.”  From 1991 through 2007, w hen the economy expanded at a 
3 percent average rate, hours worked increased about 1 percent a year and economy -wide 
productivity grew about 2 percent (figure  5).3  Since 2007, both of these growth factors 
have slowed by about half, with hours worked annually increasing only 0.5 percent from 
2008 to 2018 and productivity rising just 1 percent on average.4   
Growth in hours worked has slowed, in part, because of slower U.S. population 
growth.  Birth rates have edged down, and immigration has slowed.  Not only is the total 
population growing more slowly, but the share of the population in their prime working 
years is falling steadily as the very large baby -boom generation is movi ng into retirement.  
Demographic factors are generally slow moving and predictable, and there is no surprise 
in the fact that slower population growth and the retirement of the baby boomers are now 
contributing to slower growth in the total amount of work performed in the economy.   
There is another factor contributing to the slower growth in hours, however, and 
this factor is more surprising and more troubling.  To be counted as “in the labor force,” a

the Budget and Economic Outlook:  2019 to 2029  (Washington:  CBO, January ),

Recovery of Output after 2009 ,” NBER Working Paper  No. 23543  (Washington:  National Bureau of 
Economic Research, June), https://www.nber.org/papers/w23543 .  - 5 - 
person must either be employed or have looked for work within the past four weeks.  The 
share of people of working age who are actually in the labor force has fallen significantly 
since the late 1990s.  This decline raises the important question  of w hy have people of 
working age increasingly chosen not to wor k.   
The data suggest that there are both positive and more problematic forces at work.  
For example, among those aged 16 to 24, participation in the labor market has fallen from 
about 65 percent in the 1990s to 55 percent now (figure 6).  But this drop in participation 
appears to reflect young people getting more education.  The fraction of this age group 
who are neither in school nor in the labor force has he ld fairly constant at around 
11 percent, and measures of school enrollment are up.5  Higher educat ional attainment is 
much more important in today’s job market than in the past, and investing in education 
today has long- term benefits for both the student and for society.6  Statistics confirm that 
higher educational attainment is associated with higher labor force participation, lower 
unemployment, and higher wages.   
Turning to those aged 25 to 54, the participation picture is  more troubling.  
Among prime -age men, participation has been falling for more than 60 years, with the 
decline averaging about 1.5 percentage points per decade (figure 7).  For women, 
participation rose over the second half of the 20th century until peaking in the late 1990s.  
Since then, women’s participation has dropped just a bit.   
                                                 
5 It is also true that a smaller share of students are holding down a job while in school.  
6 For example, see Maria E. Canon, Marianna Kudlyak, and Yang Liu (2015),  “Youth Labor Force 
Participation Continues to Fall, but It Might Be for a Good Reason, ” Federal Reserve Bank  of St. Louis, 
Regional Economist  (St. Louis, Mo.:  FRB St. Louis , January ), 
https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/regional -economist/january -2015/youth- labor -force .  - 6 - 
To put these numbers in context, let’s look at data from other advanced 
economies.   Prime -age male participation has fallen some across most of these economies 
since 1995 (figure  8).  But the decline in the United States has been much larger than 
most, and U.S. participation was below the middle of the pack at the outset.  As a result, 
the United States now has the fourth lowest participation rate among 34 advanced 
economies .  For women’s participation, the details are different, but the bottom line is 
similar.  In the mid -1990s, the United States ranked in the upper tier for prime -age 
women’s participation, but since then participation by women has advanced rapidly in 
many countries while it has declined slightly in the United States.  Now the United Stat es 
is sixth  lowest among these  34 countries.  
Researchers have investigated numerous possible reasons for the decline in prime -
age participation.  Among men, the drop in partici pation is much sharper for those with 
only a high school education or less.  The drop for women is also sharper for those who 
are high school educated.  This pattern is consistent with the idea that a modern economy 
demands ever -higher skills, and that wor kers without those skills are being left behind 
(figure 9).  But the international experience suggests that this outcome is not inevitable:  
The drop in participation among those with less education is much smaller in some 
comparable countries than in the United States.7   
The research into labor force participation in the United States and across the 
world does not find a magic fix, but it does suggest a variety of policies that might better 
prepare people for the modern workforce as well as support and reward labor force

Aren’t U.S. Workers Working?” Federal Reserve  Bank of San Francisco, FRBSF Economic Letter 2018 -24

participation.8  I should note that the Fed has neither the tools nor the mandate to directly 
address the forces that are holding back labor force participation.  We can contribut e by 
fostering a strong labor market , in accordance with our mandate .  While it is not the Fed’s 
role to advocate particular labor force policies, I do want to put a spotlight on this 
important issue.  I strongly believe policies that bring prime -age workers into productive 
employment, particularly those who may have been left behind because of low skills or 
educational attainment, could bring great benefits both to those workers and to our 
economy.   
The second factor accounting for the slowdown in GDP growth is the slower pace 
of labor productivity growth, or output per hour worked.  When measured annually, labor 
productivity growth is volatile, but focusing on five -year averages, we can see that from 
1975 through 2007, productivity growth average d about 2 percent while fluctuating 
between about 1 and 4 percent ( figure 10).  Since then, growth seems to have settled at 
the low end of that historical range.  Unlike the situation with labor force participation, 
the slowdown in productivity growth is also evident in most advanced economies, and the 
U.S. experience is roughly comparable to that of other countries.   
There is an ongoing debate over the causes and implications of this global 
slowdown in productivity growth.  Some argue that the rapid growth seen over much of 
the 20th century was historically anomalous, and that we are destined to return to the 
slower growth of centuries past.  Others are more optimistic that strong growth can 
return.

Many have noted that during the current expansion, investment and capital 
accumulation have been lower than in previous expa nsions, so perhaps we just need to 
invest more.  Unfortunately, it does not seem to be that simple.  Standard reasoning holds 
that capital -per-worker drives productivity.  While we have had slower capital 
accumulation of late, we have also had slower growt h in labor supply-- hours worked.  
Thus, capital per worker, according to some analysis, has continued to increase roughly at 
its pre -recession trend.  In this view, the productivity problem is not simply one of 
inadequate investment.9   
Researchers have pr oposed several reasons why, even if the quantity of 
investment has kept up, recent investment may be leading to smaller productivity 
advances than in the past.  The more optimistic analysts argue that we may be in a 
productivity lull while businesses work to realize the full benefit of advances that are 
embedded in recent investment.10  Others suggest that productivity -advancing ideas are 
inherently harder to find and exploit than in the past, implying that slower productivity 
growth may be with us for the l ong haul.11  This debate is unlikely to be resolved anytime 
soon.  In the meantime, we should look for policies that will create an environment in 
which productivity can flourish.

10 For example, Brynjolfsson, Mitchell, and Rock (2018) highlight the need to make complimentary 
investments in intangibles to take advantage of artificial intelligence  and other emerging technologies  (see 
Erik Brynjolfsson, Tom Mitchell, and Daniel Rock (2018), “ What Can Machines Learn  and What Does It 
Mean f or Occupations and the Economy?”  AEA Papers and Proceedings , vol.  108 (May), pp.  43-47).  And 
Mokyr (2014) argues that the vast array of computers and other relatively new tools will usher in a new 
wave of progress just like the invention of barometers and microscopes and other tools propelled the 
technology in the 1700s  (see Joel Mokyr (2014), “The Next Age of Inventi on,” City Journal,  Winter ). 
11 Bloom and others (2017) as well as Thompson and Spanuth (2018) discuss how it has become more 
costly to make tec hnological  advances .  See Nicholas Bloom , Charles I.  Jones , John Van Reenen, and 
Michael Webb  (2017), “Are Ideas Getting Harder to Find?” available at 
https://web.stanford.edu/~chadj/papers.html ; and Neil Thompson and Svenja Spanuth (2018), “The Decline 
of Computers As a General Purpose Technology:  Why Deep Learning and the End of Moore’s Law Are 
Fragmenting Computing, ” available at https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3287769 .  - 9 - 
We need policies that support innovation and create a  favorable environme nt for 
investment in both the skills of workers and the tools they have .  Indeed, the recent tax 
reforms were designed in part to boost capital investment and thus productivity.  Once 
again, my goal tonight is to highlight the importance of growth- enhancing policies.  
Because these policies are not the province of the Fed, I will not advocate for particular 
approaches.  Instead, I will just observe that researchers and policy analysts have 
proposed many promising ideas that may be capable of attracting wide s upport.  Policies 
that succeed in enhancing productivity growth would greatly benefit future generations of 
Americans.   
Conclusion 
To conclude, the United States is currently in the midst of one of the longest 
economic expansions in our history.  Unemploy ment is low and inflation is close to our 
2 percent  objective.  My colleagues and I on the FOMC are focused on using our 
monetary policy tools t o sustain those favorable conditions.   
Tonight I have also highlighted some longer -term challenges we face, including 
low labor force participation by prime -age workers and low productivity growth.  By 
promoting macroeconomic stability, the Fed helps create a healthy environment for 
growth.  But these longer -term issues require policies that are more in the provinc e of 
elected representatives.  The nation would benefit greatly from a search for policies with 
broad appeal that could promote labor force participation and higher productivity, with 
benefits shared broadly across the nation.   Recent Economic Developments and Longer- Term Challenges

International Symposium of the Banque de France

I would like to thank t he Banque de France for inviting me to take part in what I 
expect will be a l ively discussion. 
The suddenness  and severity of the global financial cr isis forced policymakers to 
respond rapidly and creatively , employing  a wide range of macro economic tools --
including both monetary and fiscal  polic ies--to arrest a steep economic downturn and 
restart the global economy.  G iven the slow and unsteady nature of the recovery, 
supportive policy remains necessary . 
Today I  woul d like to  briefly review the evolution of monetary and fiscal policies 
following the global financial crisis both in the United States and in other advanced 
economies, since we have faced similar experiences and employed similar policy 
responses.  I will try  to dra w some lessons and provide some thoughts on the policy mix 
going forward.  
Policy before the Crisis  
 Prior to the global financial crisis, inflation rates in the United States and other 
advanced economies were near their target levels and most of these economies appeared to be operating close to their potential.  Policy interest rates were similarly in the vicinity of levels considered to be normal.   
Fiscal deficits also appeared to be under control before the crisis .  According to 
the O rgani sation for E conomic C o-operation and Development  (OECD), general 
government deficits in 2007 were less than 4 percent of GDP in the U nited S tates and the 
United K ingdom , about 2 percent in Japan, and less than 1 percent, on average, in the 
euro area.  Still,  given relatively buoyant economic conditions, governments probably 
should have been doing more to prepare for the long -term challenge of aging  populations , - 2 - 
 
which will boost pension obligations and health- care expenditures  in coming years .  
Moreover, government d ebt levels were already high in Japan and in some European 
economies and not particularly low elsewhere.  In addition, some euro -area countries that 
appeared to have strong fiscal positions  going into the crisis  depended part ly on revenue 
from housing booms that soon went bust.   
The Policy Response to the Crisis  
 When the crisis hit, its global scope and severity w ere exceptional.  Central banks 
in the United States and other countries responded by rapidly and sharply reducing their 
policy interest rates, lowering them in many cases  to near zero .  In addition, in their role 
as lender s of last resort, central banks acted rapidly to pr ovide liquidity  to help stabilize 
the financial system and support  the flow of credit to households and businesses , in some 
cases creating new lending facilities .  These extraordinary and creative response s showed 
that monetary policymakers had internalized the lessons of the Great Depression.  
Initially, f iscal policy also provided significant stimulus .  A portion of this  
stimulus reflected the operation of automatic stabilizers --higher unemployment benefits, 
for example, and a decline in tax pay ments  due to lower income s--and some came 
through cuts in tax rates and increases in discretionary spending .  Expansive fiscal policy 
served to raise deficits in most countries , some of which faced further costs from 
stabilizing financial institutions , pushing  deficits even higher.   Sharp increases in deficits 
led in turn to escalating levels of government debt.    
Policy during the Recovery  
 The combination of i ncreasing debt and depressed output  led to rising ratios  of 
debt to gross domestic product (GDP) in many advanced economies and  heightened 
concern about whether the growth in debt  could be s ustained without unsettling financial 
 
 - 3 - 
 
markets.   As a result , early in the recovery governments began to withdraw fiscal 
stimulus , and, in most cases, fiscal policy became a net drag on econom ic growth.  This 
outcome was most evident in the euro -area periphery , where skyrocketing bond yields  
and deepening concerns about default left governments with little choice about whether 
to rein in stimulus .  In Spain, for example, the OECD estimates that fiscal consolidation 
has subtracted an average of 1- 1/2 percentage poi nts from GDP growth each year  since 
2009.  But fiscal policy also turned contractionary in countries facing less market pressure, such as the United Kingdom and the United States.  Governments in both countries embarked on fiscal consolidation programs over the past four years, sharpl y 
reducing their structural deficits , and , as a consequen ce, creating headwind s that slow ed 
the recovery.  
 With fiscal drag weighing on growth and with private -sector deleveraging also 
holding back consumption and investment, monetary policy bore the brunt of supporting 
the economy .  With policy rates at or approaching zero, central banks of necessity turned 
to unconventional polic y tools  such as  large -scale asset purchases and enhanced forward 
guidance about the future path of policy rates.  Th ese unconventional tools  have, in my 
view, served to support a  recovery in domestic demand and, as a consequence, global 
econom ic growth . 
Even so, the recovery in most advanced nations has proceeded more slow ly than 
policymakers would have hoped.  This sluggishness has been due in part to the severity of the financial shock associated with the crisis and the persistent headwinds to recovery in its aftermath .  But t he lack of fiscal support for demand in recent years also helps  
 
 - 4 - 
 
account for the weakness of this  recover y compared with past recoveries .1  In the United 
States,  fiscal policy has been much  less supportive relative to previous recoveries.  For 
instance, at a comparable point in the recovery from the 2001 recession, employment at 
all levels of government had increased by about 800,000 workers; in contrast, in the 
current recovery, government employment has declined by about 650,000 jobs. 
Lessons 
 What lessons can we draw from this experience?  The first  is that governments 
need to address long- term challenges and significantly improve  their structural fiscal 
balances during good times so they have more fiscal space t o provide stimulus when 
times turn ba d.  When poor economic conditions drive policy inter est rates close to  the 
zero lower bound, fiscal stimulus may be more effective than usual in boosting aggregate 
demand because it will not have the usual effect of raising real interest rates , thereby 
crowding out private demand.2  
A second lesson is that,  while even if it is  appropriate for fiscal policy to play a 
larger role when policy rates are near zero, policymakers nevertheless  may face 
constraints  in implementing fiscal stimulus .  This means that central banks need to be 
prepared to employ all available tools , including unconventional policies, to support 
economic growth and to reach their inflation targets .

A third critical lesson pertains to the importance of having a sound and resilient 
financial sector  with strong  capitalization  and prudent risk management , supported by 
effective regulation and s upervision.  T he recent cris is has appropriately increased the 
focus on financial stability at central banks around the world.  A t the European Central 
Bank ( ECB ), the recent c omprehensive  assessm ent is an important step toward building 
confidence in euro- area banks .  I wish the ECB great success as it takes on its new 
responsibilities at the center of the single supervisory mechanism.  At the Federal 
Reserve, we have devoted substantially increased resources to monitoring financial stability and have refocused our regulatory and supervisory efforts to limit the buildup of systemic risk.   This macroprudential approach to promoting financial stability will be an 
important complement to our ot her tools for promoting a healthy economy.   
Looking Ahead  
In advanced economies, the current macroeconomic policy mix generally remains 
one of extraordinary monetary policy stimulus and somewhat contractionary fiscal policy.  Considering the headwinds that continue to weigh on growth, employment, and 
prices, this s ituation  is hardly ideal .  Policymakers face difficult choices as they seek to 
balance the need for long -term fiscal sustainability with the need to support their 
economies in the near term.   
Even so, I continue to anticipate that the headwinds associated with the financial 
crisis will wane.  As employment, economic activity, and inflation rates return to normal, 
monetary policy will eventually need to normalize too, although the speed and timing of this normalization will likely differ across countries based on differences in the pace of recovery in domestic conditions.  This normalization could lead to some heightened financial volatility.  But as I have noted on other occasions, for our part, the Federal 
 
 - 6 - 
 
Reserve will strive to clearly and transparently communicate its moneta ry policy strategy 
in order to minimize the likelihood of surprises that could disrupt financial markets, both 
at home and around the world.  More importantly, the normalization of monetary policy will be an important sign that economic conditions more generally are finally emerging from the shadow of the Great Recession.

The U.S. Economic Outlook 
   
Remarks by 
Ben S. Bernanke 
Chairman 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
at the 
Economic Club of Minnesota 2011-2012 Season Inaugural Luncheon 
Minneapolis, Minnesota 
  
September 8, 2011  
Good afternoon.  I am delighted to be in the Twin Cities and would like to thank 
the Economic Club of Minnesota for inviting me  to kick off its 2011-2012 speaker series.  
Today I will provide a brief overview of th e U.S. economic outlook and conclude with a 
few thoughts on monetary policy and on the longer-term prospects for our economy. 
The Outlook for U.S. Economic Growth 
In discussing the prospects for the ec onomy and for policy in the near term, it 
bears recalling briefly how we got here.  The financial crisis that gripped global markets 
in 2008 and 2009 was more severe than a ny since the Great Depression.  Economic 
policymakers around the world saw the mounting risks of a global financial meltdown in the fall of 2008 and understood the extraordinar ily dire economic consequences that such 
an event could have.  Governments and centr al banks consequently worked forcefully 
and in close coordination to avert the loom ing collapse.  The actions to stabilize the 
financial system were accompanied, both in th e United States and abroad, by substantial 
monetary and fiscal stimulus.  Despite these strong and concerted efforts, severe damage 
to the global economy could not be avoided.  The freezing of credit, the sharp drops in 
asset prices, dysfunction in financial markets, and the resulting blows to confidence sent 
global production and trade into fr ee fall in late 2008 and early 2009. 
It has been almost exactly three years since the beginning of the most intense 
phase of the financial crisis, in the late su mmer and fall of 2008, and a bit more than two 
years since the official beginning of the ec onomic recovery, in June 2009, as determined 
by the National Bureau of Economic Resear ch’s Business Cycle Dating Committee.  
Where do we stand?  There have been some positive developments over the past few years.  In the financial sphere, our banking sy stem and financial markets are significantly - 2 - 
 
stronger and more stable.  Cr edit availability ha s improved for many borrowers, though it 
remains tight in categories--such as small business lending--in which the balance sheets and income prospects of potential borrower s remain impaired.  Importantly, given the 
sources of the crisis, structur al reform is moving forward in  the financial sector, with 
ambitious domestic and international effort s under way to enhance financial regulation 
and supervision, especially for the largest and systemically most important financial 
institutions.   
Nevertheless, it is clear that the recove ry from the crisis has been much less 
robust than we had hoped.  From recent comprehensive revisions of government 
economic data, we have learned that the r ecession was even deep er and the recovery 
weaker than we had previously thought; indee d, aggregate output in th e United States still 
has not returned to the level that it had atta ined before the crisis.  Importantly, economic 
growth over the past two years ha s, for the most part, been at  rates insufficient to achieve 
sustained reductions in the unemployment rate , which has recently been fluctuating a bit 
above 9 percent. 
The pattern of sluggish economic growth was particularly evident in the first half 
of this year, with real gross domestic produc t (GDP) estimated to have increased at an 
annual rate of less than 1 percent, on average,  in the first and sec ond quarters.  Some of 
this weakness can be attributed to tempor ary factors, includi ng the strains put on 
consumer and business budgets by the run-ups ear lier this year in the prices of oil and 
other commodities and the effects of the disa ster in Japan on globa l supply chains and 
production.  Accordingly, with commodity  prices coming off their highs and 
manufacturers’ problems with supply chains well along toward resolution, growth in the - 3 - 
 
second half looks likely to pick up.  However, the incoming data suggest that other, more 
persistent factors also have been holding back the recovery.  Conseque ntly, as noted in its 
statement following the August meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) 
now expects a somewhat slower pace of rec overy over coming quarters than it did at the 
time of the June meeting, with greater downside risks to the economic outlook.  
One striking aspect of the recovery  is the unusual weakness in household 
spending.  After contracting very sharpl y during the recession, consumer spending 
expanded moderately through 2010, only to decel erate in the first half of 2011.  The 
temporary factors I mentioned earlier--the rise in commodity prices, which has hurt 
households’ purchasing power, and the di sruption in manufacturing following the 
Japanese disaster, which reduced auto av ailability and hence sales--are partial 
explanations for this deceleration.  But hous eholds are struggling with other important 
headwinds as well, including the persistently high level of unemployment, slow gains in 
wages for those who remain employed, falling ho use prices, and debt burdens that remain 
high for many, notwithstanding that  households, in the aggregat e, have been saving more 
and borrowing less.  Even taking into account  the many financial pressures they face, 
households seem exceptionally cautious.  Indeed , readings on consumer confidence have 
fallen substantially in recent months as pe ople have become more pessimistic about both 
economic conditions and their ow n financial prospects.   
Compared with the household sector, the business sector generally presents a 
more upbeat picture.  Manuf acturing production has risen ne arly 15 percent since its 
trough, driven importantly by growth in expor ts.  Indeed, the U.S. trade deficit has 
narrowed substantially relative to where it wa s before the crisis, reflecting in part the - 4 - 
 
improved competitiveness of U.S. goods and services.  Business investment in equipment 
and software has also continued to expand.  Corporate balance sh eets are healthy, and 
although corporate bond markets have tightened somewhat of late, co mpanies with access 
to the bond markets have generally had littl e difficulty obtaining credit on favorable 
terms.  But problems are evident in the busine ss sector as well:  Business investment in 
nonresidential structures, such as office bu ildings, factories, a nd shopping malls, has 
remained at a low level, held back by elev ated vacancy rates at existing properties and 
difficulties, in some cases, in obtaining construction loans.  Also, some business surveys, including those conducted by the Federal Rese rve System, point to weaker conditions 
recently, with businesses reporting slower  growth in production, new orders, and 
employment. 
Why has this recovery been so slow and erratic?  Historical ly, recessions have 
tended to sow the seeds of their own rec overies as reduced spending on investment, 
housing, and consumer durables generates pent-up demand.  As the business cycle 
bottoms out and confidence returns, this pe nt-up demand, often augmented by the effects 
of stimulative monetary and fiscal policie s, is met through increased production and 
hiring.  Increased production in  turn boosts business revenues and increased hiring raises 
household incomes--providing further impetus to business and household spending.  Improving income prospects and balance sh eets also make households and businesses 
more creditworthy, and financial institutions become more willing to lend.  Normally, 
these developments create a virtuous circ le of rising incomes and profits, more-
supportive financial and credit conditions, and lower uncertainty, allo wing the process of 
recovery to develop momentum. - 5 - 
 
These restorative forces are at work today, and they will continue to promote 
recovery over time.  Unfortuna tely, the recession, besides bei ng extraordinarily severe as 
well as global in scope, was also unusual in being associated with both a very deep slump 
in the housing market and a hist oric financial crisis.  These two features of the downturn, 
individually and in combination, have acted to slow the natural recovery process.   
Notably, the housing sector has been a signi ficant driver of recovery from most 
recessions in the United States since World War II, but this time --with an overhang of 
distressed and foreclosed properties, tight credit conditions for bu ilders and potential 
homebuyers, and ongoing concerns by both potential borrowers and lenders about 
continued house price declines --the rate of new home cons truction has remained at less 
than one-third of its pre-crisis peak.  Depre ssed construction also ha s hurt providers of a 
wide range of goods and services related to housing and homebuilding, such as the 
household appliance and home furnishing industr ies.  Moreover, even as tight credit for 
builders and potential homebuyers has been one of the factors restraining the housing 
recovery, the weak housing market has in turn  adversely affected financial markets and 
the flow of credit.  For example, the sharp declines in house prices  in some areas have 
left many homeowners “underwater” on their mo rtgages, creating fina ncial hardship for 
households and, through their effects on rates of mortgage delinquency and default, stress 
for financial institutions as well. 
As I noted, the financial crisis of 2008 a nd 2009 played a central role in sparking 
the global recession.  A great d eal has been and continues to be done to address the 
causes and effects of the crisis , including extensive financial reforms.  However, although 
banking and financial conditions in the United States have improved significantly since - 6 - 
 
the depths of the crisis, financial stress contin ues to be a significant drag on the recovery, 
both here and abroad.  This drag has become  particularly evident in recent months, as 
bouts of sharp volatility and risk aversion in  markets have reemerged in reaction to 
concerns about European sove reign debts and related strain s as well as developments 
associated with the U.S. fiscal situation, including last month’s downgrade of the U.S. 
long-term credit rating by one of the major ratings agencies and the recent controversy 
surrounding the raising of the U.S. federal debt  ceiling.  It is difficu lt to judge how much 
these events and the associated  financial volatility have a ffected economic activity thus 
far, but there seems little doubt that they have hurt household and business confidence, 
and that they pose ongoing risks to growth. 
While the weakness of the housing sector and continued financial volatility are 
two key reasons for the frustratingly slow p ace of the recovery, other factors also may 
restrain growth in coming quarters.  For exam ple, state and local governments continue to 
tighten their belts by cutting spending a nd reducing payrolls in the face of ongoing 
budgetary pressures, and federal fiscal stimulus  is being withdrawn.  There is ample room 
for debate about the appropriate size and ro le for the government in the longer term, but--
in the absence of adequate demand from the private sector--a substantial fiscal 
consolidation in the shorter term could add to the headwinds facing economic growth and 
hiring.  
The prospect of an increasi ng fiscal drag on the economy in  the face of an already 
sluggish recovery highlights one of the many di fficult tradeoffs currently faced by fiscal 
policymakers.  As I have emphasized on prev ious occasions, without  significant policy 
changes to address the increasing fiscal burdens that will be associated with the aging of - 7 - 
 
the population and the ongoing rise in health-c are costs, the finances of the federal 
government will spiral out of control in coming decades, risking severe economic and 
financial damage.  But, while prompt and de cisive action to put the federal government’s 
finances on a sustainable trajectory is urgent ly needed, fiscal policymakers should not, as 
a consequence, disregard the fragility of the economic recovery.  Fortunately, the two goals--achieving fiscal sustainabi lity, which is the result of  responsible policies set in 
place for the longer term, and avoiding creation of fiscal headwinds for the recovery--are 
not incompatible.  Acting now to put in place a credible plan for reducing future deficits 
over the long term, while being attentive to the implications of fiscal choices for the 
recovery in the near term, can  help serve both objectives. 
The Outlook for Inflation 
Let me turn now from the outlook for grow th to the outlook for inflation.  Prices 
of many commodities, notably oil, increased sh arply earlier this year.  Higher gasoline 
and food prices translated directly into incr eased inflation for consumers, and in some 
cases producers of other goods and services we re able to pass th rough their higher costs 
to their customers as well.  In addition, the global supply disruptions  associated with the 
disaster in Japan put upward pressure on mo tor vehicle prices.  As a result of these 
influences, inflation picked up significantly; over the first ha lf of this year, the price 
index for personal consumption expenditures ro se at an annual rate of about 3-1/2 
percent, compared with an average of le ss than 1-1/2 percent over the preceding two 
years. 
However, inflation is expected to mode rate in the coming quarters as these 
transitory influences wane.  In particular , the prices of oil and many other commodities - 8 - 
 
have either leveled off or have come down from their highs.  Meanwhile, the step-up in 
automobile production should reduce pressure on  car prices.  Importantly, we see little 
indication that the higher rate  of inflation experienced so far this year has become 
ingrained in the economy.  Longer-term infla tion expectations have remained stable 
according to the indicators we monitor, such  as the measure of households’ longer-term 
expectations from the Thompson Reuters/Univ ersity of Michigan survey, the 10-year 
inflation projections of professional forecas ters, and the five-year-forward measure of 
inflation compensation derived fr om yields of inflation-protect ed Treasury securities.  In 
addition to the stability of longer-term inflation expectati ons, the substantial amount of 
resource slack that exists in U.S. labor a nd product markets should continue to have a 
moderating influence on inflationary pressu res.  Notably, because of ongoing weakness 
in labor demand over the course of the rec overy, nominal wage increases have been 
roughly offset by productivity gain s, leaving the level of unit labor costs close to where it 
had stood at the onset of the recession.  Gi ven the large share of  labor costs in the 
production costs of most firms, subdued un it labor costs should  be an important 
restraining influence on inflation.  
Monetary Policy 
Although the FOMC expects a moderate r ecovery to continue and indeed to 
strengthen over time, the Committee has res ponded to recent devel opments--as I have 
already noted--by marking down its outlook fo r economic growth over coming quarters.  
The Committee also continues to anticipate th at inflation will modera te over time, to a 
rate at or below the 2 percent or a bit less th at most FOMC participants consider to be - 9 - 
 
consistent with the Committee’s dual manda te to promote maximum employment and 
price stability. 
Given this outlook, the Committee decided at  its August meeting to provide more 
specific forward guidance about its  expectations for the future path of the federal funds 
rate.  In particular, the statement follo wing the meeting indicated that economic 
conditions--including low rates of resource ut ilization and a subdued outlook for inflation 
over the medium run--are likely to warrant ex ceptionally low levels for the federal funds 
rate at least through mid-2013.  That is, in what the Committee judges to be the most 
likely scenarios for resource utilization and inflation in the medium term, the target for the federal funds rate would be held at its cu rrent low level for at least two more years. 
In addition to refining our forward guidan ce, the Federal Reserve has a range of 
tools that could be used to provide additional monetary stimulus.  We discussed the relative merits and costs of such tools at our August meeting.  My  FOMC colleagues and 
I will continue to consider those and ot her pertinent issues, including, of course, 
economic and financial developments, at our meeting in September and are prepared to 
employ these tools as appropria te to promote a stronger econ omic recovery in a context 
of price stability. 
Conclusion 
 Let me conclude with just a few wo rds on the longer-term prospects for our 
economy.  As monetary and fiscal policymak ers consider the appropriate policies to 
address the economy’s current weaknesses, it  is important to ac knowledge its enduring 
strengths.  Notwithstanding the trauma of the crisis and the recession, the U.S. economy 
remains the largest in the world, with a highl y diverse mix of indus tries and a degree of - 10 - 
 
international competitiveness that, if anyt hing, has improved in recent years.  Our 
economy retains its traditional advantages of a strong market orientation, a robust 
entrepreneurial culture, and flexible capital and labor markets.  And our country remains 
a technological leader, with many of the world's leading research universities and the 
highest spending on research and development of any nation.  Thus I do not expect the 
long-run growth potential of the U.S. economy to be materially affected by the financial 
crisis and the rece ssion if--and I stress if--our country takes the necessary steps to secure 
that outcome.  Economic policymakers face a range of difficult decisions, and every 
household and business must cope with the st resses and uncertaintie s that our current 
situation presents.  These are not easy ta sks.  I have no doubt, however, that those 
challenges can be met, and that the fundame ntal strengths of our economy will ultimately 
reassert themselves.  The Federal Reserve will  certainly do all that it can to help restore 
high rates of growth and employment  in a context of price stability.

Conversation with the Chair:  A Teacher Town Hall Meeting  
 
Washington, D.C.  
 
(And via video link to Federal Reserve Banks)  
 
 
     
January 12, 2017 
  
Thank you, a nd thank you to all the educators who have come to the Board this 
evening or travelled to one of the Fed’s regional Reserve Banks to watch and listen via 
the webcast.     
I am very much looking forward to hearing from you about teaching economics , 
and I  am eager to respond to your questions.  For that reason, and also because I expect  
that school starts very early tomorrow for many of you, I will try to keep my remarks 
brief.  But I do have a message to impart about the work you do, which is vitally important not only to your students, but also, I believe, to the world they will soon inherit and even to the mission of the Federal Reserve.  
First and foremost, of course, li ke all teachers, you are helping prepare  your 
students for successful and rewarding lives.  The knowledge you impart and the intellect and talents you help develop are powerful tools your students can use to build those lives.  
Like some other subjects stu dents encounter in school, economics teaches analytical and 
critical thinking skills that can aid in the development and success of anyone.  Part of success for your students is economic success --as capable, creative, and productive  
members of the workforc e and as consumers adept at managing their finances.  
Economics provides knowledge and skills of practical use in college and in the workplace, and it also provides skills to plan and make wise financial decisions, which are some of the most important and consequential that we face in life.  
Your students benefit very directly from this education, but so does everyone else 
in soc iety.  Everyone is engaged in and depends on the economy, and nothing is more 
critical to a healthy and growing economy than the capability, creativity, and productiveness of its workforce.  Whenever I am asked what policies and initiatives could  - 2 - 
do the most to spur economic growth and raise living standards, improving education is 
at the top of my list.   
In addition to the role you play in preparing students for jobs and careers, you also 
help prepare them to be responsible consumers.  The economy needs productive workers , 
and it also depends on consumers, whose individual spending decisions, as most of you surely have taught in class, collectively account for two- thirds of economic activity.  
Consumers skilled in managing their finances are better prepared to weather bad times, and stronger household finances overall  can help sustain growth, stabilize the economy , 
and mitigate an economic downturn.     
Stabilizing the economy and mitigating a downturn, of course, also happen to be 
among the Federal Reserve’s primary responsibilities.  When successful, monetary policy can be a powerful and effective tool to these ends, but its capabilities are dwarfed by larger factors such as the productivity of the workforce and the strength of household 
finances.  By educ ating students and directly supporting their contributions to the 
economy as producers and consumers, all teachers, especially teachers of economics, are effectively furthering our mission at the Fed, so let me offer my thanks for making that job a little easier.  
To help support your important work as teachers, the Federal Reserve Board and 
the 12 Reserve Banks conduct programs, organize events, and publish books and other material s to spread knowledge of the role of the Fed--and economics in general --and t o 
promote financial literacy.  Before I get to those events and programs, let me say a word about what is probably the most important pedagogical aid that the Fed produces --the 
182-page book called The Federal Reserve System :  Purposes and Functions.  The 10th  - 3 - 
edition of Purposes and Functions , published in October of last year, offers a detailed 
and comprehensive account of what, why, and how the Fed carries out its different 
responsibilities.  I think it is a wonderful resource for teaching about  the Fed , and copies 
are available via the Board’s website.1 
Each of the Fed’s Reserve Banks has  community outreach and educational  
initiatives in the areas of the country they serve, and the outreach to economics teachers 
is coordinated by the group chaired by Amy Hennessy, the Federal Reserve System 
Economic Education Group.   
At the Board, we have for some years operated a program called FedEd, which 
sends Fed employees into schools throughout the Washington , D.C., metropolitan area 
and sponsors events for students here at the Eccles Building.2  FedEd’s outreach to 
schools depends on the time and sacrifice of several dozen research assistants, who are typically recent college graduates who work for two or three years at the Board.  
Research assistants who volunteer for FedEd visit schools ; help teach about the Fed, 
economics, and finance ; and answer questions about work opportunities at the Board.  
The Federal Reserve is committed to promoting diversity in our ranks and in the 
economics profession, and FedEd has furthered these goals by making sure to include 
schools with significant numbers of minority students.    
This past school year, FedEd sent research assistants into nine different schools 
and FedEd volunteers  have visited 38 different schools since  2012.  FedEd wa s back in 
schools last fall, drawing from 48 research assistants who volunteered to participate.  
                                                 
1 Purposes and Functions  is available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/pf/pf.htm . 
2 More information about FedEd is available on the Board’s website at 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/educational -tools/fed -education.htm .  - 4 - 
FedEd also sponsors several speaker events a year that bring students into this Board 
Room.  Students recently heard a presentation from Scott Alvarez, who oversees the Board’s Legal D ivision, and, in February, Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer will speak to 
students at another event.  FedEd is overseen by two research assistants, Caroline Shinkle and Jamie Lenney, along with Karen  Pence, who is an economist at the Board.  All three 
are wit h us this evening and prepared to answer further questions about the program. 
Online resources for teachers can be found on the Board’s website at 
federalreserve.gov , and additional resources avail able throughout the System are at 
federalreserveeducation.org .  The  websites include  videos in which policymakers and the 
staff describe the Fed’s functions.  Also, the sites include historical materials and a wealth of information related to the financial crisis and the Fed’s response.      
Let me leave it there, and again thank teachers for participating in this town hall, 
and offer my thanks, on behalf of the Board  of Governors, for the valuable work you do 
every day.  I would be very happy to respond to your questions. ",2017-01-12,yellen

June 28, 2016 
  
Thank you  for this opportunity to speak here today.  The Chicago C ouncil  on 
Global Affairs has been a thought leader  for nearly a century, encouraging public 
discourse, education, and research on important global issues.   The Council’s global 
focus is particularly important  for understanding the challenges facing the U.S. economy 
today, as shown by last week’s referendum on the United Kingdom’s status in the 
European Union .  In my remarks , I will review recent econom ic developments  and the 
outlook for the econ omy.  I will also discuss  the economy’s longer -term productive 
potential.   As always, the view I express here today are my own.  
The D ual Mandate and  State of the Economy  
As you know, t he Fed eral Reserve, through the Federal Open Market Committee 
(FOMC),  is charged by the Congress with achieving  maximum employment and stable 
prices --the dual mandate .  For price stability, t he FOMC has adopted a goal of 2 percent 
for inflation , as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal 
consumption expenditures .  Many other central banks in developed economies have 
adopted inflation goals centered around 2  percent .   
The FOMC has not set a numerical  goal for maximum employment, because the 
long-run sustainable level of employment is determined mainly by non-monetary factors  
that are outside the Fed’s control, such as demographics , social change, and fiscal and 
regulatory policies.  Nonetheless, four times a year , FOMC participant s write down their 
estimates of t he longer -run sustainable level of the unemployment rate  (which many 
interpret as the “natural rate”) ; at the recent June FOMC meeting the median estimate of 
that rate was 4.8  percent.    - 2 - 
How should we evaluate  our current performance against the dual mandate?  I 
would say that  we have made substantial progress toward maximum employment, 
although there is still some room for improvement .  We have more work to do to assure 
that inflation moves  back up to our 2 percent  goal.   
Let’s start with the e mployment mandate.  After several years of strong job 
growth, employment is now over 5 million higher than  the pre -crisis peak in 2007.  The 
unemployment rate has fallen from 10 percent in 2009 to 4.7 percent in May, essentially 
at the level that many observers identify as the natural rate.  This rate is ve ry far from a 
bright line --it cannot be observed directly, and estimates of its level are subject to great 
uncertainty.1  So we look to a wide range of labor market indicators to assess the overall 
health of the labor market.  Many of those indicators suggest that the labor market is 
strong.  To mention a few of these, j ob openings are at an all -time high by some 
measures.   The “quits ” rate--the rate at which employees voluntarily leave their jobs --is 
about at pre -crisis levels. Surveys of individuals and businesses suggest that the ease of 
finding and filling jobs is similar to that experienced in the mid -2000s . 
Even though  we are near the natural rate of unemployment, there is  still room for 
improvement on several margins.  I mportant among these is the labor force participation 
rate.  If someone leaves the labor force  for any reason, even temporarily, that person is 
not cou nted as unemployed.  So the labor force participation rate is also a key 
determinant of the unemployment rate.  Labor force participation is influenced by many 
                                                   
1 Confidence intervals around statistical estimates of the natural rate are routinely estimated to be quite 
wide, reflecting both uncertainty about the correct model specification as well as uncertainty about the 
parameter estimates given the model.  The ca nonical paper by Douglas Staiger, James H. Stock and Mark 
W. Watson (1997), “How Precise are Estimates of the Natural Rate of Unemployment ?,” in Christina D. 
Romer and David H. Romer, eds., Reducing Inflation: Motivation and Strategy  (Chicago: University of 
Chicago Press) puts the 95 percent confidence interval at 1½ percentage points on either side of the point estimate.   - 3 - 
factors, including the age structure of the population and individuals’ perceptions of the 
avail ability of jobs.  
Participation rose steadily from the 1970s through the 1990s as increasing 
numbers of women entered the formal workforce.  That process ran its course, and , 
around the year 2000,  participation began a gradual decline because of  population aging  
and the continuation of other long- term trends, particularly the decline in participation 
among prime age males .  From 2008 through 2013, participation dropped sharply by 3 
percentage points , but has remained about flat , on net , since late 2013 in a context of 
strong job growth and declining unemployment.  Economists estimate that, as the 
population ages, participation will naturally tend to decline at a trend rate of about 0 .2 
percentage point per  year, so this  period of flat participation actually represents an 
improvement against  the post -crisis cyclical drop.  Today, participation is near  its longer -
run trend as estimated by a group of Fed economists whose work is widely cited on these 
issues.2  Some other estimates suggest that there is still a s hortfall in participation, and , of 
course,  estimates of the trend participation rate are surrounded by fairly wide bands of 
uncertainty.  I am inclined to believe that there are potential workers at the margins of the 
labor market who will return as the re covery continues, the labor market tightens further 
and wages increase.  The U.S. participation rate for workers in the 25 -54 age group is  
now below those of most other advanced economies , including  the U.K. , France and 
Germany , for example .

The number o f part -time workers who want full time work remains above pre -
crisis levels, which suggests that there may be some remaining slack there  as well .  In 
addition, we should expect to see strong er wage increases as the labor market tightens.  
There are welcome signs of a firming in wages, seen most clearly in the data on average 
hourly earnings, which are rising faster than the sum of inflation and productivity growth . 
After several years of improving labor market conditions, recent data have be en 
sending mixed signals on the level of momentum in the economy.  Business investment 
has weakened, even outside the energy sector.  G rowth in gross domestic product (GDP) 
is estimated to have slowed to a rate of only  1-1/4 percent on an annualized basis over the 
fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year.  Incoming data do point to a 
rebound .  For example, the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow model, which bases its projection on 
a range of incoming monthly data, estimates growth of 2. 6 percent in the second quarter.  
In contrast, the labor market data, especially the monthly increase in payroll jobs, after displaying considerable strength for several years right through the first quarter of 2016, 
weakened significantly in April and May.  While I wo uld not want to make too much of 
two monthly observations, the strength of the labor market has been a key feature of the 
recovery, allowing us to look through quarterly fluctuations in GDP growth.  So the 
possible loss of momentum in job growth is worriso me.        
Turning to the inflation part of the mandate, the Fed’s preferred measure of 
inflation has consistently run below our 2 percent  objective since the end of the financial 
crisis, with the exception of the “Arab Spring” period in 2011, when oil prices  
temporarily  spiked.  For the 12 months ending in April, total inflation was only 1 percent , 
while core inflation (excluding food and energy prices) was 1 -1/2 percent.  Core inflation  - 5 - 
has been held down by falling import prices, owing in large part t o the rise in the dollar, 
as well as the indirect effects of lower oil prices.  If the dollar and oil prices remain 
broadly stable going forward, inflation should move up over time to our 2 percent 
objective.   
When I was first exposed to macroeconomics  in college, more than four decades 
ago, the view was that inflation was strongly influenced by  the amount of slack  in the 
economy.  But the relationship between slack and inflation has weakened substantially 
over the years .  In addition , inflation depends  importantly  on the inflation expectations of 
workers and firms.  A widely shared view among economists today is that, unlike during 
the 1970s, expectations are no longer heavily influenced by fluctuations in  inflation, but 
are fairly constant, or  anchored .  For both these reasons, inflation has become  less 
responsive to cyclical changes  in the economy.  We measure inflation  expectations 
through surveys of forecasters and the general public, and also through market readings 
on inflation swaps and “breakevens ,” which represent inflation compensation as 
measured by the difference between the return offered by nominal Treasury securities and 
that o ffered by TIPS.  Since mid -2014, these market -based measures have declined 
significantly  to historically low levels .  Some of this decline probably represents lower 
risk of high inflation, or an elevated liquidity preference for mu ch more heavily traded 
nominal T reasury securities, rather than expectations of lower inflation.  S ome survey 
measures  of inflation expectat ions have also trended down.  Given the importance of 
expectations  for determining inflation , these developments deserve , and receive, careful 
attention.  While inflation expectations seem to me to remain  reasonably well anchored, it  - 6 - 
is essential that they remain so .  The only way to assure that anchoring is to achieve 
actual inflation of 2 percent , and I am strongly committed to that  objective .   
Looking Ahead  
My baseline expectation has been that our eco nomy is likely to continue on its 
path of growth at around 2 percent.  I have also expect ed the ongoing healing  in labor 
markets to continue , with healthy  wage  increase s and job creation .  As the economy 
tightens, I have expect ed that inflation will move up over time to the Committee’s 2 
percent objective.   
For some time, the principal risks to that outlook have been from abroad .  Global 
economic and financial conditions are particularly important for the U.S. economy at the 
moment.   Weakness  in economic activity  around the world and related bouts of financial 
volatility  have weighed on the performance of our  economy.   Given the stronger 
performance of the U.S. economy, the trade -weighted value of the dollar has risen 
roughly 20 percent since 2014.  Such a large appreciation of the dollar means that we will 
“export” some of our strength to our trading partners and “import” some of their 
weakness.   
Growth and inflation remain stubbornly low for most of our major trading 
partners .  European and Japanese autho rities have limited scope to respond , with daunting 
longer -run fiscal challenges and policy rates already set below zero .  In China, stimulus 
measures should support growth in the near term, but may also slow China’s necessary transition away  from its export - and investment -led business model.  Emerging market 
nations such as Brazil, Russia and Venezuela face challenging conditions.   
These global risks have now shifted even further to the downside, with l ast 
week’s referendum on the United Ki ngdom’s status in the European Union .  The Brexit 
vote has the potential to create new headwinds for economies around the world, including  - 7 - 
our own.  The risks to the global outlook were somewhat elevated even prior to the 
referendum, and  the vote has intro duced new uncertainties.  We have said that the Federal 
Reserve is carefully monitoring developments in global financial markets, in cooperation 
with other central banks .  We are  prepared to provide dollar liquidity through our existing 
swap lines with central banks, as necessary, to address pressures in global funding 
markets, which could have adverse implications for our economy.  Although financial 
conditions have tightened since the vote, m arkets have be en functioning in an orderly 
manner.  And the U.S.  financial sector is strong and resilient.  As our recent stress tests 
show , our largest financial institutions continue to build their capital and strengthen their 
balance sheets.    
It is far too early to judge the effects of the Brexit v ote.  As the global outlook 
evolves, it will be important to assess the implications for the U.S. economy , and for the 
stance of policy appropriate to foster continued progress toward our objectives of 
maximum employment an d price stability.  
I am oft en asked why rates remain so low now that we are near full employment.  
A big part of the answer is that , at least for the time being,  the appropriate level of rates is 
simply lower than it was before the crisis.  As a result, p olicy is not as stimulative as it 
might appear to be.  Estimates of the real interest rate needed to keep  the economy on an 
even keel if it were operating at 2  percent  inflation and full employment --the “neutral 
rate” of interest --are currently around zero.  Today, the real short term interest rate is 
about negative 1 -1/4 percent , so policy is actually only moderately stimulative.   I 
anticipate that the neutral rate will move up over time, as some of the headwinds that 
have weighed on economic growth ease.   - 8 - 
Longer -term Considerations: Potential output, productivity , labor market fluidity, 
and business dynamism  
I would like to take a step back from the current context and explore an issue that 
ought to rece ive more attention --the longe r-run potential growth rate of our economy.  
One reason for the low neutral rate of interest is that potential growth appears to have 
slowed.  Since the crisis ended, forecasters have broadly reduced their estimates of longer 
run grow th by a full percentag e point --from about 3  percent to about 2 percent.3 This 
seem ingly modest reduction implies  dramatically smaller increases in  living standards 
over time.  A growing body of research shows that deep recessions accompanied by 
severe financial crises often leave behind permanent damage.4  One recent analysis 
suggests that in about one -third of such cases there is no permanent damage; one -third of 
the time there is a permanent reduction in the level of potential output but not its 
subsequent growth rate; and one third of the time there is a reduction in both the level of 
potential output and in the growth rate.5  Unfortunately, many economies are currently in 
danger of falling into the third category, including the U.S. economy.  
Output growth can be broken dow n into increases in hours worked and changes in 
output per hour, or productivity.  Most of the decline in estimated potential U.S. growth appears to be from lower productivity.  Labor productivity growth began to slow around 
2005-- before the crisis --and been only 1/2  percent  annually since 2011--the slowest five

Economic Indicators moved down from 2.9 percent in March 2007 to 2.1 percent in March 2016.

year period since World War II.  The productivity slowdown has been worldwide, and 
has been seen in countries that were not as strongly affected by the crisis, so U.S. specific 
factors are probably not the main cause.6   
Increasing productivity is necessary if living standards are to continue to rise over 
generations.  So two important questions arise:  Why has productivity growth been so 
slow?  And what does the  future  look like ? 
We have tentative answers to the first question.  Labor productivity is a function 
of three things.  The first two are the skills of the labor force, and the tools they have, 
particularly equipment, software and the like.  These are inputs to production and are 
driven by private and public investment .  The third determinant is called “total factor 
productivity, ” or TFP,  which refers to the ability of firms to produce more efficiently 
given the first two inputs.  For example, as businesses learned how to inc orporate 
advances in information technology into their production processes, there was a surge of 
productivity growth from roughly 1995 to 2005.   
The weak performance of productivity since the crisis appears to stem mainly 
from weak business investment an d low TFP  growth .  Weak business investment has 
result ed from weak demand and uncertainty about the pace of the recovery.  TFP is 
equally important and has generally account ed for most of the variation in productivity  
over time, but is less well understood  and so more difficult to forecast.   
The second question--what will happen wi th productivity going forward --is the 
subject of intense debate.  The range of forecasts  is wide, and the historical record

provides ample ground for humility.  This summer, m any will be carrying Robert 
Gordon’s massive The R ise and Fall of American Growth to the beach (or perhaps  to the 
lake, here in the Midwest) , which argues the pessimist ic view. 7  For balance, maybe 
bring along Brynjolfsson and McAfee’s The Second Machine Age , which take a more 
optimistic  view  and is a great deal shorter .8 
One factor that may contribute to  low productivity growth is the notable decline 
in recent decades in measures of the dynamism of our economy .  Entrepreneurs  start new 
firms; most of them  fail, but a few of them succeed, grow very rapidly,  and account for  
significant  amounts of job formation.   Older firms shrink or go out of business if they  fail 
to keep up with innovation and advances in productivity.  Workers change jobs and move 
around the country (or the world) as their careers evolve and as companies grow and 
shrink .  These processes can be  painful and messy for both workers and firms, but they 
are essential to the  allocat ion of  resources to their  highest, most productive uses.   The 
high levels of innovation and fluidity of  our economy have  long been thought to be 
among the  principal reason s for our high and rising living standards.   
The slowdown in essentially all of these processes is  seen in declining rates of 
creation and destruction of both firms and jobs.  
Start -ups:  Start -ups are a key driver of productivity growth.  Although it may feel 
that we are living in an age of disruption, the birthrate of startups has actually been in 
decline since the 1970s.9  New firms can be loosely grouped into two categories:  those

started by “lifestyle entrepreneurs” who want to be their own boss, but who have little 
prospect or desire for high growth; and those founded by transformational entrepreneurs 
who start businesses that aspire to grow dramatically and change their industry.  Before 2000, the decline in new firm entry was mainly in the first sort; since 2000, it is also 
found among the so-called transformational firm s.  While the drop in the formation of 
lifestyle -type firms could be neutral or even  a positive for productivity, as in the case of 
the U.S. retail sector, the reduction in the creation of high -performance new firms 
suggests that lower dynamism could be as sociated with slower productivity growth .

Labor Market Dynamism:  While c hanging jobs can be painful,  job changes in the 
aggregate are  associated with higher compensation, implying higher productivity.  But 
the rewards to job change may have declined.  Fe wer start -ups has meant lower “job 
flows ,” as measured by job creation and destruction, and fewer opportunities for workers 
to find better jobs .  And l abor market dynamism across many dimensions has declined by 
more than can be explained by the reduction i n startups.  W orkers have become less 
likely to leave their jobs, change jobs, o r move geographically to take new job s.11

 Dynamism is a relatively new field of inquiry, and there is no consensus yet on 
the reasons  for, or implications of,  these developments.  Some plausible sources of these 
changes are benign, while  others are more negative  and suggest that the reduction  in 
dynamism may be a  factor be hind the slower increases in productivity .  For example, 
historically there has been a robu st correlation at the firm level between productivity and 
growth, with high productivity levels being correlated with faster growth and low 
productivity levels being associated with contraction or exit.  This relationship has 
weakened since 2000, particula rly in the high -tech sector.12  High productivity firms are  
not grow ing as quickly,  and low productivity firms are shrink ing or exiting at a slower 
pace.   
 It may be that some government policies, while well intended, have contributed to 
these trends.  On e example  that may explain a small portion of the reduction in dynamism 
is the substantial increa se in occupational licensing .13  By some estimates, the fraction of 
workers who are required to hold a government issued license or certification to perform 
their jobs has risen from 5 percent in the 1950s to close to 40 percent.14  Like many 
policies, licensing has benefits and costs.  Among the costs are that it  tends to reduce job 
switching and employment opportunities for excluded workers , and may restrict 
compe tition and thus increase prices faced by consumers .  Among the benefits may be 
higher  quality  product s and services and improved health and safety standards .  Some 
researchers have advanced the view  that licensing requirements ha ve become overly

 Dynamism is a fast -developing field of research, and it will be important that 
public policy react appropriately as this work continues .  It goes without saying that 
economic policymakers should use all available information and tools to create a 
supportive environment for growth .  We need policies that support labor force 
participation and the development of skills, business hiring and inve stment, and 
productivity growth.  For the most part, these policies  are outside the remit of the Federal 
Reserve , but m onetary policy can contribute by support ing a strong and durable  
expansion , in a context of price stability .  
Conclusion 
How should we th ink about the performance of our economy since the Crisis?  
The picture is mixed, and that question will no doubt be debated in the decades ahead.  
But here are some facts.  Since 2011, j ob growth has been stronger and unemployment 
has declined faster than most forecast s.  On the other hand, economic growth has been 
consistently lower than almost all private - and public -sector forecasts, including those of 
FOMC participants.  Growth has been slower in this recovery than in many previous 
recoveries; a growin g body of research shows that weak  recoveries are the norm after 
deep recessions and those associated with severe financial crises.  Finally, our recovery 
has also been stronger than those of many  other advanced econom ies following  this 
crisis.

I expect our economy to continue to make progress.  Monetary policy will need to 
remain supportive of growth,  as we work through the challenging global environment .

assess the stance of policy appropriate to foster continued progress toward our objectives 
of maximum employment and price stability.

The Effects of the Great Recession on  Central Bank Doctrine and Practice 
 
  
Remarks by 
 
Ben S. Bernanke 
 
Chairman 
 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
 
at the 
 
56th Economic Conference 
 
Federal Reserve Bank of Boston 
 
Boston, Massachusetts 
 
      
October 18, 2011  
 
The financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, togeth er with the associated deep recession, 
was a historic event--historic in the sense that its severity and economic consequences 
were enormous, but also in the sense that, as the papers at this conference document, the 
crisis seems certain to have profound a nd long-lasting effects on our economy, our 
society, and our politics.  Mo re subtle, but of possibly gr eat importance in the long run, 
will be the effects of the crisis on intellect ual frameworks, including the ways in which 
economists analyze macroeconomic and financial phenomena. 
In particular, the crisis has already infl uenced the theory and practice of modern 
central banking and no doubt will continue to do so.  Although it is too early to know the 
full implications of recent events for centr al bank doctrine and operations, I thought it 
would be worthwhile today to highlight and put  into context some of the changes, as well 
as the continuities, that are already evident.   My remarks will fo cus on how central banks 
responded to recent challenges related to th e conduct of both monetary policy and the 
promotion of financial stability and how, as a result of that experience, the analysis and 
execution of these two key functions may change. 
The Monetary Policy Framework 
 During the two decades preceding the crisis, central bankers and academics 
achieved a substantial degree of  consensus on the intellectual and institutional framework 
for monetary policy.  This consensus polic y framework was characterized by a strong 
commitment to medium-term price stability and a high degree of transparency about central banks’ policy objectives and economic forecasts.  The adoption of this approach 
helped central banks anchor longer-term infl ation expectations, whic h in turn increased 
the effective scope of monetary  policy to stabilize output and employment in the short - 2 - 
 
 
 run.  This broad framework is often called fl exible inflation targeting, as it combines 
commitment to a medium-run inflation object ive with the flexibility to respond to 
economic shocks as needed to moderate deviat ions of output from its  potential, or “full 
employment,” level.  The combination of s hort-run policy flexibility with the discipline 
imposed by the medium-term inflation target ha s also been characterized as a framework 
of “constrained discretion.”  Many central banks in both advanced and emerging market economies consider themselves to be inflation targeters, prom inent examples including those in Australia, 
Brazil, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, No rway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.  
Although they differ somewhat in the details of  their policy strategies, policy tools, and 
communication practices, today vi rtually all inflation-targeting central banks interpret 
their mandate flexibly--that is, they treat th e stabilization of empl oyment and output in 
the short term as an important policy objective even as they seek to hit their inflation 
targets over the medium term.  Several other major central banks, such as the European 
Central Bank (ECB) and the Swiss National Ba nk, do not label themselves as inflation 
targeters; however, they have  incorporated key features of  that framework, including a 
numerical definition of pri ce stability, a central role for communications about the 
economic outlook, and a willingness to acco mmodate short-run economic stabilization 
objectives so long as these objectives do not  jeopardize the primary goal of price 
stability.  How does the Federal Reserve fit into this range of policy frameworks?  The 
Federal Reserve is accountable to th e Congress for two objectives--maximum 
employment and price stability, on an equal footing--and it does not have a formal, - 3 - 
 
 
 numerical inflation target.  But, as a practical matter, the Federal Reserve’s policy 
framework has many of the elements of flexible  inflation targeting.  In particular, like 
flexible inflation targeters, the Federal Op en Market Committee (FOMC) is committed to 
stabilizing inflation over the medium run while  retaining the flexibility to help offset 
cyclical fluctuations in economic activity and employment.   
Also, like the formal inflation target ers, over time the Federal Reserve has 
become much more transparent about its outlook, objectives, and policy strategy.  For 
example, since early 2009, the Federal Rese rve’s “Summary of Economic Projections” 
has included the FOMC’s longer-run pr ojections, which represent Committee 
participants’ assessments of the rates to  which economic growth, unemployment, and 
inflation will converge over time.  These projections are conditioned on the assumptions of appropriate monetary policy and no furthe r shocks to the economy; consequently, the 
longer-run projections for inflat ion in particular can be inte rpreted as indicating the rate 
of inflation that FOMC participants judge to be most consistent, over time, with the 
Federal Reserve’s mandate to foster maximu m employment and stable prices.  These 
longer-run inflation projections are thus an alogous to targets a lthough, importantly, they 
represent the Committee participants’ individua l assessments of the mandate-consistent 
inflation rate, not a formal inflati on goal of the Committee as a whole.
1   
 To what extent, if at all, has the pr e-crisis consensus framework for monetary 
policy been changed by recent events?  In part  because they recognized the benefits of 
continuity and familiarity during a period of  upheaval, central banks generally retained 
their established approaches to monetary pol icy during the crisis; and, in many respects, 
                                                             
1 In a similar vein, since 2006 the Bank of Japan has provided the range of individual policy board 
members’ understanding of the inflation rate consistent  with price stability.  That understanding is reviewed 
annually. - 4 - 
 
 
 the existing frameworks proved effective.  Notably, well-anchored longer-term inflation 
expectations moderated both in flation and deflation risks, as price-setters and market 
participants remained confident in the ability of  central banks to keep inflation near target 
in the medium term.  The medium-term focus of  flexible inflation targeting also offered 
central banks latitude to cu shion the effects of the fi nancial shocks on output and 
employment in the face of transi tory swings in inflation.  In particular, they were able to 
avoid significant policy tight ening in mid-2008 and early 2011 , when sharp increases in 
commodity prices temporarily drove headline in flation rates above target levels.  Finally, 
for central banks with polic y rates near the zero lowe r bound, influencing the public’s 
expectations about future policy actions became a critical tool, as I will discuss further 
shortly.  The commitment to a policy framewor k that is transparen t about objectives and 
forecasts was helpful, in many instances, in  managing those expectations and thus in 
making monetary policy both more predictabl e and more effective during the past few 
years than it might otherwise have been. 
 However, the recent experience did raise at least one important question about the 
flexible inflation-targeting framework--namel y, that although that framework had helped 
produce a long period of macroeconomic stabil ity, it ultimately, by itself, was not enough 
to ensure financial stability.  Some observers have argued that this failure should lead to 
modifications, or even a replacement, of the inflation targeting approach.  For example, 
since financial excesses tend to develop over a relatively longer time frame and can have 
significant effects on inflation when they ulti mately unwind, it has been suggested that - 5 - 
 
 
 monetary policy should be conducted with reference to a longer horizon to take 
appropriate account of financial stability concerns.2   
 My guess is that the current framewor k for monetary policy--with innovations, no 
doubt, to further improve the ability of central banks to  communicate with the public--
will remain the standard approach, as its bene fits in terms of macr oeconomic stabilization 
have been demonstrated.  However, central banks are also heeding the broader lesson, 
that the maintenance of financial stability is  an equally critical responsibility.  Central 
banks certainly did not ignore issues of financia l stability in the decades before the recent 
crisis, but financial stability policy was often viewed as the junior partner to monetary policy.  One of the most important legacies of the crisis will be the restoration of 
financial stability policy to co-equal  status with monetary policy.  
Monetary Policy Tools 
 While central banks may have left th eir monetary policy frameworks largely 
unchanged through the Great Recession, they ha ve considerably widened their set of 
tools for implementing those frameworks.  Fo llowing the crisis a nd the downturn in the 
global economy that started in  2008, central banks responded w ith a forceful application 
of their usual policy tools, most prominently shar p reductions in short-te rm interest rates.  
Then, as policy rates approached the zero lo wer bound, central banks began to employ an 
increasingly wide range of less conventional tools, includ ing forward policy guidance and 
operations to alter the scale and co mposition of their balance sheets. 
                                                             
2 For example, Charles Bean of the Bank of England has suggested that “taking on board the possible risks 
posed by cumulating financial imbalances may require a shift in the rhetoric of inflation targeters towards 
the longer term.”  See page 70 of Charles Bean (2003), “Asset Prices, Financial Imbalances and Monetary 
Policy:  Are Inflation Targets Enough?” in Asset Prices and Monetary Policy , proceedings of a conference 
sponsored by the Reserve Bank of Australia (New South Wales, Australia:  RBA, Aug. 18-19), pp. 48-76, 
available at  www.rba.gov.au/publications/confs/2003.  - 6 - 
 
 
  Forward guidance about the future path of  policy rates, already used before the 
crisis, took on greater importance as policy ra tes neared zero.  A prominent example was 
the Bank of Canada’s commitment in April 2009  to keep its policy rate unchanged at 
1/4 percent until the end of the second quarter of 2010, depending on the outlook for 
inflation.3  This commitment was successful in cl arifying for market participants the 
bank’s views on the likely path of policy rate s and appears to have helped reduce longer-
term interest rates, thus providing additio nal policy accommodation.  In 2010, the Bank 
of Japan, which faced ongoing deflation in consumer prices, also used conditional 
forward guidance, saying that “The Bank will maintain the virtually zero interest rate 
policy until it judges, on the basis of the ‘ understanding of medium- to long-term price 
stability,’ that price stability is in sight, on condition that no problem will be identified in 
examining risk factors, including the accumulation of financial imbalances.”4 
 Some central banks provide forward guida nce directly by releasing forecasts or 
projections of their policy rate.  This pract ice had already been adopted by the Reserve 
Bank of New Zealand (in 1997), the Norges  Bank (in 2005), and the Swedish Riksbank 
(in 2007).  Each of these central banks used t hose projections during th e financial crisis to 
indicate that they were likely to keep rates at low levels for at least a year. 
 In the United States, the FOMC intr oduced language in its March 2009 statement 
indicating that it anticipated ra tes to remain at low levels fo r an “extended period,” and at 
its August 2011 meeting the Committee elaborat ed by indicating that it anticipated rates

per cent and, conditional on the inflation outlook, commits to hold current policy rate until the end of the

 would remain low at least through mid-2013.5  The FOMC continues to explore ways to 
further increase transparency about  its forecasts and policy plans. 
 In addition to forward guidance about shor t-term rates, a number of central banks 
have also used changes in the size and com position of their balance sheets as tools of 
monetary policy.  In particular, the Fede ral Reserve has both greatly increased its 
holdings of longer-term Treasury securities and broadened its portfolio to include agency 
debt and agency mortgage-backed securities.   Its goal in doing so was to provide 
additional monetary accommodation by putti ng downward pressure on longer-term 
Treasury and agency yields while inducing i nvestors to shift their portfolios toward 
alternative assets such  as corporate bonds and equities.  These actions also served to 
improve the functioning of some stressed fi nancial markets, especially in 2008 and 2009, 
through the provision of market liquidity.   
Other central banks have also used their balance sheets more actively than before 
the crisis, with some differences in their motivations and emphasis, in part reflecting 
differing financial structures across countries.  For exampl e, the Bank of England has 
used large-scale purchases of medium- and long-term government securities as its 
preferred tool for providing additional stimulus ; it expanded the size of its asset purchase 
program earlier this month out of concern abou t possible slowing of domestic and global 
economic growth.  The Bank of Japan has acq uired a wide range of  assets, including 
government and corporate bonds, commercial pa per, exchange-traded equity funds, and 
equity issued by real estate investment corporations.  The ECB purchased privately

 issued covered bonds between July 2009 and June 2010 to improve liquidity in a key 
market segment; it recently announced plans to  resume such purchases in November.  
The ECB has also bought the sovereign bonds of some vulnerable euro-area countries, 
“to ensure depth and liquidity in those market segments which are dysfunctional,” 
although the monetary effects of these purchas es have been sterilized through offsetting 
operations.6 
In most cases, the use of balance sheet policies for macroeconomic stabilization 
purposes has reflected the constraints on more-conventional polic ies as short-term 
nominal interest rates reach ve ry low levels.  In more normal times, when short-term 
policy rates are not constrained, I expect that balance sheet po licies will be rarely used.  
By contrast, forward guidance and other fo rms of communication about policy can be 
valuable even when the zero lower bound is not relevant, and I exp ect to see increasing 
use of such tools in the future. 
Financial Stability Policy 
 Even as central banks were innovative in the operation of thei r monetary policies, 
they were forced to be equally innovative in restoring and maintaini ng financial stability.  
Serving as a lender of last re sort--standing ready in a crisis to lend to solvent but illiquid 
financial institutions that have adequate collate ral--is, of course, a traditional function of 
central banks.  Indeed, the need for an in stitution that could serve this function was a 
primary motivation for the creation of th e Federal Reserve in 1913.  The Federal 
Reserve’s discount window is an example of a facility that operates  in normal times to 
provide very short-term liquidity to depository institutions.  Most other central banks 
                                                             
6 See European Central Bank (2010), “ECB Decides on Measures to Address Severe Tensions in Financial 
Markets,” press release, May 10, www.ecb.int/press/pr/date/2010/html/pr100510.en.html. - 9 - 
 
 
 have facilities with similar features that are generally aimed at banks that find themselves 
with temporary liquidity needs.  During the cr isis, as short-term funding markets failed to 
function normally, central banks around the world acted forcefully to channel liquidity to 
institutions and markets by lengthening the term s of their lending, in creasing the range of 
collateral accepted, and expanding the set of counterparties with which they would 
undertake operations.  To help stabilize the financial system and facilitate the flow of credit to households and businesses, the Federal Reserv e responded to the dislocations in funding 
and securitization markets by dramatically in creasing the amount of term funding that it 
provided to banks, establishing new lendi ng facilities for nonbanks, and providing 
funding to support the operation of key market s.  Elsewhere, including Canada, the euro 
area, and the United Kingdom, central banks  introduced similar facilities or expanded 
existing facilities to boost the pr ovision of liquidity in their lo cal currencies.  The types of 
facilities have varied across countries commensurate with differences in financial 
systems.  In the euro area, where the banki ng sector plays a relati vely large role in 
financial intermediation, the ECB focused on increasing liquidity to banks.  Similarly, the Bank of England sought to improve banks’ liquidity positions by allowing them to 
exchange illiquid mortgage-backed securities fo r U.K. treasury bills for up to three years.  
 One of the lessons of the crisis was that financial markets have become so 
globalized that it may no longer be sufficient for central banks to offer liquidity in their 
own currency; financial institutions may face liquidity shortages in other currencies as 
well.  For that reason, the Fede ral Reserve established bilatera l currency swap agreements 
with 14 foreign central banks during the fina ncial crisis.  The swap facilities have - 10 - 
 
 
 allowed these central banks to borrow dollars from the Federal Reserve to lend to banks 
in their jurisdictions, which has served to ease conditions in dollar funding markets 
globally.  Similarly, the ECB established bilate ral swap lines with several other central 
banks in Europe to exchange euro s for their respective currencies. 
 As lender of last resort, a central bank  works to contain episodes of financial 
instability; but recent events have shown the importance of anticipating and defusing 
threats to financial stability before they can inflict damage on th e financial system and the 
economy.  In particular, the crisis illustrated some important benefits  of involving central 
banks in financial supervision.  Among these benefits are the fac ilitation of close and 
effective information sharing between s upervisors and the providers of backstop 
liquidity, especially during crises; the abil ity to exploit the substantial overlap of 
expertise in the making of monetary polic y and financial stability policy; and the 
usefulness of the information supervisors ga ther about economic and financial conditions 
for monetary policy.  Appreciation of these bene fits is leading to larger roles for central 
banks in financial supervision.  For exam ple, the Bank of England received expanded 
powers and responsibilities for financial stability with the establishment of a prudential 
regulator as a subsidiary of the bank and th e creation of a separate Financial Policy 
Committee within the bank that will identify, monitor, and take action to reduce systemic 
risks.  In the euro area, the newly create d European Systemic Risk Board, which is 
chaired by the president of the ECB and incl udes the governors of all European Union 
central banks, draws heavily on central bank expertise, including an alytical, statistical, 
and administrative support from the ECB.  In  the United States, the Federal Reserve has 
reoriented its existing supervisory activities to incorporate a broade r systemic focus; it - 11 - 
 
 
 also has been assigned new responsibilities fo r financial stability, including supervisory 
authority over nonbank financial institutions that are designate d as systemically important 
by the Financial Stability Oversight Council a nd new backup authorities for systemically 
critical financial market utilities. 
The Integration of Monetary Policy  and Financial Stability Policies 
 As I noted earlier, in the decades prior to the crisis, monetary policy had come to 
be viewed as the principal function of central  banks; their role in  preserving financial 
stability was not ignored, but it was downplayed to some extent.  The financial crisis has 
changed all that.  Policies to enhance financia l stability and monetary  policy are now seen 
as co-equal responsibilities of central banks.  How should these two critical functions fit 
together? 
At an institutional le vel, as I have already suggest ed, the two functions are highly 
complementary.  Monetary policy, financia l supervision, and le nder-of-last-resort 
policies all benefit from the sharing of in formation and expertise.  At the Federal 
Reserve, for example, macroeconomists help  design stress-test scenarios used by bank 
supervisors, while supervisors provide information about credit conditions to macroeconomic forecasters.  Threats to financ ial stability, and their potential implications 
for the economy, are thoroughly discu ssed at meetings of the FOMC. 
An important debate for the future concer ns the extent to which it is useful for 
central banks to try to make a clear distin ction between their m onetary and financial 
stability responsibilities, including designa ting a separate set of  policy tools for each 
objective.  For example, throughout the crisis  the ECB has maintained its “separation 
principle” under which it orients changes in it s policy interest rate toward achieving price - 12 - 
 
 
 stability and focuses its unconventional liqui dity and balance sheet measures toward 
addressing dysfunctional markets.  The idea that  policy is more effective when separate 
tools are dedicated to separate objectives is  consistent with the principle known to 
economists as the Tinbergen rule.7 
In practice, the distinct ion between macroeconomic and financial stability 
objectives will always be blurred to some exte nt, given the powerful interactions between 
financial and economic conditions.  For exampl e, monetary policy actions that improve 
the economic outlook also tend to improve the conditions of financial firms; likewise, 
actions to support the normal functioning of financial institu tions and markets can help 
achieve the central bank’s monetary polic y objectives by improving credit flows and 
enhancing monetary policy transmission.  Still,  the debate about whet her it is possible to 
dedicate specific policy tools to the macroeconomic and financ ial stability objectives is a 
useful one that raises some important prac tical questions.  A leading example is the 
question of whether monetary policy should “lea n against” movements in asset prices or 
credit aggregates in an effort  to promote financial stability.  In my view, the issue is not 
whether central bankers should ignore possibl e financial imbalances--they should not--
but, rather, what “the right tool for the job” is to respond to such imbalances.8   
 The evolving consensus, which is by no m eans settled, is that monetary policy is 
too blunt a tool to be routin ely used to address possible financial imbalances; instead, 
monetary policy should remain focused on macroeconomic objectives, while more-
                                                             
7 The Tinbergen rule states that if  the number of policy targets surpasses the number of instruments, then 
some targets may not be met.  See Jan Tinbergen (1952), On the Theory of Economic Policy  (Amsterdam:  
North-Holland).  
8 See Ben S. Bernanke (2002), “Asset-Price ‘Bubbles’ and Monetary Policy,” speech delivered at the New 
York Chapter of the National Association for Business Economics, New York, N.Y., October 15,

 targeted microprudential and macroprudential to ols should be used to address developing 
risks to financial stability, such as excessi ve credit growth.  Prudential tools can be 
structural or cyclical in natu re.  Examples of structural pr udential tools ar e measures to 
ensure adequate levels of capital and liquid ity in the banking sector  or to increase the 
resiliency of the financial infrastructure.  Ex amples of cyclical pr udential tools include 
varying caps on loan-to-value ratios on mort gages, as Korea and Hong Kong have done; 
dynamic provisioning for losses by banks, as em ployed in Spain; time-varying margin 
and haircut rules; and countercyclical capital  requirements, as have been set out in 
Basel III.  In principle, structural and cyclical prudential tools could both damp the 
buildup of imbalances and bolster the resilience of the financial sector to a decline in 
asset prices by increasing its capacity to ab sorb losses.  The dive rse tools of financial 
regulation and supervision, toge ther with appropriate monito ring of the financial system, 
should be, I believe, the first line of defense against the threat of financial instability.  
However, the effectiveness of such targeted policies in practice is not yet proven, so the 
possibility that monetary policy could be used directly to support financial stability goals, 
at least on the margin, should not be ruled out. 
Conclusion 
 The financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 w ill leave a lasting imprint on the theory 
and practice of central banking.  With respect to monetary po licy, the basic principles of 
flexible inflation targeting--the commitment  to a medium-term inflation objective, the 
flexibility to address deviations fr om full employment, and an emphasis on 
communication and transparency--seem destined to survive.  However, following a much 
older tradition of central ba nking, the crisis has forcefu lly reminded us that the - 14 - 
 
 
 responsibility of central banks to  protect financial stability is at least as important as the 
responsibility to use moneta ry policy effectively in th e pursuit of macroeconomic 
objectives.   
An evolving consensus holds that central banks can dedicate separate toolkits to 
achieving their financial stability and macro economic objectives, but this consensus must 
be viewed as provisional.  Ce rtainly, those toolkits appear  to be much better stocked 
today than before the crisis:  monetary po licy tools that can be  brought to bear if 
necessary include the manageme nt of the central bank’s bala nce sheet and, to a greater 
extent than in the past, communication about fu ture policies.  Financial stability policy 
encompasses, as the first line of defense at least, a range of  microprudential and 
macroprudential tools, both structural and varying over the cycle,  supported by enhanced 
monitoring and analysis of pot ential risks to systemic stab ility.  Clearly, understanding 
and applying the lessons of the crisis will take some time yet; both theorists and 
practitioners of central banking have  their work cut out for them.   ",2011-10-18,bernanke

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System

“The Future of Macroeconomic Policy ,” a conference sponsored by

I have been asked to talk about monetary policy and financial stability in today’s 
economic environment.1  The r ecent stress in  the U.S. banking system has brought these 
two topics, their interlinkages,  and the tools we use to achieve our goals  to the forefront 
of central bank policy and public discourse .  In short, although financial stability and 
monetary policy  tools are used independently, they are nevertheless inter connected via 
their respective effe cts on the macroeconomy.  So le t me take a few minutes to discuss 
this topic in more detail.    
Financial  stability is essential for monetary policy in the U nited S tates to achieve 
its congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability.  
Importantly , stable financial markets and institutions allow changes in the stance of 
policy to transmit in a smooth and expected way to the financial conditions  that 
households and businesses face in making spending and production decisions.  I nstability 
in the fina ncial system , on the other hand, hinders economic activities of households and 
businesses, which impedes the attainment of our dual mandate.  This is in large part why 
the Federal Reserve monitors financial stability risks —to help ensure that banks, nonbank 
financial institutions, and financial markets can continue channeling credit to households 
and businesses.  
But this is a two -way street.  Financial stability depends on a healthy economy, 
and all else equal is strengthened by monetary policy actions take n to promote our 
macroeconomic goals.  The U.S. financial system is generally resilient enough to handle large shocks.  However, in March, we saw an instance where this wasn’t true.  A rapid, sizable increase in interest rates resulting from persistently e levated inflation contributed

Market Committee.   - 2 - 
to stresses in the banking system that we needed to address using our financial stability 
tools.  
Despite the interconnections  between maximum employment, price stability, and 
financial stability , the tools we use to promote f inancial stability are separate and distinct 
from the tools we use to carry out monetary policy .  And , I will argue , that separation is 
appropriate , as each set of tools is fit to its respective purpose.  
The set of tools the Federal Reserve uses to address financial stability issues is 
targeted and surgical.  These  include bank supervisory and regulatory tools that are used 
on an ongoing basis to promote the safety and soundness of individual financial firms and 
build a resilient financial system.  T here a re also tools  that provide liquidity to banks and 
other financial intermediaries in emergencies, such as the discount window or lending 
facilities created to extend credit more broadly .   
So far, these financial stability tools have had a  good track record of effectively 
promoting financial stability  in the U nited S tates.  Numerous lending facilities set up in 
the spring of 2020 helped limit strains that the pandemic put on the financial system.  More recently , when the failure of Silicon Valley Bank led to the loss of deposits at ot her 
banks, the discount window and a new facility to help en sure banks have the ability to 
meet the needs of all their depositors  have been effective at containing stresses in the 
banking system.  Importantly, these actions  to address financial stability enabled us to 
continue to pursue  our monetary policy objectives during these times.  
Compared with financial stability tools that address liquidity or other strains in 
targeted individual institutions or segments of the finan cial system, monetary policy 
affects everyone and every part of the econom y and would be a blunt and less effective  - 3 - 
tool to address financial stability problems.  That said, in carrying out monetary policy , 
we do consider  how credit conditions and other factors related to  financial stability are 
affecting the economy.  As I argued in a speech last month , the recent strains in the 
banking sector  may lead to a tightening of price and nonprice conditions for lending.2  If 
that is the case, then it might reduc e the need for at least some further tightening of 
monetary policy to lower inflation .  The Fed could tighten policy too much if it ignored 
such a development.  
To make this argument more concrete, consider the onset of the pandemic in 
March 2020.  The Federal O pen M arket C ommittee  held t wo unscheduled meetings 
where , recogniz ing that the coronavirus would weigh on economic activity and pose risks 
to the economic outlook, it lowered the policy target range down to zero.  At the same 
time, the unprecedented uncertainty about how the macroeconomy would be affected by 
the pandemic destabilized  financial markets, which led the Federal Reserve to put in 
place several lending facilities to support  the system .  We took each of these actions 
independently; w e did not lower the policy rate for the sole purpose of achieving 
financial stability.  Although both types of tools  were used simultaneously, they were 
used to solve di fferent problems.  
Financial stresses in the banking sector are a factor that my colleagues and I are 
closely watching as we determine the appropriate stance of monetary policy  going 
forward .  While lending conditions imposed by banks have tightened since M arch, the 
changes so far are in line with what banks have been doing since the Fed began raising

interest rates more than a year ago .  That is, it is still not clear that recent strains in the 
banking sector materially intensified the tightening of lending conditions. 
Let me end by noting that some have argued that the Fed’s tightening of monetary 
policy was significantly responsible for the failures and stress in the banking system.  
They argue we should have taken this into account when setting policy.  Let me state 
unequivocally:  The Fed ’s job is to use monetary policy to achieve its dual mandate, and 
right now that means raising rates to fight inflation.  It is the job of bank leaders to deal 
with interest  rate risk , and nearly all  bank leaders have done exactly that .  I do not 
support altering the stance of monetary policy over worries of ineffectual management at a few banks.  We will continue to pursue our monetary policy goals, which ultimately 
support a healthy financial system .  At the same time, we  will continue to use our 
financial stability tools  to prevent the buildup of risks in the financial system and, when 
needed, to address strains that may emerge.  ",2023-06-16,waller

The Economic Outlook and the Conduct of Monetary Policy  
   
Remarks by

January 1 9, 2017  It is a privilege to be here today to discuss how the Federal Reserve is conducting 
monetary policy to promote a healthy economy.  For more than 30 years, research from 
the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research has i nform ed economic policy , and 
events such as  this one have help ed foster debate among scholars, policymakers, business  
leaders , and members of the public  on critical economic issues facing our nation .  I 
appreciate the opportunity to participate .   
In my remarks today , I will review the considerable progress the economy has 
made toward  the attainment of the two objectives that the Congress has assigned to the 
Federal Reserve-- maximum employment and price stability.   The upshot is t hat labor 
utilization is close to its estimated  longer -run normal level , and we are closing in on our 
2 percent inflation objective .  I will then discuss the prospects for adjusting monetary 
policy in the manner needed to sustain a strong job market while maintaining low and 
stable inflation.  Determining how best to adjust the federal funds rate over time to 
achieve these objectives will not be easy .  For that reason, in the balance of my remarks , I 
will discuss some considerations  that will help inform our decisions , including the 
guidance provided by  simple policy rules .  I will conclude by touching  on some key 
uncertainties affecting the outlook.   
Progress to Date 
My assessment of progress to date will begin with the labor market.  S ince the 
depths of the Great Recession, about 15- 1/2 million jobs have been added to the U.S. 
economy , on net .  In 2016, job gains averaged about 180,000 per month, well above the 
pace of 75,00 0 to 125,000 per month that is  probably  consistent with keeping the - 2 - 
 
unemployment rate  stable over the longer  run.1  The unemployment rate is now close to 
estimates of its longer -run normal level , and other m easures of labor utilizati on have 
improved appreciably.  As shown in f igure 1, a broad er measure of labor 
underutilization --the U -6 measure, which includes not only the unemployed but also 
people working part  time who would like full -time employment and those  who would 
like a job but are not actively looking --has retraced nearly all of the steep  run- up that 
occurred as a result of  the recession.2  
Other indicators also support the view that the labor market has largely recovered 
from the  severe downturn t hat occurred in the wake of the financial crisis.  As illustrated 
by the red dashed line in f igure 2, the quits rate --an indicator of workers’ confidence 
about leav ing an existing job to pursue new opportunities --is nearly back to its pre-
recession level.   And some indicators, such as small business es’ assessments of the 
difficulty of hiring , shown by  the solid black line , as well as the average length of time it 
takes firms to fill vacancies and the job o pening s rate, even suggest that the labor market 
is a bit  tighter  than be fore the financial crisis.  Of course,  both the labor force 
participation rate and the employment- to-population ratio are still much lower t han they 
were a decade ago.  But the cyclical element in these declines looks to have largely 
disappeared, and what is left seems to mostly reflect the aging of the population and other secular trends.
3  Based on this array of labor market indicators , I judge  labor utilization  to 
be reasonably close to its normal longer -run level  while also recognizing that  estimates of 
                                                           
1 The sustainable longer -run pace of payroll employment growth depends on a number of a factors, such as 
the growth rate of the working -age population, trend movements in labor force participation, and the 
prevalence of self -employment and multiple job hold ings, so it cannot be predicted with precision.  
2 The normal level of the U -6 measure may  now be somewhat higher than it was prior to the financial crisis 
because of a trend toward greater reliance on part -time workers  in many sectors.  See Golden (2016).  
3 See Aaronson and others (2014).  - 3 - 
 
the sustainable level s of the une mployment rate  and the employment -to-population ratio 
are inherently imprecise.4   
In the coming months, I expect some further strengthening in labor m arket 
conditi ons as the economy continues to expand at a mod erate pace-- a view that is shared 
by most of my colleagues  on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) .5  Overall 
economic growth has been  driven by consumer spending, which has been bolstered  by 
substantial gains in household income and wealth .  Business investment, in contrast, has 
been soft .  But recent readings on business sentiment and new orders for eq uipment are 
consistent with the view that capital spending will likely strengthen modestly this year ; 
another positive factor is that oil drilling , which plummeted after oil prices fell sharply 
back in late 2014, has recently begun to pick up.  As we l ook to broader trends, gross 
domestic product ( GDP ) growth has been restrained in recent years by a variety of forces  
depressing both supply and demand, including slow  labor force  and productivity growth, 
weak growth  abroad , and lingering headwinds from the financial crisis .  Although I am 
cautiously optimistic that some of these forces will abate over time, I anticipate that  they  
will continue to restrain overall growth  over the medium term , likely hold ing down the 
level of interest rates consistent with stable labor market conditions.   
Turning to inflation , we are now much closer to the FOMC’s  2 percent objective 
than we were just a ye ar ago.  P rices , as measured by the index for personal consumption 
expenditures (PCE) , rose  nearly  1-1/2 percent in the 12 months ending in November, as 
                                                           
4 In addition, a persistently strong labor market could potentially lead some firms to rely less on part -time 
workers , or might encourage some people to rejoin the labor force who would otherwise sit on the 
sidelines.   However, evidence on these sorts of endogenous supply -side effects is rather limited, as I noted 
in a recent speech (see Yellen, 2016).

meeting can be found a t www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20161214.htm . - 4 - 
 
compared with only 1/2 percent  during 2015.  Moreover, core PCE inflation --a better 
indicator  of the underlying inflation trend --picked up 1/4 percentage point , to a little over 
1-1/2 percent.  T his rise in inflation was anticipated and largely represent s a fading of the 
effects of  earlier  declines in energy prices and the prices of non- energy import s.  In 
addition, slack in labor and product markets  is no longer pla cing downward pressure on 
inflation , in contrast to the situation only a few years ago when the unemployment rate 
was still quite elevated.  Barring future major swings in oil prices and the foreign 
exchange value of the dollar , inflation is likely to move up t o 2 percent over the next 
couple of  years , aided by a strong labor market.   
In light of the progress  that has been achieved toward our  employment and 
inflation objectives  and the Committee’s assessment of the outlook, the FOMC raised the 
target range for the federal funds rate at its December meeting  by 25 basis points , to 
between 50 and 75 basis points.  The Committee judge s, however, that the stance of 
monetary policy remains  modestly accommodative , and so policy  should support some 
further strengthening  in labor market conditions  and thus t he return of inflation to our 2 
percent goal .  
Maintaining S ustainable G rowth in a C ontext of P rice S tability  
With the unemployment rate near its longer -run normal level and likely to move a 
bit lower  this year, a natural question is whether monetary policy has fallen behind the 
curve .  The short answer, I believe, is “no .”  It is true that many employers  report 
difficulties in  finding qualified w orkers  in selected occupations , and that more workers 
are comfortable quitting jobs to take or look for better positions .  But  this is to be - 5 - 
 
expect ed in a healthy labor market  and not evidence that the economy as a whole is 
experiencing a serious worker shortage .   
The recent behavior of wages provides a dditional e vidence pertaining to the 
degree of labor market slack .  As shown in f igure 3, increases in average hourly earnings, 
the e mployment cost index , and compensation per hour remain subdued, pick ing up only 
modestly of late .6  Again , these data do not seem consistent with an overheated labor 
market .  Moreover, signs of overheating in  the broader economy are also scarce.  For 
example, capacity utilization in the manufacturing sector is well below its historical 
average.  Most importantly, although core inflation is rising gradually from a low level, this increase mainly reflects the waning of the effects of earlier movements in the dolla r, 
not upward pressure from resource utilization . 
Of course, even if the labor market is not overheated  currently , one might  worry 
that overheating could rapidly emerge  as labor market conditions strengthen further , 
causing inflation to surge.  I consider th is unlikely for several reasons.  First, the pace of 
labor market improvement has slowed appreciably  in the past couple of years :  For 
example, average payroll gains moderated from 2 50,000 per month in 2014 to 180,000 
last year , and the unemployment rate  declined 1- 3/4 percentage points cumulatively over 
                                                           
6 An exception to this pattern is the Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth Tracker (WGT), which does show a 
noticea ble acceleration in hourly wages as self -reported in the Current Population Survey.  Like average 
hourly earnings, the WGT excludes benefits costs and so is less comprehensive than the ECI or business -
sector compensation per hour ( CPH ).  In addition, the WGT is based on a smaller sample than the measures 
shown in Figure 3 and it only covers a sub -set of the workforce-- specifically, employed individuals who 
were also employed a year ago, and whose earnings are less than $150,000 per year.  Finally, because 
average hourly earnings and business -sector CPH are measured as total wages divided by total hours, an 
increase in wages for high earners has a larger effect in those measures than a similarly proportioned increase for lower -wage workers, and this is not s o for the WGT.

2014 and 2015, compared with only 1/4 percentage  point last year.7  Second, economic 
growth more broadly seems unlikely to pick up markedly in the near term given the 
ongoing restraint from weak foreign d emand and other factors that I mentioned, 
particularly in an env ironment in which monetary policy  is likely to become gradually 
less accommodative.  Finally , figure 4 illustrates the relationship over the past several 
decades between labor market pressures  and core inflation.  Note that d uring  periods 
when the unemployment rate fell  below the C ongressional B udget O ffice’s estimate of its 
normal long -run level , shown by  the yellow shaded regions , core inflation , the solid red 
line, rose little , if at all.  This stability is especially marked since i nflation expectations 
became anchored during  the mid -to-late 1990s.8    
That said, I think t hat allowing the economy to run markedly and persistently 
“hot” would be risky and unwise.  W aiting too long to remove accommodation could 
cause inflation expectations to be gin ratchet ing up, driving actual inflation higher and 
making it harder to control .  The combination of persistently low interest rates and strong 
labor market conditions could lead to undesirable increases in leverage and other financial imbalances , although such risks would likely take time to emerge .
9  Finally, 
                                                           
7 Many other labor market indicators also improved more slowly in 2016 relative to the pace seen in the 
prior two years, including the U -6 measure of labor utilization, the rates of job openings, hiring and quits, 
survey readings on net hiri ng plans and the difficulty of filling vacancies, and the average duration of 
unemployment.  A notable exception to this general pattern is the labor force participation rate, which 
declined fairly steadily from 2007 through 2015 but then flattened out las t year despite continuing 
downward pressure from the aging of the population and other factors.  However, improvements in labor market conditions along this dimension arguably reflect an increase in potential output, and so they are probably not a source of inflationary pressures.  
8 During the late 1960s through the 1970s, however, inflation did rise noticeably whenever the 
unemployment rate moved below its longer -run normal level, primarily because the Federal Reserve did 
not adequately check persistent m ovements in inflation by tightening monetary policy, thereby allowing 
inflation expectations to drift.  This experience illustrates the importance of keeping inflation expectations anchored through systematic policy actions.  
9 The Federal Reserve closely m onitors a wide range of indicators of financial stability , which currently 
provide little evidence of significant increases in leverage or rapid growth in credit.  However, some asset - 7 - 
 
waiting too long to tighte n policy could require the FOMC to eventually raise interest 
rates rapidly, which could risk disrupt ing financial markets  and pushing the economy into 
recession.  For these reasons, I consider it prudent to adjust the stance of monetary policy 
gradually over time --a strategy that should improve the prospects that the economy will 
achieve sustainable growth with the labor market operating at full employment and 
inflation running at about 2 percent .    
Evaluating the A ppropriate S tance of M onetary P olicy  
Achieving these goals could prove challenging, however, even if the economy 
manages to avoid being hit with adverse shocks  over the next few years.  To sustain a 
strong job market with inflation at our 2 percent objective, policy must gradually shift 
toward  a neutral stance, where “neutral” is defined as a level of the federal funds rate that 
is neither expansionary nor contractionary when the economy is operating near its potential.  But  what level of the federal funds rate is neutral at the present time?  How 
quickly should the funds rate target move up to this neutral level?  And how will the 
neutral rate itself evolve over time ?     
To help answer such questions , the FOMC considers a voluminous amount of 
information  concerning  many factors,  including financial markets  and credit availability , 
labor market conditions and overall economic  activity , wages and prices, and foreign  
economic developments.  The FOMC  also evaluates  forecasts from a range of economic 
models, assessments of key risks to the outlook, and detailed analyses of h ow different 
monetary policy strategies would affect projected outcomes  and risks .  Among the 
                                                           
valuations, particularly for commercial real estate, are high.  With reg ard to the linkages between labor 
utilization and financial stability, my interpretation of the historical evidence  is that undesirable increases in 
leverage or the emergence of asset bubbles are not the inevitable consequence of tight labor markets  per se . - 8 - 
 
strategies routinely considered by the Committee are the recommendations of a variety of 
simple monetary policy rules.  In addition, FOMC participants prepare individual 
projections on a quarterly basis of the most likely paths of key macroeconomic variables under their own assessments of “appropriate monetary policy ,” together with their 
estimates of the normal longer -run values of th e federal funds rate, the unemployment 
rate, and GDP growth.
10  Armed with this wealth of information, the Committee as a 
whole then decides on the most appropriate policy action to adopt at each of its meetings .  
Such a comprehensive , forward -looking  approach to policymaking i s similar to that 
employed at other  central banks.11 
Figure 5 shows a plot of FOMC participants’ most recent assessments of the 
appropriate path for the federal funds rate through 2019.  The black solid lines  show the 
median value of the federal funds rate at the end of each year.  To understand the 
considerations that likely underlay these judgments, I will contrast participants’ 
assessments with the recommendations of some simple policy rules commonly used t o 
help gauge the appropriate stance of policy.  As I noted, the Committee routinely reviews 
policy recommendations from  a variety of benchmark rules , and I believe that the ir 
prescriptions can be helpful in providing broad guidance about how the federal funds rate should be adjusted over time in response to movements in real activity and inflation.  That said,  I will emphasize that  the use and interpretation of such prescriptions require 
                                                           
10 These individual projections are published quarterly in the Summary of Economic Projections  that 
accompanies the release of the minutes from the March, June, September and December meetings of the 
FOMC.  
11 The FOMC’s procedures share many of the features of forecast targeting , an approach to monetary 
policy making advocated by Svensson (2005) , among others.   However, while the Committee publishes 
participants’ projections --including policy paths --in the SEP, it does not publish a “consensus” forecast, in 
contrast to some other central banks.  - 9 - 
 
careful judgments about both the measurement of the inputs to these rules and the  
implications of the many considerations  the rules do not take into account.  
Consider  first the well -known Taylor rule , which embodies key principles of good 
monetary policy .  The rule  calls for systematic adjustments in  the federal funds rate 
relative to its expected longer -run neutral  level in response to movements in in flation and 
the output gap, defined as the percentage difference b etween actual output and the 
economy’s productive potential .12  To implement the rule, one must decide on the 
appropriate definition  and measurement of its  input s.  Should inflation be defined using 
the latest noisy quarterly reading  on headline PCE inflation or a measure intended to 
smooth through trans itory price movements ?  What technique should be used to 
approximate  the output gap, given that different approaches often yield materially 
different estimates?  And what assump tion should be made about the neutral value of the 
federal funds rate in the long er run?   
The Taylor rule is often  implemented by assuming that the real , or inflation -
adjusted , value of the long er-run neutral interest rate --which I will call R* for 
                                                           
12 Formally, the rule originally published by Taylor (1993) can be written as 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡=𝑅𝑅∗+𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡+
0.5(𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−𝜋𝜋∗)+0.5𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡, where R is the federal funds rate, R* is the level of the real federal funds rate that on 
average is expected to be consistent with sustaining maximum employment and stable inflation  in the 
longer run, π is current inflation, π* is the central bank’s inflation objective (2 percent, in the case of the  
Federal Reserve), and Y  is the output gap, defined as the difference between the current level of real GDP 
and what it would be if the economy was operating at maximum employment.   Importantly, the rule 
embodies t hree key principles that central banks tak e into account when setting policy to stabilize inflation 
and the overall economy.  First, a persistent movement in inflation requires a more than one- for-one 
response of the policy rate to stabilize inflation.  Second, monetary policy should raise real in terest rates 
above their normal longer -run level when ever inflation is above its desired level and resource utilization is 
higher than normal, and lower them when the opposite holds.  ( Note that implementing this latter principle 
requires estimates of both  the economy’s productive potential and the longer -run level of the real policy 
rate that would be consistent with keeping the economy operating on an even keel .)  And, finally, 
policymakers should respond in a systematic manner to changes in economic cond itions in order to help 
financial market participants and others better understand how policy is likely to respond over time to 
current and future events, thereby influencing expectations in a way that promotes economic stability.  - 10 - 
 
convenience --is equal to 2 percent , roughly  the average historical value of the real federal 
funds rate prior to the financial crisis .  For inflation, we can use the 12- month ch ange in 
core PCE prices , a measure of the current underlying  rate of inflation .  And the output 
gap can be reasonably approximated as  twice the difference between the estimated  
longer-run normal rate of unemployment and the actual unemployment rate.13  The 
dashed  red line  in figure 5 shows the result ing recommendations for policy over the 
medium term, based on the medians of the unemployment  and inflation projections 
submitted by FOMC participants  in December  but assuming --in contrast to the median of 
participants’ December assessments --that  R* equals 2 percent .  As f igure 5 shows , this 
version of the Taylor rule prescribes a much  higher path for  the federal funds rate than 
the median of participants’  assessments of appropriate policy . 
One important factor explaining this divergence is the FOMC’s growing 
recognition that the longer -run neutral  level of the real federal funds rate has likely 
declined  below 2 percent , contrary to what is often assumed in implementations of the 
Taylor rule.  As illustrated by the left- hand panel of f igure 6, since 2000, both FOMC 
participants and respondents to the Blue Chip survey  have mark edly reduced their 
projections of the level of real short -term interest rates expected to prevail in the longer 
run.  Presumably, these revisions were made in response to accumulating evidence that 
lower real interest rates than  those seen on average  in the past  would be needed 
permanently to keep the economy operating on an even keel .  In addition, the right -hand 
panel shows considerable changes over time in estimates of the normal longer -run rate of 
                                                           
13 Historically, percent d eviations of real GDP from statistical estimates of its long -run trend are roughly 
twice as large on average as deviations of the unemployment rate from its estimated long -run value --a 
relationship known as Okun’s l aw.    - 11 - 
 
unemployment, with corresponding implications for estimates of the economy’s 
productive potential  and the output gap.  Such revisions would imply shifts in the level of 
the Taylor rule’s prescriptions by a s much as 1 -1/4 percentage points , holding other 
factors constant.14  Clearly, s ensible implementation of policy rules requires adjustments 
to take such changes into account , as a failure to do so would result in poor monetary 
policy  decisions and poor economic outcomes.15 
Figure 7 illustrates the policy implications of alternative revised assessment s of 
the longer -run neutral real r ate of interest.  As before, the short -dashed red line shows  the 
prescriptions of the Taylor rule using the standard 2 percent assumption for R*.  The solid red line , however, shows the rule ’s prescri ptions  with R* equal to 1 percent, the 
median of the longer -run projections of the real federal funds rate made by FOMC 
participants la st month.  This adjustment appreciably reduces the rule’s policy 
prescriptions .  
Even with this downward adjustment  of the longer -run neutral rate , however, the 
Taylor rule ’s prescriptions  are arguably still too restrictive .  The problem is that the rule 
ignore s the likelihood that i t will likely take many years before the forces now restraining 
                                                           
14 Additional complications  arise in the measurement of economic slack because the difference between the 
unemployment rate and its estimated normal level is not always a complete gauge of overall labor 
utilization.  Such was the case in the current expansion until recently because the labor force participation 
rate was unusually low and involuntary part -time employment unusually high,  given the level of the 
unemployment rate.   Moreover, although movements in resource utilization for the economy as a whole are 
generally proportional to changes in labor utilization, the relationship varies somewhat over time. Partly as a result, contemporaneous estimates of the output gap can deviate markedly from subsequent estimates for the same period calculated using revised data.  For example, in early 2010, the Congressional Budget 
Office (CBO) estimated that the output gap in 2009:Q2 was negative 7.7 percent, but the CBO has since 
lowered it to negative 6.3 percent --a large revision with important implications for assessments of the 
deviation of actual policy from the prescriptions of simple policy rules.    
15 If monetary policy persistently followed the prescriptions of a Taylor rule that assumed that R* was 
2 percent when it was in fact 1 percent, then employment would run persistently below its  maximum 
sustainable level and inflation would run persistently below 2 percent.  Under such circumstances, inflation 
expectations might begin to fall, creating a risk of deflation.    - 12 - 
 
the economy dissipate to the degree envisioned in participants’ estimate s of the longer -
run normal  level of the real federal funds rate.  Because overall growth has been quite 
moderate over the past few years despite an  accommodative stance of monetary policy, 
some recent e stimates of the current  value of the neutral real federal funds rate stand 
close to zero.16  If the neutral rate were to remain quite low over the medium term, as 
would be expected if the global economy does not materially strengthen and productivity 
growth remain s anemic, then the appropriate setting for  R* in the Taylor rule would 
arguably be  zero , yielding a yet lower path for the federal funds rate , as shown by the  
long-dashed red line.  These consideratio ns illustrate that there is now no obvious “right” 
setting for R* because we do not know how rapidly the forces  restraining the economy 
will abate , and there is a significant risk that it could be very slow.  When the economy 
has been hit with unusually persistent shocks , the Taylor rule , for this reason,  provides a  
problematic benchmark .   
Simple policy rules also typically neglect information with potentially important 
implications for the economic outlook because they  focus only on where conditions are 
today.  For example,  simple rules ignore  such important fa ctors  as fiscal policy, tren ds 
affecting global growth, structural  developments influencing  the supply of credit , and 
overall financial conditions .  One special factor at the moment pertains to the Federal 
Reserve’s balance sheet.  The downward pressure on long er-term interest rates that the 
Fed’s asset holding s exert is  expected to diminish over time --a development that amounts 
                                                           
16 For example, see Holston, Laubach , and Williams (2016).   - 13 - 
 
to a “passive” removal of monetary policy accommodation.  Other things being equal, 
this factor argues for a more gradual approach to raising short -term rates.17   
Lastly, simple rules ignore  important r isk-management considerations  that have 
influenced the Committee’s decisions in recent years .  With the federal funds rate still 
near zero, the Committee recognizes that, s hould the economy unexpectedly weaken  in 
the next year or two, there would likely be only limited scope to respond by lowering 
short -term rates.  But if the economy  instead began  to overheat, threaten ing to push 
inflation to an undesirably high level, the FOMC would have ample scope to re spond 
through tighter monetary policy.  Such asymmetric risks  arguably call for a more  gradual 
path of rate increases than indicated by  the prescriptions of a simple policy rule. 
The academic literature on policy rules has studied  many alternatives to the 
Taylor rule, and the FOMC regularly reviews a number of them.18  These rules embed 
differing but valuable perspectives, and there is no consensus among central bankers or 
academics about the relative utility of various rules.  One such  alternative is the 
“balanced  approach” rule , illustrated by the purple  short -dashed  line in figure 8 .  This 
rule differs from the Taylor rule by being twice as responsive to movements in resource 
                                                           
17 Based on estimates generated using the term -structure model developed by Li and Wei (2013) and the 
procedure discussed in Ihrig and others (2012) and extended by Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider (2015), 
the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage -backed securities continue to 
put considerable downward pressure on longer -term interest rates .  However, this pressure is estimated to 
be gradually easing as the average maturity of the portfolio declines and the end -date for reinvestment 
draws closer.  Over the course of 2017, this easing could increase the yield on the 10- year Treasury note by 
about 15 basis points, all else being equal.  Based on the estimated co -movement of short -term and long -
term interest rates , such a change in longer -term yields would be similar to that which, on average, has 
historically accompanied two 25 basis point hikes in the federal funds rate.   
18 For example, prescriptions from seven different rules, calculated using forecasts of economic activity and 
inflation from different sources, are regularly posted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland at https://www.clevelandfed.org/our -research/indicators -and-data/simple -monetary -policy -rules.aspx

utilization .19  The prescriptions of the balanced- approach rule  in this figure , as with the 
solid red Taylor -rule plot , assume that R* equals 1 p ercent, consistent with the median s 
of the latest FOMC projections .  Because participants  on average a nticipate a modest 
undershooting of the unemployment rate below its estimated longer -run level, the 
balanced -approach rule calls for a slightly faster  pace of tightening over the next several 
years than the Taylor rule .   
Figure 8 also reports results for a “change” rule, shown as the green long -dashed 
line.  As its name implies , this rule does not prescribe a particular level of the federal 
funds rate at a given time  but rather how the existing rate  should change from quarter to 
quarter based on two gap s--the difference between inflation and its desired level  as well 
as the difference between the unemployment rate and its longer -run normal level.20  In 
contrast to the other two rules, th e change rule does not take a stand on the value of the 
longer -run neutral level of the real federal funds rate,  thus avoiding  a potential source of 
error.  Instead, it moves inte rest rates up and down until both gaps close, an approach that 
in theory enables it to perform well when the true value of R*  is unknown.  Because both 
gaps are relatively modest at the moment  and are projected to remain so,  the change rule 
calls for fairly gradual adjustments in  the stance of monetary policy  over the next few 
years given the current outlook. 
                                                           
19 The balanced -approach rule is 𝑅𝑅 𝑡𝑡=𝑅𝑅∗+𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡+0.5(𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−𝜋𝜋∗)+1.0𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡, where all terms are defined as in 
the Taylor rule.  (See note 12 for details.)  As noted by Taylor (1999), research suggests that this rule may 
do a better job than the Taylor rule in stabilizing real activity and inflation.  
20 The change rule is 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡=𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡−1+1.2(𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−2)+2.0(𝑈𝑈∗−𝑈𝑈𝑡𝑡), where R is the federal funds rate, π is four -
quarter rate of core PCE inflation, U*  is the projected longer -run unemployment rate, and U  is the current 
unemployment rate.  In computing the prescriptions for the change rule shown in figure 8, the midpoint  of 
the target range for the federal funds rate prior to the December 2016 FOMC meeting, 0.38  percent, is used 
as the starting point.  For a discussion of this rule (and of policy rules in general), see Taylor and Williams 
(2010).   - 15 - 
 
The FOMC , for reasons that I  have discussed, does not base its decisions on the 
prescriptions of any specific  policy rule.  Nevertheless , the three benchmarks I have 
described --the Taylor rule, the balanced -approach rule, and the change rule, appropriately 
calibrated --have historically provided useful guidance about appropriate adjustments in 
the general direction  of monetary policy over time.  This guidance is illustr ated by 
figure  9, which compares the path of the federal funds rate since 2000 with the 
prescriptions of the three rules, based on the actual rates of inflation  and unemployment 
observed at each point in time, along with contemporaneous Blue Chip projectio ns of the 
longer-run unemployment rate and R*.   
As the figure shows, t he rules clearly signaled that a major reduction in the 
federal funds rate was appropriate in 2008 given the marked deterioration in economic 
conditions.  In addition, all three rules signaled that monetary policy needed to provide 
more stimulus during the recession and the subsequent recovery than could be provided 
by keeping short -term interest rates near zero.  For this reason, the Committee turned to 
asset purchases to help make up for the shortfall  by putting additional downward pressure 
on long er-term interest rates .  The FOMC al so sought to compensate for its inability to 
push the federal funds rate below zero by indicating that the funds rate would need to stay 
unusually low for longer than would otherwise be expected and simple policy rules would prescribe .
21  Under  this “make up” strategy, and taking into account the reasons 
for deviating from the Taylor rule that I discussed a moment ago, the Committee kept the 
                                                           
21 For examp le, the FOMC  advised in the statement released after its December 2012 m eeting that 
conditions  would likely warrant keeping the funds rate near zero at least as long as the unemplo yment rate 
was above 6 -1/2 percent --a threshold that was not passed until mid -2014.  As discussed by Reifschneider 
and Williams (2000), Werning (2012), and Woodford (2012), this type of lower -for-longer guidance can 
help compensate for the constraint on monetary policy created by the zero lower bound on nominal interest 
rates.  Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider (2015) find that the FOMC’s guidance, together with its asset 
purchases, provided significant economic stimulus in the years following the financial crisis.  - 16 - 
 
federal funds rate near zero for longer than two of the rules would have prescribed.  But 
as labor market conditions continued to improve over time, the rising trajectories for the 
federal funds rate prescri bed by all three rules  signaled that the time was  drawing near to 
begin gradually reducing  monetary accommodation.  Consistent with this advice, the 
FOMC suspended its asset purchase program in mid- 2014 and began raising the federal 
funds rate in late 2015.22   
To sum up, simple policy rules can serve as useful benchmarks to help assess how 
monetary policy should be adjusted over time.  However, their prescriptions must be interpreted carefully, both because estimates of some of their key inputs can vary significantly and because the rules often do not take into account important considerations  and information pertaining to the outlook.  For these reasons, the rules 
should not be followed mechanically, since  doing so could have adverse consequences 
for the economy.  
Conclusion  
My remarks have focused on the policy trajectory that the Committee now 
considers likely to be appropriate to sustain the economic expansion while keeping inflation close to our 2 percent  goal.  In concluding, i t is important to emphasize  the 
considerable uncertaint y that attach es to such assessment s and the need to constantly 
update them.     
In particular , the path of the neutral federal funds rate, which plays an important 
role in determining the appropriate policy path, is highly uncertain.  For example, productivity growth i s a key determinant of the neutral rate , and while most forecasters  
                                                           
22 For a closer look at the FOMC’s policy actions in 2016 and their relationship  to previous forecasts and 
subsequent changes in economic conditions , see Nechio and Rudebusch (2016).  - 17 - 
 
expect productivity growth to pick up from its recent unusually slow pace, the timing of 
such a pickup is highly uncertain.  Indeed, there is little consensus among researchers about the causes of the recent slowdown in productivity growth that  has occurred  both at 
home and abroad.
23  The strength of global growth will also have an  important bearing on 
the neutral rate through both trade and financial channels , and here , too, t he scope for 
surprises is considerable.   Finally, I would mention the potential for changes in fiscal  
policy to affect the economic outlook and the appropriate policy path .  At this point, 
however, the size, timing , and  composition of such changes remain uncertain.24  
However, as this discussion highlights, the course of monetary policy over the next few years will depend on many different factors, of which fiscal policy is just one. 
 
                                                           
23 To sample some of the different views about the sources of the recent slowdown in productivity growth 
and the prospects for faster growth in the future , see Gordon (2016), Fernald and Wang ( 2015), 
Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2014) , and Decker and others (2016, forthcoming).  
24 A related source of uncertainty is the limited ability of economists to predict the effects of specific 
changes in tax policy or government spending on the overall economy .  In part , this uncertainty arises  
because the net effect depends to some extent on the response of financial markets ; in addition, estimates 
vary considerably on the economic effects of changes in marginal tax rates or different types of spending.   - 18 -

The c oronavirus  has left a devastating human and economic toll in its wake as it 
has spread around the globe.  This is a worldwide public health crisis , and health -care 
workers have been the first responders, showing courage and deter mination and earning 
our lasting gratitude.  So have the legions of other essential workers who put themselves 
at risk every day on our behalf. 
As a nation, we have temporarily withdrawn from many kinds of economic and 
social activity  to help slow the spre ad of the virus.  S ome sectors of the economy have 
been effectively closed  since mid -March .  People have put their lives and livelihoods on 
hold, making enormous sacrifices to protect not just their own health and that of their loved ones, but also their neighbors and the broader community.  While we are all 
affected, the burden has  fallen most  heavily on those least able to bear it.   
The scope and speed of this downturn are without modern precedent, significantly 
worse than any recession since World War I I.  We are seeing a severe decline in 
economic activity and in employment, and already the job gains of the past decade have been erased.  Since the pandemic arrived in force just two months ago, more than 20 million people have lost their jobs.  A Fed sur vey being released tomorrow reflects 
findings similar to many others:  A mong people who were working in February, almost 
40 percent of those in households making less than $40,000 a year had lost a job in 
March .
1  This reversal of economic fortune has caused a level of pain that is hard to 
capture in words, as lives are upended amid great uncertainty about the future.

Decisionmaking ( forthcoming ) and  its Report on the Economic Well -Being of U.S. Households in 2019, 
Featuring Supplemental Data from April 2020 (forthcoming ).   - 2 - 
This downturn is different fr om those that came before it.  Earlier in the 
post–  World War II period, recessions were sometimes linked to a cycle of high inflation 
followed by Fed tightening.2  The lower inflation levels of recent decades have brought a 
series of long expansions, often accompanied by the buildup of imbalances over time —
asset prices that reached unsupportable levels, for instance, or important sectors of the 
economy, such as housing, that boomed unsustainably.  The current downturn is unique 
in that it is attributable to the virus and the steps taken to limit its fallout.  This time, high inflatio n was not a problem.  There was n o economy- threatening bubble to pop and no 
unsustainable boom to bust.  The virus is the cause, not the usual suspects —something 
worth keeping in mind as we respond. 
Today I will briefly discuss the measures taken so far to offset the economic 
effects of t he virus, and the path ahead.  Governments around the world have responded 
quickly with measures to support workers who have lost income and businesses that have either closed or seen a sharp drop in activity.  The response here in the United States has been particularly swift and forceful.  
To date, Congress has provided roughly $2.9 trillion in fiscal support for 
households, businesses, health -care providers, and state and local governments —about 
14 percent  of gross domestic product .  While the coronavirus  economic shock appears to 
be the largest on record, the fiscal response has also been the fastest and largest response for any postwar downturn. 
At the Fed, we have also acted with unprecedented speed and force.  After rapidly 
cutting the federal funds ra te to close to zero, we took a wide array of additional 
                                                 
2 Romer and Romer , 1989.   - 3 - 
measures to facilitate the flow of credit in the economy, which can be grouped into four 
areas.  First, outright purchases of Treasuries and agency mortgage -backed securit ies to 
restore functionality in these critical markets.  Second, liquidity and funding measures , 
including discount window measures, expanded swap lines with foreign central banks, and several facilities with Treasury backing to support smooth functioning in money markets.  Third, wit h additional backing from the Treasury, facilities to more directly 
support the flow of credit to households, businesses, and state and local governments.  And fourth, temporary regulatory adjustments to encourage and allow banks to expand their balance sh eets to support their household and business customers.   
The Fed takes actions such as these only in extraordinary circumstances, like 
those we face today.  For example, our authority to extend credit directly to private nonfinancial businesses and state and local governments exists only in “unusual and exigent circumstances” and with the consent of the Secretary of the Treasury.  When this 
crisis is behind us, we will put these emergency tools away.  
While the economic response has been both timely and appropriately large, it may 
not be the final chapter, given that the path ahead is both highly uncertain and subject to significant downside risks.  Economic forecasts are uncertain in the best of times, and today the virus raises a new set of questions :  How quickly and sustainably will it be 
brought under control?  Can new outbreaks be avoided as social -distancing measures 
lapse?  How long will it take for confidence to return and normal spending to resume?  And what will be the scope and timing of new thera pies, testing, or a vaccine?  The 
answers to these questions will go a long way toward setting the timing and pace of the  - 4 - 
economic recovery.  Since the answers are currently unknowable, policies will need to be 
ready to address a range of possible outcomes.   
The overall policy response to date has provided a measure of relief and stability, 
and will provide some support to the recovery when it comes.  But the c oronavirus crisis 
raises longer -term concerns as well.  The record shows that deeper and longer r ecessions 
can leave behind lasting damage to the productive capacity of the economy.3  Avoidable 
household and business insolvencies can weigh on growth for years to come.  Long stretches of unemployment can damage or end workers’ careers as their skills l ose value 
and professional networks dry up, and leave families in greater debt.
4  The loss of 
thousands of s mall- and medium -sized businesses across the country would destroy the 
life’s work and family legacy of many business and community leaders and limi t the 
strength of the recovery when it comes.  These businesses are a principal source of job creation —something we will sorely need as people seek to return to work.   A prolonged 
recession and weak recovery could also discourage business investment and expansion, 
further limiting the resurgence of j obs as well as the growth of capital stock and the pace 
of technological advance ment.  The result could be an extended period of low 
productivity growth and stagnant incomes .  
We ought to do what we can to avo id these outcomes, and that may require 
additional policy measures.  At the Fed, we will continue to use our tools to their fullest 
until the crisis has passed and the economic recovery is well under  way.  Recall that the 
Fed has lending powers, not spendi ng powers.  A loan from a Fed facility can provide a 
                                                 
3 For example, see Reifschneider , Wascher, and Wilcox , 2015; Blanchard and Summers , 1987 ; and Martin, 
Munyan, and Wilson , 2014 , 2015 .

bridge across temporary interruptions to liquidity, and those loans will help many 
borrowers get through the current crisis.  But the recovery may take some time to gather momentum, and the passage of ti me can turn liquidity problems into solvency problems.  
Additional fiscal support could be costly, but worth it if it helps avoid long- term 
economic damage and leaves us with a stronger recovery.  This tradeoff is one for our elected representatives, who w ield powers of taxation and spending.   
Thank you.  I look forward to our discussion.

Good afternoon.  I am pleased to participat e in the Cleveland C linic’s “Ideas for 
Tomorrow” series.  My public remarks ofte n concern short-run economic developments, 
but it is important once in a while to place thos e shorter-term developments in the context 
of the powerful long-term trends shaping the global economy.  Of these trends, surely one 
of the most important is the rapid and sustained economic growth achieved by the 
emerging market economies.  Today, by some  measures at least, developing and 
emerging market economies now account for more than one-half of global economic 
activity, up substantia lly from less than one-third in 1980.1  Today I will discuss what the 
experience of the emerging markets teaches us  about the sources of economic growth and 
conclude with some thoughts about the prospects fo r future growth in th is critical part of 
the global economy. 
Among the emerging market economies, the As ian “growth miracle” is, of course, 
the most conspicuous success story, with the ca se of China being particularly dramatic.  
Over the past three decades, growth in Chinese output per person has averaged roughly 
9 percent a year, putting per capita output about 13 times higher now than in 1980.  The 
economy of Korea, another East Asian success story, has expanded, on average, at better 
than a 6 percent annual rate ov er the past 30 years.  Growth in Latin America has been 
more moderate, but that continent has made substantial economic progress as well, most 
notably in terms of lower inflation and great er economic stability.  More recently, the 
                                                             
1 Based on gross domestic product (GDP) data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), with the 
valuation of a country’s GDP based on purchasing power parity exchange rates.  The emerging market and 
developing economies group used here includes the IMF’s classification of newly industrialized Asian 
economies.  There is no consensus definition of emer ging economies, as contrasted with developing 
economies, but generally speaking, emerging market eco nomies are defined as those economies in the low- 
to middle-income category that are advancing rapidly and are integrating with global capital and product 
markets.  Emerging economies account for most of the rise in the share of the developing and emerging 
economies in global output, and they  are the focus of this speech.   - 2 - 
 
 
 pace of recovery in most emerging market ec onomies from the global financial crisis has 
been impressive.  In short, in the past few decades the emerging market economies have made significant strides in raising living sta ndards.  Hundreds of millions of people have 
benefited from this progress, with many millions lifted out of poverty.
2  To be sure, the 
gap with the advanced economies remains substantial, but it has been narrowed 
significantly.  
These developments raise the questio n:  How have the emerging market 
economies achieved such strong results in rece nt decades?  The answer is complex, of 
course, and I can only scratch the surface of thes e issues today; but I hope to lay out some 
key themes and provide some food for thought. 
Fostering Growth in Developing Ec onomies:  The Washington Consensus 
Ironically, the rapid growth of the emergi ng market economies reflects in part the 
low levels of development at which they began.  In the economic-growth derby, in 
contrast to most types of competitions, star ting from far behind has its advantages.  For 
example, all else being equal, domestic and foreign investors are attracted to the higher 
returns they receive from investments where capital is relatively scarce, as is generally 
the case in poorer countries.  In the 19th cen tury, the United States drew capital from all 
over the world to finance railroad constructio n; although not all of these investments paid 
off, overall they helped generate enormous  increases in wealth by reducing transport 
costs and fostering economic integration within the North American continent.  Similarly, emerging market economies in recent decad es have attracted substantial foreign 
investment in new manufacturi ng capacity, in part to take ad vantage of low labor costs.  
                                                             
2 According to data from World Bank Development Indicators, 2011, there were more than 500 million 
fewer people living below the $1.25 a day poverty line in 2005 than 25 years earlier.   - 3 - 
 
 
 Developing countries also ha ve the advantage of being able to import and adapt 
production technologies already in use in a dvanced economies.  And, indeed, empirical 
studies have found some tendency for countries  that start from further behind to grow 
faster than those that begin with higher incomes.3  
However, much of the national and regi onal variation in growth rates is not 
explained by initial economic conditions.  Notably, emerging Asian economies have 
tended to outperform, relative to what would be  predicted based solely  on their levels of 
income per person, say, 30 years ago.  And some of the poorest countries, including a 
number in Africa, have conti nued to grow relatively slowly.  So what factors--and what 
economic policies--differentiate the more succe ssful performers from  the less successful? 
A classic attempt to generalize about th e policies that best promote economic 
growth and development, and a useful star ting point for discussion, is the so-called 
Washington Consensus, articulated by  the economist John Williamson in 1990.4  Writing 
about Latin America, Williamson outlined a list of 10 broad policies to promote 
economic development that he judged as co mmanding, at the time he wrote, substantial 
support between both economists and policymakers.  Because these views were influential at major institutions like the Wo rld Bank located in Wash ington, this set of 
policies was dubbed the Washington Consensus. 
                                                             
3 The idea that levels of output per capita tend to conv erge across countries, whic h in turn implies that the 
countries that are initially the poores t tend to grow the fastest, is kno wn in the research literature as 
“absolute convergence.”  A more soph isticated variant of this idea is “conditional convergence,” which 
holds that convergence across countries holds only after we control appropriately for factors that affect the 
long-run level of output in each country, such as the domestic saving rate and the rate of population growth.  
Empirical analyses generally find somewhat mixed evidence for absolute convergence but fairly robust 
support for conditional convergence.  See, for example, Barro and Sa la-i-Martin (2004) and Durlauf, 
Johnson, and Temple (2005).  Ro drik (2011) and some others have  argued recently that absolute 
convergence holds at a more disaggregated level in the manufacturing sector.     
4 Williamson initially articulated the Washington Consensus in a speech in 1989, but the first written 
version appears in Williamson (1990).  See also Williamson (2004) for his views on the various 
interpretations given to his recommendations.      - 4 - 
 
 
 Williamson’s original list of recommendations  can usefully be divided into three 
categories:  first, steps to increase macroeconomic stability , such as reducing fiscal 
deficits (which had caused high inflation in many countries), broadening the tax base, and 
reallocating government resources to build hum an and physical capital; second, actions to 
increase the role of markets  in the economy, such as pr ivatization of public assets, 
appropriate deregulation, and the liberalization of trade, interest rates, and capital flows; 
and third, efforts to strengthen institutions  that promote investment, business formation, 
and growth, particularly by enhancing property rights and the rule of law.  
Aspects of the Washington Consensus have  stirred considerable controversy over 
the past two decades.5  Williamson himself viewed th e Consensus as an attempt to 
synthesize the conventional wisdom of economi sts and policymakers of the time, not as a 
roadmap or comprehensive strategy for devel opment.  I have introduced this framework 
here because it is a nice summa ry of the prevailing views of 20 years ago, a time when 
the most dramatic growth in emerging markets still lay several years in the future.  By 
comparing current views with those described by Williamson in 1990, and accepted by many, we may learn something about which id eas have held up and which have been 
modified or refuted by recent ev ents.  I will take in turn th e three groups of policies that 
make up the Washington Consensus. 
The first group of recommendations, as  I noted, comprised policies aimed at 
increasing macroeconomic stability.  In this  case there is little controversy.  Abundant 
evidence has linked fiscal discipline, low in flation, and a stable macroeconomic policy 
                                                             
5 Examples of critiques of the Washington Consensus include Burki and Perry (1998), Rodrik (2006), and 
Birdsall and others (2010).   - 5 - 
 
 
 environment to stronger, longe r-term growth in both emerging and advanced economies.6  
In particular, many emerging market economies in the 1990s emulated the success of the 
advanced economies in the 1980s in controlli ng inflation.  Over the years, the emerging 
market economies have also improved their fi scal management to the point that their 
fiscal positions are now often more favorable than those of some advanced economies.  
Improvements in macroeconomic management ha ve been particularly striking in Latin 
America, where large budget deficits and high inflation rates had produced costly swings 
in economic activity in previous decades.  Brazil, for example, suffered hyperinflation 
from 1986 to 1994, with several years of infla tion well in excess of 500 percent, but has 
maintained an average annual inflation rate  of about 5 percent since 2006, while (not 
coincidentally) reducing the ra tio of its budget deficit to its gross domestic product.  
Disciplined macroeconomic policies have al so supported growth in emerging markets by 
fostering domestic savings, stimulating cap ital investment (including foreign direct 
investment), and reducing the risk of financial instability. 
The second group of recommendations lis ted by Williamson emphasized the need 
for greater reliance on markets:  the fr eeing up of the economy through privatization, 
deregulation, and liberalization.  The basi c idea here has held up pretty well; most 
observers today would agree that carefully managed liberalization--the substitution of markets for bureaucratic control of the econom y--is necessary for sustained growth.  For 
example, trade liberalization measures, such as  the reduction of tariffs and the removal of 
                                                             
6 Fischer (1993) and Easterly (2001) document that poor growth is associated with high inflation, large 
budget deficits, and distorted foreign exchange markets.  Durlauf, Kourtellos, and Tan (2008), emphasizing techniques that take into account model uncertainty, also find considerable support for the importance of 
stable macroeconomic policies.  Fatas and Mihov (2009)  establish that stability of policy is a relevant and 
robust determinant of cross-country differences in growth.  Easterly and Levine (1997) link much of the plight of Africa to macroeconomic instability.      - 6 - 
 
 
 other controls on exports and imports, have b een a key element of the growth strategies 
of a number of fast-growing emergi ng market economies, including China.7  Openness to 
inflows of foreign direct investment has helped many emerging economies import foreign 
management techniques and technologies as well as to attract foreign capital.  More 
generally, greater use of markets improves the allocation of resources, creates incentives 
for more efficient forms of production, and en courages entrepreneur ship and innovation.  
However, as I will discuss in a moment, experience has also shown that the success of reform programs may depend crucially on how th e transition to greater market orientation 
is managed, and in particular on how market  reforms are sequenced, issues on which the 
Washington Consensus is largely silent.  
The third part of the Washington Cons ensus focused on strengthening property 
rights and the rule of law--for  example, through effective enforcement of contracts.  The 
evidence suggests that these factors t oo can be important for development.
8  For example, 
the inability to establish clear title to land or build ings has inhibited en trepreneurship and 
investment in some poor countries.  On the other hand, some critics fault the Washington 
Consensus for paying insufficient attention to  the role in economic growth of a much 
broader range of institutiona l factors than property rights alone--standardi zed accounting 
conventions, political accountability, control of corruption, bankruptcy laws, and capable 
and transparent regulatory agencies, for example.9  Moreover, the Washington Consensus 
provided little specific advi ce on how to create and sust ain a strong institutional 
                                                             
7 See, for example, Chapter 5 of World Bank (2005).  Earlier studies documenting the importance of trade 
openness for growth include Sachs and Warner (1995, 1997) and Frankel and Romer (1999).      
8 For example, Kaufmann and others (2002) provide some evidence linking economic development to the 
presence of institutions that promote the rule of law.  
9 Burki and Perry (1998) and Rodrik (2006) are among those who argue that the Washington Consensus did 
not sufficiently emphasize the development of institutions.   - 7 - 
 
 
 framework, nor did it touch on a variety of  institutional arrangements--central bank 
independence being one familiar example--tha t have been shown to promote economic 
stability and growth.10 
Amending the Washington Consensus 
Overall, some key elements of the Wa shington Consensus appear well supported 
both by basic economic logic and by their successful application by a number of 
countries.  However, the experience of the past two decades also suggests some lessons 
that augment or modify what we thought we  knew about economic development in 1990.  
I will highlight three specific lessons. 
First, the implementation  of the Washington Consensus recommendations is 
important and not so straightforw ard in practice.  In particular , as I alluded to earlier, the 
sequencing of reforms matters.  For exampl e, some developing countries, following the 
principles of liberalization and deregulation, removed controls on the inflows of foreign 
capital, and foreign investors responded by pouring in funds.  However, the banking 
systems and the associated regulatory and supe rvisory agencies in these countries were 
not always well prepared to manage these ca pital inflows.  Consequently, some of the 
foreign capital was badly invested, which in  turn contributed to emerging-market 
financial crises, like those in Mexico and em erging Asia in the 1990s.  This experience 
suggests that measures to strengthen banks  and bank regulation should be put in place 
before the domestic market is opened to capital flows from abroad.   
                                                             
10 On the lack of specific advice on creating the prop er institutional framework, see, for example, Rodrik 
(2011).  On the benefits of central bank independen ce, see, for example, Ales ina and Summers (1993) and 
Cukierman and others (2002).  - 8 - 
 
 
 Similarly, dismantling controls on the dom estic financial industry has proven 
counterproductive when important compleme ntary factors--such as effective bank 
supervision, the availability  of bank managers trained in market-based lending, or 
consumer familiarity with financial products such as credit cards--were absent.  For example, Korea experienced a mini financia l crisis in early 2003, resulting from a 
massive run-up in household debt.  In the wake of policy changes to liberalize and 
increase competition in domestic financial mark ets, credit card debt in Korea as a share 
of its gross domestic product more than tripled between 1999 and 2002, as the average 
number of credit cards for every adult in  the country rose from 1 to 3.  Korea’s 
consumers, lenders, and regulators had li ttle experience with credit cards, and 
institutional arrangements for sharing data on consumer credit, including credit reports, 
were inadequate.  Not surprisingly, at leas t in retrospect, delinquency rates soared, 
putting the solvency of a number of the country ’s major financial inst itutions at risk.  The 
broader lesson is that institutional arra ngements, ranging from accounting rules to 
regulatory frameworks to tax-compliance tools, must be sufficiently developed to ensure 
that reforms are successful.  Fortunately, even  in the absence of a clear consensus on how 
best to sequence and implement reforms, many countries have successfully promoted growth through a slow and pragmatic but continuing process of  liberalization.  
A second important lesson of the past tw o decades involves the pivotal role of 
technology  in economic development.  For emerging market economies, which tend to 
lag behind in technological s ophistication, rapid gains in pr oductivity can be achieved by 
adapting state-of-the-art technologies al ready developed by the advanced economies 
rather than by having to develop these t echnologies from scratch.  But successful - 9 - 
 
 
 importing of technologies does not happen auto matically or without preparation.  For 
example, strong educational systems produci ng increasingly skilled workforces have 
proven crucial for climbing the technological ladder.  In the United States, substantial 
increases in educational attainment from the beginning of the 20th century through the 
period following World War II were instru mental in driving economic growth.11  
In the emerging market world, India’s information technology (IT) services 
industry has thrived in large part because of  the country’s large supply of well-educated, 
English-speaking workers.  And it is not just higher education that matters.  Encouraging 
basic levels of literacy is critical as well.   Promising programs in some emerging market 
countries, such as Brazil and Mexico, provide  modest amounts of money to poor families 
(generally to women) on the condition that their children attend school regularly and 
receive basic health care.  The evidence sugge sts that these programs enhance the quality 
of the economy’s labor force  while addressing soci al goals such as reducing gender and 
income inequality.    
Many emerging market economies have also harnessed internati onal trade as an 
engine of technical progress.  Openness to trade has allowed these countries to import 
state-of-the-art capital goods, and vigorous international competition has increased the 
efficiency of domestic firms and facilita ted the transfer of skills and knowledge.  
International trade has also helped shift th ese economies away from basic agriculture 
toward manufacturing, with subs tantial benefits for average productivity.  These benefits 
                                                             
11 Research by Goldin and Katz (2001) emphasizes the importance of the U.S. high school system in 
driving the country’s growth during the first decades of the 20th century.  The state-supported university 
system and the educational subsidies of the G.I. Bill boosted educational attainment and growth after World 
War II.  (See, for example, Altschuler  and Blumin (2009).)  It should be  noted that increasing the share of 
the public budget devoted to education was advocated by the Washington Consensus. - 10 - 
 
 
 of trade openness do not require large trade surpluses, by the way, only a willingness to 
engage with and integrate with the global economy.  Notably, Korea ran current account 
deficits through much of its “gro wth miracle” phase.        
A third important lesson that has come into sharper focus, and which was not 
fully appreciated by the Washington Consen sus, involves the capacity to draw on 
economies of scale  to accelerate the pace of techni cal progress and economic growth.  
Economies of scale refer to the efficiency gains that can be achieved in some industries 
when production is run at a very  large scale.  These gains ma y arise because of the nature 
of the technologies involved--as, for example, in steel manufacturing.12  But in some 
cases they can also arise because of the need to develop a critical mass of skilled workers and specialized suppliers.  It is no coincide nce that so many high-tech firms locate near 
each other in California’s Silicon Valley or North Carolina’s Research Triangle; these 
firms benefit from the ability to draw on suffi ciently large pools of skilled labor and other 
resources, while sharing ideas and info rmation in mutually beneficial ways.
13  A single, 
isolated firm would not likely be as productiv e.  Thus, scale economi es can arise in the 
development of knowledge centers, like research universities, or in the building of large-
scale infrastructure, like a national highway system.14  For example, India’s IT industry is 
clustered in certain regions, such as Banga lore, around some of th e more successful and 
high-quality institutes of technology in the coun try.  Moreover, recent research suggests 
that the growth of information technology act ivity in India has in creased returns to 
                                                             
12 In such cases we call th em “natural monopolies.”  
13 This idea whereby economies of scale can be co ntinuously exploited by the sharing of ideas and 
“learning-by-doing” is one source of what is called “endogenous growth” in the economics literature.  See, 
for example, Romer (1986) and Lucas  (1988).  While the idea of “natur al monopolies” was well understood 
at the time the Washington Consensus came out, the “endogenous growth” literature was in its infancy.   
14 See, for example, Barro (1990).   - 11 - 
 
 
 schooling and has significantly increased prim ary school enrollment in areas where call 
centers are located.15   
Encouraging international trade can also help countries capture the benefits of 
scale.  For many emerging market economies, domestic markets are not large enough to 
support the amount of production ne eded to achieve efficiency gains.  Access to global 
markets has enabled production to expand to levels where economies of scale could be 
more fully exploited.  Additional efficiencies  can sometimes be gained when countries 
specialize in particular stag es of a good’s production.  They import parts and components 
from other countries and use them to produce new products, which themselves may be further processed or assembled in still other co untries.  At each stage, the production is 
for the world market rather than for domes tic producers or consumers alone.  Many Asian 
economies are interlinked thr ough a network of vertical s upply chains; China is often 
referred to as the endpoint in the global s upply chain because the assembly of so many 
goods is completed there before being shipped to consumers around the world. 
The existence of economies of  scale may, in some circ umstances, also create a 
rationale for targeted government interv entions in the economy--in other words, 
industrial policy.  The premise of  industrial policy is that la rge-scale industries may not 
be able to get off the ground without gove rnment support or protection, given the 
substantial start-up costs and the existence of more-efficient competitors in other countries.  Indeed, government support for cert ain industries does seem to have played a 
role in several of the best-performing em erging market economies, including China and

 Korea.16  But such interventions can be double- edged swords.  The experience of many 
decades tells us that industri al policies are far from a sure-fire development strategy, as 
they require that the government be adept at picking winners.  One example, the role of 
government intervention in promoting etha nol production in Brazil, illustrates the 
vagaries of industrial policies .  After being introduced ove r the mid- to late 1970s, for 
several years the program was generally viewed  as a failure.  More recently, however, the 
sustained upward trend in world oil prices has turned ethanol production in Brazil into a 
profitable venture.17  But in many cases, similar interv entions have failed or crowded out 
the development of other, potentially  more profitable industries.  
Lessons and Implications for the Future  
What implications can we draw for l onger-term prospects for growth in the 
emerging market economies?  Notwithstanding the recent impressive growth, output per 
person in the emerging market economies ge nerally remains much lower than in the 
advanced economies.  This fact suggests th at the emerging market economies should be 
able to maintain relatively high growth rates fo r some years to come, as they continue to 
catch up to the advanced economies.  But ove r time, as the emerging market countries 
become wealthier and technologically more s ophisticated, they will gradually lose the 
advantages of starting from behind.  Even w ith continued strong po licies, their growth 
will slow as returns to capital investments di minish and the most profitable opportunities 
are exploited. 18  For example, over time, rising wages in manufacturing should make 
                                                             
16 Rodrik (2010), for example, discusses China’s case.     
17 After 1989, ethanol subsidies in Brazil were removed, but other forms of indirect government support 
were maintained.  
18 Recent research by Eichengreen and others (2011) dr aws on cross-country evidence to show that the pace 
of a country’s economic growth tends to slow once its level of real per capita income crosses a certain 
threshold. - 13 - 
 
 
 production and investment in China and other East Asian nations le ss attractive.  Also, 
technological progress will slow as the proce ss of importing foreign technologies reaches 
its limits, forcing greater reliance on innova tion in emerging countries themselves.  
Resource and environmental constraints, as we ll as aging populations , should also slow 
economic growth.  But in many ways, such a slowdown in growth will be the inevitable 
result of progress--the culmination of a successful catching up process--and in that 
respect should be viewed as a conseq uence of success, not of failure.  
Many emerging markets also will be challe nged by their reliance on trade to drive 
growth.  As I have discussed, international trade has many benefits.  However, generating 
trade surpluses by suppressing domestic demand defeats the ultimate purpose of economic growth--improving the lot of the count ry’s own citizens.  Large and persistent 
imbalances in trade are also inconsistent , in the long run, with  global economic and 
financial stability.  Of course, the advanced  economies, like the United States, need to do 
their part as well in reducing global imbalan ces, as I have noted on numerous occasions 
before.  
In fact, with the emerging market econo mies accounting for a large and growing 
share of global activity, many of them can no longer view themselves as small, open 
economies whose actions have l ittle effect on their neighbors.   With increasing size and 
influence comes greater respons ibility.  In response to th is new reality, many of our 
international institutions have been restructured in recent y ears to give an increased voice 
to the emerging market economies.  For ex ample, the Group of Twenty (which has 
significant emerging market repr esentation) has largely suppla nted the Group of Seven as 
the premier global forum for economic and fi nancial policy matters, and emerging market - 14 - 
 
 
 economies have been given increased power in  setting the policies of  the International 
Monetary Fund.  These forums should be used by advanced economies and emerging 
economies alike to meet their respective respon sibilities to the global economy in a spirit 
of cooperation.   
So, what lessons can we draw about the Washington Consensus and, more 
generally, about the experien ce of the dynamic emerging mark et economies over the past 
decades?  Ultimately, the principles that John Williamson enumerated two decades ago have much to recommend them.  Macroeconom ic stability, increased  reliance on market 
forces, and strong political and economic institutions are important for sustainable growth.  However, with the experience and pe rspective of the past 20 years, we can see 
that Williamson’s recommendations were not complete.  Reforms must be sequenced and implemented appropriately to have their desi red effects.  And a successful development 
framework must take into account that activ ities such as the adaptation of advanced 
technologies and the harnessing economies of s cale are often critical to economic growth 
and depend on a host of institut ional conditions, such as an educated workforce, to be 
fully effective.    
Indeed, advanced economies like the Un ited States would do well to re-learn 
some of the lessons from the experiences of  the emerging market economies, such as the 
importance of disciplined fiscal policies, the be nefits of open trade, the need to encourage 
private capital formation while undertaki ng necessary public investments, the high 
returns to education and to promoting technological advan ces, and the importance of a 
regulatory framework that encourages entrep reneurship and innovation while maintaining 
financial stability.  As the advanced econom ies look for ways of enhancing longer-term - 15 - 
 
 
 growth, a re-reading of Williamson’s original Washington Consensus, combined with 
close attention to the experi ences of successful emerging market economies, could pay 
significant dividends. - 16 -

Providence Chamber of Commerce

May 22 , 2015  
   
Good afternoon.  I am pleased to be with you, and it is good to be back in 
Providence.  As many of you know, I attended Brown University, and the city I see today 
is very different from the one I remember from my time here in the 1960s.  Many of 
those differences reflect dramatic and , at times , wrenching economic changes in Rhode 
Island over those years, especially since the financial crisis and the Great Recession.  As ever, Providence has faced these challenges, and I am impressed by  the revival and 
renewal evident downtown, encouraged by attractions  like Waterfire, which bring visitors 
and commerce here and build civic pride. 
Today I would like to speak with you about the outlook for the U.S. economy .  I 
should note at the outset tha t my remarks today reflect my own views and not necessarily 
those of others in the Federal Reserve System.  
The R ecession and the R ecovery S o Far 
As you all know, the economy is still recovering from the Great Recession, the 
worst downturn since the terribl e episode  of the 1930s that inspired its name.  The 
recession began more than seven  years ago, the result of the collapse in the housing 
market and the financial crisis that it sparked.  Rhode Islanders are well aware of the great toll taken by the recession.  The unemployment rate hit 10 percent nationally, and it reached 11.3  percent here in Rhode Island.  Nationally, payrolls shrank by some 8- 1/2 
million, about 6 percent, and the 41,000 jobs lost in Rhode Island represented close to 8 percent of the state’s employment .  U.S. e conomic output fell more than 4 percent 
nationally, the most since the Great Depression,  and many of the hardest -hit industries ,  - 2 - 
including housing construction and manufacturing, are important to the Rhode Island 
economy.1  
The Federal Reserve took action to help stabilize the financial system during the 
crisis, and we have supported the economic recovery with monetary policy actions designed to hold down longer -term interest rates.  With this help,  the economy has made 
significant strides.  The pace of job gains has gradually strengthened, and payrolls 
expanded by more than 3 million in 2014 alone.  The unemployment rate has come down steadily to 5.4 percent in April.  One sign  of a stronger labor market is that the number of 
job openings has risen impressively , and another is that more workers are quitting their 
jobs, signaling  greater confidence in their ability to find a new job.   
Rhode Island is sharing in this recovery, but I am well aware that economic 
conditions rema in difficult here.  Rhode Island’s unemployment rate improved very 
slowly during the recovery , and, for a time, it was the highest of any state.  Th e jobless  
rate has come down a lot over the past year or so, but at 6.3 percent in March, 
unemployment here remains above the national average, and payroll employment has yet 
to regain its pre -recession  peak.   
In recent months , some economic data ha ve suggested that the pace of 
improvement in the economy may have slowed, a topic I will address in a moment.  And even with the significant gains of the past couple years, it is only now, six years after the recession ended, that  the labor market is  approaching its full strength.   
1 For a discussion of recent economic developments in Rhode Island, see Mary A. Burke (2014), “Rhode 
Island in the Great Recession:  Factors Contributing to Its Sharp Downturn and Slow Recovery,” Federal 
Reserve Bank of Boston, Current Policy Perspectives 1 4-9 (Boston:  FRB Boston, December), 
www.bostonfed.org/economic/current -policy -perspectives/2014/cpp1409.htm .                                                    - 3 - 
I say “approaching ,” because in my judgment we are not there yet.  The 
unemployment ra te has come down close to levels that many economists believe is 
sustainable in the long run without generating inflation.  But the unemployment rate 
today probably does not fully capture the extent of slack in the labor market.  To be classified as unempl oyed, people must report that they are actively seeking work, and 
many people without jobs say they are not doing so--that is, they are classified as being out of the labor force.  Most people out of the labor force are there voluntarily, including retirees, teenagers , young adults in school, and people staying home to care for children.  
But I also believe that a significant number are not seeking work because they still perceive a lack of good job opportunities.  
In addition to those too discouraged to seek work, an unusually large number of 
people report that they are working part time because they cannot find full -time jobs , and 
I suspect that much of this also represents labor market slack that could be absorbed in a 
stronger economy.  Finally, the generally disappointing pace of wage growth also suggests that the labor market has not fully healed.  Higher wages raise costs for employers, of course, but they also boost the spending and confidence of customers and would signal a strengthening of the recovery that will ultimately be good for business .  In 
the aggregate, the main measures of hourly compensation rose at a rate of only around 2 percent through most of the recovery.  And in Rhode Island, average hourly earnings have not risen at all in the past year.  Nationally, there are at least some encouraging 
signs of a pickup so far this year.
2  The fact that some large companies, such as Wal -Mart 
2 According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics ’ (BLS) employment cost index --which measures both wages 
and the cost of employer -provided benefits --hourly compensation in private industry rose 2 -3/4 percent 
over the year ended in March after having averaged gains of about 2 percent per year during most of t he 
recovery.  However, some other prominent aggregate wage measures have remained softer.  For example,                                                   - 4 - 
and Target, have announced wage increases for their employees also might be a sign that 
larger wage gains are on the horizon.  
This improvement in the labor market has brought the economy closer to one of 
the two goals of monetary policy assigned to the Fed by the Congress --maximum 
employment.  Less p rogress has been made toward the other goal, price stability .  
Consumer price inflation remains below the Fed’s stated objective of 2 percent.  The notion that inflation can be too low may sound odd, but over time low inflation means that wages as well as prices will rise by less, and very low inflation can impair the 
functioning of the economy --for example, by making it more difficult for households and 
firms to pay off their debts.  Overall consumer price inflation has been especially low --
close to zero --over the past year, a s the big fall in oil prices since last summer lowered 
prices for gasoline, heating oil, and other energy products.  But inflation excluding food and energy, which is often a better indicator of where overall inflation will be in the 
future, has also been low, below the Fed’s 2 percent objective both now and for almost all of the economic recovery .  Inflation has been held down by the continued economic 
weakness during the slow recovery and , more recently, by lower prices of imported 
goods as well as the fall in oil prices.  With oil prices no longer declining, and with the public’s expectations of future inflation apparently stable, my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and I believe that consumer price inflation will move up to 2 percent as the economy strengthens further and as other temporary factors weighing on inflation recede.   
the BLS’s average hourly earnings for all employees on nonfarm payrolls have increased 2 -1/4 percent over 
the 12 months through April.                                                    - 5 - 
A number of economic headwinds have slowed the recovery, and to some extent 
they continue to influence the outlook.  These headwinds include, first, the fac t that the 
housing crash left many households with less wealth and higher debt, weighing on 
consumer spending.  Many homeowners lost their homes , and many more ended up 
“underwater ,” owing more  on their mortgages  than their homes were worth .  Economists 
have noted that areas of the country that saw a larger boom and bust in housing have subsequently fared worse economically than other areas of the country.
3  Rhode Island is 
one such place.  While the housing bust was not as large here as in Florida, Nevad a, and 
parts of California, it was larger than average, and the largest in New England.  This  
factor  likely has contributed to the fact that the overall recovery here in Rhode Island has 
lagged.4  
In some respects , this headwind has diminished.  Home price s have moved up 
appreciably  in m any areas of the country, alleviating the burden for many homeowners , 
though the improvement in some areas, including Rhode Island, has lagged .  Nationally, 
the share of mortgages that are underwater fell by about one- half b etween 2011 and 
2014.5  And credit availability for mortgages has improved as well, although mortgages 
are still very hard to obtain for would- be homeowners without pristine credit records.  So 
I would score this headwind as still a concern, but one that i s likely to continue to fade.  
A second headwind, also quite important here in Rhode Island, has come from 
changes in fiscal policy  to reduce budget deficits .  At the federal level, the fiscal stimulus 
3 See Atif Mian and Amir Sufi (2014), House of Debt:  How They (and You) Caused the Great Recession, 
and How We Can Prevent It from Happening Again (Chicago:  University of Chicago Press).  
4 See Burke, “Rhode Island in the Great Recession,” in note 1.  
5 The share varies b y source of data.  According to Zillow’s October 2014 Real Estate Market Overview , 
the share of mortgages in negative equity positions declined from about 30 percent in 2011 to 17 percent in 
2014.  According to CoreLogic’s 4th quarter 2014 Equity Report , the share declined from about 25 percent 
to 11 percent over that period.                                                    - 6 - 
of 2008 and 2009 supported economic output , but the ef fects of that stimulus faded ; by 
2011, federal fiscal policy actions became a drag on output growth when the recovery 
was still weak .  Meanwhile, states and municipalities, faced with serious budget problems 
due to the recession and required by law to bala nce their budgets, were forced to cut 
spending and raise taxes.  T he recovery has by now boosted tax revenue  in most states , 
though Rhode Island, I know, is among those areas  still facing considerable budget strain.  
Overall, fiscal policy actions at both the federal and the state and local levels look like 
they are no longer a significant drag on economic growth.  So this headwind, I hope, is 
mostly behind us.  
A third headwind has been the restraining influences on the U nited S tates from 
the global economy.  I won’t say as much about this factor today , but I will  make just a 
few observations.  Initially the euro- area crisis was the biggest headwind coming from 
the rest of the world.  Supported by monetary stimulus, reduced fiscal dra g, and 
significant institutional reforms, the recovery in the euro area now appears to be on a 
firmer footing.  However, growth in many other parts of the global economy, including China and some other emerging market economies, has slowed.  Weak growth abroad, together with its accompanying implications for exchange rates , has dented U.S. exports 
and weighed on our economy.  This headwind too should abate as growth in the global economy firms, supported by monetary policies that generally remain highly accommodative.     
Factors A ffecting the O utlook  
With the waning of the headwinds that I have discussed, the U.S. economy seems 
well positioned for continued growth.  Households are seeing the benefits of the  - 7 - 
improving jobs situation, and consumer confidence has been solid.  In addition, the drop 
in oil prices amounts to a sizable boost in household purchasing power.  The annual savings in gasoline costs has been estimated at about $700 per household, on average, and savings on heating costs --especially her e in the Northeast , where it was so cold this 
winter --are also large.
6  Given these energy savings on top of the job gains, real 
disposable income  has risen almost 4 percent nationally over the past four quarters.  
Households and businesses also are benefi ting from favorable financial conditions.  
Borrowing costs are low, supported by the Fed’s accommodative monetary policies.  And credit availability to both households and small businesses has improved.  
In recent months , as I noted earlier, there has been some softness in the economic 
data.  Recent indicators of both household spending and business investment have slowed, and industrial output has declined.  The Commerce Department’s initial estimate was that real gross domestic product was nearly flat in t he first quarter of 2015.  If 
confirmed by further estimates, my guess is that this apparent slowdown was largely the result of a variety of transitory factors that occurred at the same time , includ ing the 
unusually cold and snowy winter and the labor disputes at ports on the West Coast, both 
of which likely  disrupted some economic activity.  And some of this apparent weakness 
may just be statistical noise.  I therefore expect the economic data to strengthen.   
All of that said, the headwinds facing our eco nomy have not fully abated, and, as 
such, I expect that continued growth in employment and output will be moderate over the remainder of the year and beyond.

Outlook  (Washington:  EIA, May), available at www.eia.gov/forecasts/steo .                                                   - 8 - 
Despite the recovery I noted in home prices and a greater number of home sales, 
residential cons truction activity remains quite low.  I mentioned the ongoing issues with 
mortgage credit, but more generally, many years of a weak job market and slow wage 
gains seem to have induced many people to double -up on housing, and many young 
adults  continue to l ive with their parents.  Population growth is creating a need for more  
housing, whether to rent or to own, and I do expect that continuing job and wage gains will encourage  more people to form new  households .  Nevertheless, activity in the 
housing sector i s likely to improve only gradually. 
The pace of business investment has also been only modest during this recovery, 
and some of the reasons might persist a while longer.  Businesses seem not to have had sufficient confidence in the strength and durability of the recovery to undertake 
substantial capital expenditures.  Moreover, some analysts have suggested that uncertainty, not only about the strength of the recovery but also about economic policy, 
could be a significant factor.  And the fact that many busi nesses seem to be holding large 
amounts of cash may suggest that risk aversion is playing a role.   
Weak investment in the energy sector is also likely to persist.  This represents the 
negative side to the fall in oil prices, one being felt by the oil- producing regions of the 
country.  New domestic oil drilling has plunged over the past few months, and we have also seen a slowdown in activity in sectors that supply oil production companies, including steel and certain types of machinery.  I would add, however, that , on balance , 
the plusses for energy consumers from the fall in oil  prices almost surely outweigh the 
minuses.  Remember that we are still a net importer of oil.   - 9 - 
Putting it all together, the economic projections of most members of the F OMC  
call for  growth in real gross domestic product  of roughly 2- 1/2 percent per year over the 
next couple of years, a little faster than the pace of  the recovery thus far, with the 
unemployment rate continuing to move down to near  5 percent by the end of this year.  
And for inflation, as I noted earlier, my colleagues and I expect inflation to move up 
toward our objective of 2 percent as the economy strengthens further and as transitory influences wane.  
Of course, the outlook for t he economy, as always, is highly uncertain.  I  am 
describing the outlook that I see as most likely, but based on many years of making economic projections, I can assure you that any specif ic projection I write down will turn 
out to be wrong, perhaps markedly so.  For many reasons, output and job growth over the next few years could prove to be stronger , and inflation higher , than I expect; 
correspondingly, employment could grow more slowly , and inflation could remain 
undesirably low.   
Implications for M onetary P olicy  
Given this economic outlook and the attendant uncertainty, how is monetary 
policy likely to evolve over the next few years?  Because of the substantial lags in the effects of monetary policy on the economy, we must make policy in a forward- looking 
manner.  Delaying action to tighten monetary policy until employment and inflation are already back to our objectives would risk overheating the economy.   
For this reason, if the economy continues to improve as I expect, I think it will be 
appropriat e at some point this year to take the initial step to raise the federal funds rate 
target and begin the process of normalizing monetary policy.  To support taking this step,  - 10 - 
however, I will need to see continued improvement in labor market conditions, and I will 
need to be reasonably confident that inflation will move back to 2 percent over the 
medium term.   
After we begin raising the federal funds rate,  I anticipate that the pace of 
normalization is likely to be gradual.  The various headwinds that are st ill restraining the 
economy, as I said, will likely take some time to fully abate, and the pace of that improvement is highly uncertain.  If conditions develop as my colleagues and I expect, then the FOMC’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability would best be achieved by proceeding cautiously, which I expect would mean that it will be several years before the federal funds rate would be back to its normal, longer -run level.   
Having said that, I should stress that the actual course of policy w ill be 
determined by incoming data and what that reveals about the economy.  We have no intention of embarking on a preset  course of increases in the federal funds rate after the 
initial increase.  Rather, we will adjust monetary policy in response to deve lopments in 
economic activity and inflation as they occur.  If conditions improve more rapidly than expected, it may be appropriate to raise interest rates more quickly; conversely, the pace of normalization may be slower if conditions turn out to be less favorable.  
Longer -Run G rowth  
Before I conclude, let me put this discussion into a longer -term context.  The 
Federal Reserve’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability do not, by themselves, ensure a strong pace of economic growth or an improve ment in living 
standards.  The most important factor determining living standards is productivity  - 11 - 
growth, defined as increases in how much can be produced in an hour of work.  Over 
time, sustained increases in productivity are necessary to support rising i ncomes. 
Here the recent data have been disappointing.  The growth rate of output per hour 
worked in the business sector has averaged about 1 -1/4 percent per year since the 
recession began in late 2007.  This rate is down from gains averaging 2- 3/4 percent over 
the preceding decade.  I have mentioned the tepid pace of wage gains in recent years, and while I do take this as evidence of slack in the labor market, it also may be a reflection of relatively weak productivity growth.  
Productivity depends on many f actors, including our workforce’s knowledge and 
skills and the quantity and quality of the capital, technology, and infrastructure that they have to work with.  Economists debate how optimistic to be about our nation’s productivity prospects.  Some argue t hat the decade starting in the mid -1990s was 
exceptional, with unusually large advances in information technologies, and that the more 
recent period provides a better guide to the future.  Others are more optimistic, suggesting that recent technological in novation remains as impressive as ever, and that history shows 
it may take some years to fully reap the economic benefits of such innovations.
7  I do not 
know who is right, but I do believe that, as a nation, we should be pursuing policies to 
7 For a relatively pessimistic view of productivity growth because “the low -hanging fruit is picked ,” see

Headwinds,” NBER Working Paper Series 18315 (Cambridge, Mass.:  National Bureau of Economic

support longe r-run growth in productivity.  Policies to strengthen education, to encourage 
entrepreneurship and innovation, and to promote capital investment, both public and 
private, can all be of great benefit.  
It also is possible that a portion of the relatively we ak productivity growth we 
have seen recently may be the result of the recession itself.8  Firms slashed their capital 
expenditures during the recession, and as I noted earlier, the increases in investment 
during the recovery have been modest.  In particula r, investment in research and 
development has been relatively weak.  Moreover, a lack of financing may have impaired 
the ability of people to start new businesses and implement new ideas and technologies.  As the economy strengthens further, many of these processes could work in reverse, boosting our productivity prospects.  To the extent this is so, Federal Reserve actions to strengthen the recovery may not only help bring our economy back to its productive potential, but it may also support the growth of productivity and living standards over the 
longer run.

Good morning, and welcome to the 10th annual Community Banking Research 
Conference.  I have attended this conference twice before, including the first one back in 
2013, and I can attest to the quality of the research and discussions.  While I am coming to you virtually today, many of you are gathering in person for the first time in three years.  I am sure it will make an excellent event even more enjoyable.  
The Community Banking Research Conference brings together researchers, 
regulators, policymakers, and community  bankers to discuss the unique and important 
role community banks play in our economy.  The conference was launched in the years following the financial crisis, in a collaboration by the Federal Reserve, the Conference of State Bank Supervisors  (CSBS) , and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
(FDIC) .  The conference was developed to deepen our understanding of the community 
bank business model and to provide a forum to discuss research with academics, 
policymakers, regulators, and community bankers.  
The r esearch presented over the years has informed supervisory and regulatory 
policy debates and continues to challenge our thinking.  It has highlighted the vital links between community banks and small businesses , the availability of credit in low - and 
modera te-income communities , how community banks support their local communities in 
times of crisis , and the impact of technology.  
A critical feature of the research sessions is that community  bankers join 
academic moderators to provide feedback from a practitio ner’s perspective.  The 
challenges facing community banks have changed significantly over the past 10 years.  Community banks have demonstrated remarkable resilience, and conferences like this have helped regulators and supervisors to better understand those changes.   - 2 - 
I want to congratulate the Federal Reserve Bank  of St. Louis for a decade of 
hosting an important and informative conference.  
And I want to thank our colleagues at the Fed, the FDIC , and the C onference of 
State B ank S upervisors .  On a sadder note, I want to recognize the passing of John Ryan, 
who was president  of the CSBS, this past May.  John’s impact on the CSBS and his 
contributions to the financial services sector overall were significant, and he is missed by 
all who knew and worked with him .  
Thanks also to the researchers and  all the community banking professionals for 
their insight and contributions over the years.  
Thank you all , and have a great conference . ",2022-09-28,powell

Panel on “Central Bank Independence and the Mandate —Evolving Views”  
   
Remarks by  
 
Jerome H. Powell

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  
 
at 
 
Symposium on Central Bank Independence  
Sveriges Riksbank 
 
Stockholm, Sweden 
       
January 10, 2023 
  
I will address  three main points.  First, the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy 
independence is an important and broadly supported institutional arrangement that has 
served the American public well.  Second, the Fed must continuously earn that independence by using our tools to achieve our assigne d goals of maximum employment 
and price stability, and by providing t ransparen cy to facilitate understanding and effective 
oversight by the public and their elected representatives in Congress .  Third, we should 
“stick to our knitting”  and not wander off t o pursue perceived social benefits  that are not 
tightly linked to our statutory goals and authorities .
 
Central bank independence and transparency  
On the first point, t he case for monetary policy independence lies in the benefits 
of insulating monetary poli cy decisions from short -term political considerations .1  Price 
stability is the bedrock of a healthy economy and provides the public with immeasurable benefits over time.  But restoring price stability when inflation is high can require  
measures that are not popular in the short term  as we raise interest rates to slow the 
economy.  The absence of direct political control over our decisions allows us to take  
these necessary measures without considering short -term political factors .  I believe that 
the benef its of independent monetary policy in the U.S. context are well understood and 
broadly accepted.
2 
 
1 In the past several decades, support for arrangements in which central banks made monetary policy 
decisions in  pursuit of legislated goals of economic and price stability has been  buttressed by theoretical 
and empirical research contributions, including by Kenneth Rogoff, on the benefits of central bank 
independence.  See Rogoff (1985)  as well as the discussion below of the distinction between goal 
independence and instrument independence .  With regard to empirical evidence  on the matter , see Alesina 
and Summers (1993) as well  as the subsequent research literature of the past three decad es, including 
Crowe and Meade (2008).  Bernanke (2010) and Tucker (2018) provide overviews of the development of 
central bank independence.  
2 Our situation is different from that of the European Central Bank, whose independence is enumerated in 
Article 130  of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union , which is available from the European 
Union at https://lexparency.org/eu/TFEU/ART_130 .  - 2 - 
In a well -functioning democracy, important public policy decisions should be 
made, in almost all cases, by the elected branches of government.  Grants of 
independence to agencies  should be exceedingly rare, explicit, tightly circumscribed, a nd 
limited to those issues that clearly warrant protection from short- term political 
considerations.  
With independence come s the responsibility to provide the transparency that 
enables effective oversight by Congress, which, in turn, supports the Fed’s democ ratic 
legitimacy.  At the Fed, we treat this as an active, not passive, responsibility, and over the past several decades we have steadily broadened our efforts to provide meaningful 
transparency about the basis for, and consequences of, the decisions we make in service to the American public.  We are tightly focused on achieving our statutory mandate and 
on providing useful and appropriate transparency .
3 
Sticking to our mandate  
It is essential  that we stick to our statutory goals  and authorities, and that we resist 
the temptation to broaden our scope to address  other important s ocial issues of the day.4  
Taking on new goals, however worthy, without a clear statutory mandate would undermine the case for our independence.  
 
3 We continue to strive to improve our transparency.  Over my five years as Chair, I have pursued this aim 
by extending postmeeting press conferences to all FOMC meetings and instituting ongoing personal 
dialogue with legislators.  This continuous dialogue goes well beyond the regular testimony, established by 
statute, in which I report to the congressional committees that have oversight responsibilities regarding 
monetary policy.  
4 Although the Federal Reserve has been independent since its inception in 1914, its dual mandate only 
became part of the law in 1977 (see Bernanke,  2010).  The existence of the dual mandate reflects the fact 
that the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy independence corresponds to operational, or instrument, 
independence, rather than goal independence.  See Debelle and Fischer (1994) for an analysis of the 
distinction between types of independence.   - 3 - 
In the area of bank regulation, too, the Fed has a degree of independence, as do 
the other federal bank regulators.  Independence in this area helps ensure that the public 
can be confident that our supervisory decisions are not influenced by political considerations .
5  Today, some analysts ask whether incorporating into bank supervision 
the perceived risks associated with climate change is appropriate, wise, and consistent with our existing mandates . 
Addressing climate change seems likely to require policies that would have 
significant distributional and other effects on companies, industries, regions, and nations.  Decisions about policies to directly address climate change should be made by the ele cted 
branches of government and thus reflect the public’s will  as expressed through elections. 
At the same time, i n my view, t he Fed  does have narrow, but important, 
responsibilities regarding climate -related financial risks.  These responsibilities are 
tightly linked to our responsibilities for bank supervision.
6  The public reasonably 
expects supervisors to require that banks understand, and appropriately manage, their 
material risks , including the financial risks of climate change . 
But without explicit congressional legislation, it would be inappropriate for  us to 
use our monetary policy or supervisory  tools to promote a greener economy or to achieve 
other climate -based goals.7  We are not, and will not be, a “climate policymaker .”  
 
 
5 Like our monetary policy independence,  our independence in this area comes with a high level of 
transparency about our policies and proce dures . 
6 For details, s ee Board of Governors (2022).  
7 While U.S. monetary policy has the dual mandate  of maximum employment and price stability, some 
other central banks have somewhat more expansive mandates.  The Bank of England and the European 
Central Bank both have  a primary mandate to maintain price stability but a secondary mandate to support 
the economic policies of the U.K. government and the European Union, respectively;  see the Bank of 
England Act 1998 , part II(11),  available from the U.K. National Archives at 
https://www.legis lation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/11/contents , and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European 
Union , Article 127(1),  available from the European Union at https://lexparency.org/eu/TFEU/ART_127 .  - 4 -

Thank you for the honor of sharing this award with such a worthy person, my 
friend and former colleague  Ben Bernanke, and also for the honor of being associated 
with the exemplary life and legacy of Paul Douglas.  
Sen. Douglas’ s contributions to ethics in government  are an important aspect of 
that legacy, but since Ben and I are the first economists to win this award, I would also 
like to give due credit to Professor Douglas for his contributions to economics. 
 Working with the  mathematician Charles Cobb, Douglas gathered data and 
created a statistical model that advanced economists’ understanding of the relative 
contributions to production made by capital and labor.  This work demonstrated many of 
the methods that economists would come to use and continue to use to this day.  Douglas 
constructed empirical  measures of key economic concepts .  He  then employed what were, 
for the time, advanced statistical techniques to analyze these data, thereby shedding light 
on a basic economic relationship.  As one recent commentator put it, work such as 
Douglas’s was part of “ a growing literature  , , , [that] played an important role in shaping 
the approach to combining statistical methods and economic theory that would become 
the standard econometric practice in the later decades of the 20th  century.”1 
But, of course, Paul Douglas w as much more than an economist.  From an early 
age, he always seemed to be the man in the middle, see n by the two sides of a dispute as 
intelligent, knowledgeable, and impartial enough to be trusted t o seek a solution.  He 
mediated labor disputes and advised local government officials  in Illinois .  He also 
helped governors in Pennsylvania and New York develop what became Social Security, 
unemployment insurance, and the idea of public ly owned power utilities.   After losing his

first election for the U.S. Senate  in 1942, at the age of 49 he enlisted in the U.S. Marines 
and was awarded a Bronze Star and Purple Heart for his service  in the Pacific.   Later, 
after he was elected to the Senate, Douglas  was a champion of consumer protection laws, 
including the 1968 Truth in Lending Act, and was a leading supporter of c ivil rights 
legislation.  
One of Paul Douglas’ s most important achievements in public life was to promote 
ethics in government.  He was raised with a strong sense of right and wrong and was 
heavily influenced by the philosopher John Stuart Mill to believe that ethical behavior 
was also an eminently practical approach to life.  As a college professor, he entered 
public life in Chicago in the 1920s somewhat reluctantly to fight the spectacular political 
and commercial corruption that w as strangling the city.  Once elected to office, h e faced 
the challenge of how to act ethically when corruption was so universal that the city’ s 
alderme n were expected to funnel large sums to their constituents, based on the 
presumption that all politicians were “ on the take. ”  If he refused bribes and then had no 
money to hand out, how would he  convince people that he wasn’t simply refusing to 
share?   
The key was transpa rency and communication.  Everyone who asked for a large 
payment was handed a mimeographed statement titled “Please Help Me to Be an Honest 
Alderman.” At first , the public, inured to corruption, either disbelieved him or thought 
him a sucker  for refusing to take bribes .  But over time, Douglas’ s stand changed both the 
demands made b y supplicants and his constituents’ expectations for ethical behavior by a 
government official.    - 3 - 
Similar ly, in 1939, Paul Douglas was one of the first public officials  in America 
to publish a full accounting of his personal finances.  In his memoir, Douglas admits that 
this and other ethical rules he imposed on himself were often a nuisance and , in some 
cases , probably went f urther than needed to demonstrate his honesty.  But he believed 
that the public’s trust was so fundamental to the effect iveness of government that such 
steps were appropriate.  As a s enator , he contin ued to publish his finances and observed 
strict limits on the value of personal gifts he received from those seeking benefits from 
him as a public official.  He strongly believ ed that these gift limits  also made him more 
effective as a public servant, and he campaigned for legislation that ultimately led to the 
widespread requirement of financial disclosure and  limits on accepting gifts .  
I share Paul Douglas’s view that behavin g ethically is both the right thing  to do 
and, in practical terms, help s maintain  the trust the public places in those who act on its 
behalf.  T he Federal Reserve’s very effectiveness  in setting monetary policy  depends on 
the public’s assured confidence  that we act only in its interest.  We must act ethically, and 
we must demonstrate our ethical standards in ways that l eave little room for doubt.   
I am grateful to share this award  with Ben , and I am even more grateful for the 
example Paul Douglas set fo r ethics in government that has guided countless public 
officials since his day and also shaped the public’s expectation that its leaders will put the 
public’s interests first.

A Challenging Decade and a Question for the Future  
 
 
 
Remarks by 
 
Janet L. Yellen  
 
Chair  
 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  
 
at the 
 
2017 Herbert Stein Memorial Lecture  
National  Economists Club 
 
Washington, D.C.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
October  20, 2017 
  
I am delighted to address the National Economists Club, and I am also honored on 
this occasion to be associated with Herb Stein, whose public service and 
scholarship --characterized b y careful analysis, clear -eyed pragmatism, and sharp wit --
exemplified the best in our profession.  Herb was willing to consider new ideas and new 
approaches to government policy, and that openness fits with the subject of  my remarks 
today.  Namely, I will discuss the unconventional monetary policy tools used by the 
Federal Reserve since the start of the financial crisis and Great Recession and the role 
that those tools may play in addressing future economic challenges.  
Nearly 10 years ago, with our nation mired in its worst economic and financial 
crisis since the Great Depression, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) 
confronted a key challenge to the pursuit of its congressionally mandated goals of 
maximum employment and price stability:  how to support  a weakening U.S. economy 
once our main conventional policy tool , the federal funds rate , had been lowered to 
essentially zero .  Addressing that problem eventually led to a second challenge:  how to 
ensure that we could scale back monetary policy accommodation in an orderly fashion 
once it was no longer needed.  Failure to meet either challenge w ould have significantly 
compromise d our ability to  foster maximum employment and price stability, leading to 
serious  consequences for the livelihoods of millions of Americans.   
I will argue today that we have met the first challenge and have made good 
progress to date in meeting the second.  Thanks in part to the monetary policy 
accommodation provided in the aftermath of the crisis --especially through enhanced 
forward rate guidance and large -scale asset purchases-- the U.S. economy has made great 
strides.  Indeed, with the economy now operating near maximum employment and  - 2 - 
inflation expected to rise to the FOMC’s 2 percent objective over the next couple of 
years, the FOMC has been scaling back the accommodation provided in response to the 
Great Recession.  In no small part because of our authority to pay interest on excess 
reserves, the process of removing policy accommodation is working well.  
After discu ssing a few issues related to our recent decision to start reducing the 
size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet , I will address a key question:  What is the 
appropriate future role of the unconventional policy tools that we deployed to address the 
Grea t Recession?  While I believe that influencing short -term interest rates  should 
continue to be our primary monetary policy lever in normal times , our unconventional 
policy tools  will likely be needed again  should some future economic downturn drive 
short -term interest rates back to their effective lower bound.  Indeed, empirical analysis 
suggest s that the neutral federal funds rate --defined as the level of the federal funds rate 
that is neither expansionary nor contractionary when the economy is operating near its 
potential --is much lower than in previous decades .  Consequently, the  probability that 
short -term interest rates may need to be reduced to their effective lower bound at some 
point is uncomfortably high, even in the absence of a major financial and economic crisis.    
I will return to the question about the future of our various policy tools, but first I 
would like to review our experience this decade, which I view as instructive for 
addressing that question.    
Meeting the Challenge of Providing Addi tional Accommodation  
A substantial body of  evidence suggests that the U.S. economy is much stronger  
today than it would have been without the unconventional monetary policy tools 
deployed by the Federal Reserve in response to the Great Recession .  Two key tools were  - 3 - 
large -scale asset purchases  and forward guidance  about our intentions for the future path 
of short -term interest rates.  The rationale for those tools was straightforward:  Given our 
inability to meaningfully lower short -term interest rates afte r they reached near -zero in 
late 2008, the FOMC used increasingly explicit forward rate guidance and asset 
purchases to apply downward pressure on longer -term interest rates, which were still well 
above zero.  
Longer -term interest rates reflect, in part, f inancial market participants’ 
expectations of the future path of short -term interest rates.  As a result, FOMC 
communications that affect those expectations --such as the enhanced forward rate 
guidance provided in our post -meeting statements in the aftermat h of the Great 
Recession --can affect longer -term interest rates.1  In addition, longer -term interest rates 
include a term premium, which is the compensation demanded by investors for bearing 
the interest rate risk associated with longer -term securities.  W hen the Federal Reserve 
buys longer -term securities in the open market, the remaining stock of securities available 
for purchase by the public declines, which pushes  the prices of those securities up and 
thus depress es their yields by lowering the term premiums embedded in those yields.2  
Several studies have found that our forward rate guidance and asset purchases did 
appreciably reduce longer -term interest rates.3   
                                                 
1 Before the Great Recession, the FOMC occasionally provided forward rate guidance, but that guidance 
was typically confined to a relatively short horizon.  
2 In addition to depressing term premiums, large -scale asset purchases by the Federal Reserve can low er 
longer -term yields if those purchases are perceived by the public as a signal that short -term interest rates 
are likely to remain lower for longe r than previously anticipated.

Bound on Medium - and Longer -Term Interest Rates,” American Economic Review,  vol. 104 (October),  
pp. 3154 -85; Joseph Gagnon, Matthew Raskin, Julie Remache, and Brian Sack (2011), “The Financial 
Market Effects of the Federal Reserve’s Large -Scale Asset Purchases,” International Journal of Central 
Banking,  vol. 7 (March), pp. 3 -43, www.ijcb.org/journal/ijcb11q1a1.pdf ; and Stefania D’Amico, William  - 4 - 
The FOMC’s goal in lowering longer -term interest rates was to help the U.S. 
economy recover from the recession and stem the disinflationary forces that emerged 
from it.  Some have suggested that the slow pace of the economic recovery proves that 
our unconventional policy tools were ineffective.  However, one should recognize that 
the recovery could have been much slower in the absence of our unconventional tools.  
Indeed, the evidence strongly suggests that forward rate guidance and securities 
purchases --by substantially lowering borrowing costs for millions  of American families 
and businesses and making overall financial conditions more accommodative --did help 
spur consumption and business spending, lower the unemployment rate, and stave off 
disinflationary pressures.4  
Other central banks also deployed unconventional policy tools in the years that 
followed the financial crisis.5  Evidence  accumulated from their experience also supports 
the notion that these tools have helped stimulate economic activity in their countries after 
their short -term interest rates  were lowered to near -zero--and, in some cases, even below 
zero.6

Meeting the Challenge  of Scaling Back Accommodation  
By 2014, the U.S. economy was making notable progress toward the FOMC’s 
goals of maximum employment and price stability.  The unemployment rate had dropped 
to 6 percent by midyear --well below its Great Recession peak of 10 percent --and other 
measures of labor market conditions were also showing significant improvement.  In 
addition, inflation, as measured by the change in the price index fo r personal 
consumption expenditures , had reached about 1- 3/4 percent by mid- 2014 after hovering 
around 1 percent in the fall of 2013.  Reflecting that progress, the Federal Reserve’s 
focus was shifting from providing additional monetary policy accommodation to scaling 
it back.7  A key question for the FOMC then was how to reduce the degree of 
accommodation in the context of a vastly expanded Federal Reserve balance sheet.   
One possible approach was to start by reducing the  Federal Reserve’s securities 
holdings while short -term interest rates remained at the lower bound .  We c ould allow 
securities to roll off the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and even sell securities, thereby 
putting upward pressure on long- term rates while calibrat ing the pace and configuration 
of the reduction in our holdings  as warranted by our maximum employment and price 
stability objectives.  Eventually, once our securities holdings had shrunk sufficiently, the 
FOMC could start nudging up its short -term interest rate target. 
One problem of this “last  in, first out” approach was that the FOMC does not have 
any experience in calibrating the pace and composition of asset redemptions and sales to 
actual and prospective economic conditions.  Indeed, as the so- called taper tantrum of

2013 illustrate d, even talk of prospective changes in our securities holdings c an elicit 
unexpected abrupt changes in financial conditions.   
Given the lack of experience with reducing our asset holdings to scale back 
monetary policy accommodation and the ne ed to carefully calibrate the removal  of 
accommodation, the FOMC  opted to allow changes in the Federal Reserve’s securities 
holdings to play a secondary role in the Committee’s normalization  strategy .  Rather than 
balance sheet shrinkage, the FOMC decided that its primary tool for scaling back 
monetary policy accommodation would be influencing short -term interest rates .   
As we explained in our “normalization principles” issued in September 2014, the 
FOMC decided to maintain the overall size of the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings at 
an elevated level until sometime after the FOMC had begun to raise short -term interest 
rates.8  Once normalization of the level of the federal funds rate was “well under way” 
and the Committee judged that the economic expansion was strong enough that further 
increases in short -term interest rates were likely to be warranted, the FOMC would 
gradual ly and predictabl y reduce the size of the balance sheet by allow ing the Federal 
Reserve’s securities holdings to “run off”--that i s, we would allow our balance sheet to 
shrink passively by not reinvesting all of the principal payments from our securities.9  
                                                 
8 Information on t he FOMC’s Policy Normalization Principles and Plans is available on the Board’s 
website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/policy -normalization.htm . 
9 The FOMC announced in December 2015 that it anticipated maintaining its reinvestment policy until 
normalization of the level of the federal funds rate was “well under way .”  That announcement is available 
on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20151216a1.pdf .  
More recently, in June 2017, the FOMC provided additional details regarding its approach t o reduce the 
Federal Reserve’s securities holdings, indicating that once the balance sheet normalization plan began, 
principal payments received from securities held by the Federal Reserve would be reinvested only to the 
extent that those payments exceeded  certain monthly caps.  The caps would rise gradually but would 
remain in place during the normalization process.  The June 2017 announcement , Addendum to the Policy 
Normalization Principles and Plans,  is available on the Board’s website at 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_PolicyNormalization.20170613.pdf . 
  - 7 - 
One advantage of the FOMC’s chosen approach to scaling back accommodation 
is that b oth the FOMC and the public have decades of experience with adjustments in 
short -term interest rates in response  to changes in economic conditions.   Nonetheless , the 
post-crisis environment presented a new test to the FOMC ’s ability to influence short -
term interest rates . 
Before the crisis, the FOMC could raise the federal funds rate --the rate at which 
banks with excess reserves lend to banks with a reserve need --by removing a small 
amount of reserves from the banking system .  That would translate into a higher federal 
funds rate because reserves were relatively scarce  to begin with.  The intuition was 
simple:  The FOMC would signal that it was going to tighten conditions in the reserve 
market , and the cost of obtaining reserves in the market --the federal funds rate --would 
rise.  Other market interest rates would then increase accordingly.   
After the crisis, however, reserves were plentiful because the Federal Reserve 
funded its large -scale asset purchases through adding reserves to the system --crediting 
the bank accounts of those who were selling asse ts to the Fed.  Moreover, in light of the 
FOMC’s decision not to sell the longer -term securities it acquired, reserves were likely to 
remain plentiful for the foreseeable future.  Consequently, when the time came to remove 
accommodation, a key question for  the Committee was how to raise the federal funds rate 
in an environment of abundant reserves.10  An important part of the answer to that 
question came in the Federal Reserve’s authority to pay interest on excess reserves.  The

decisions, see Jane E. Ihrig, Ellen E. Meade, and Gretchen C. Weinbach (2015), “Rewriting Monetary 
Policy 101:  What’s the Fed’s Preferred Post -Crisis Approach to Raising Interest Rates?” Journal of

Congress granted the Federal Reserve that authority in 2006, to become effective in 2011.  
However, in the fall of 2008, the Congress moved up the effective date to October 2008.   
Having authority to pay interest on excess reserves means that the Federal 
Reserve can  influence the fed eral funds rate and other short -term interest rates  regardless 
of the amount of excess reserves in the banking system .  The mechanics of the new 
framework  are straightforward:  Banks will generally only provide short -term funding at 
an interest rate around  or above what they could earn at the Fed.  As a result, if the 
Federal Reserve raised the rate it paid, other short -term lending rates would likely rise as 
well.11  This new approach for raising short -term interest rates is working well:  Since 
December 20 15, we have raised the interest paid on excess reserves and the target range 
for the federal funds rate by 100 basis points, and the effective federal funds rate has 
risen accordingly .12 
A Closer Look at Our Balance Sheet Strategy  
In light of our recent decision to start reducing our securities holdings this month, 
I would like to discuss a few aspects of our balance sheet strategy.13  The FOMC 
anticipated that its decision to maintain the size of the Federal Reserve’s securities 
                                                 
11 The Federal Reserve created supplementary tools to be used as needed to help strengthen its influence 
over short -term interest rates when reserves are plentiful.  For instance, the overnight reverse repurchase 
agreement facility allows a variety of counterparties, including eligible money market funds, government -
sponsored enterprises, broker -dealers, and depository institutions to invest funds overnight with the Federal 
Reserve at a rate determined by the FOMC.   
12 For a discussion of how increases in the FOMC’s target range for the federal funds rate have transmitted 
to other short -term interest rates, see Alyssa Anderson, Jane Ihrig, Mary -Frances Styczynski, and Gretchen 
C. Weinbach (2017), “How Have the Fed’s Three Rate Hikes Passed through to Selected Short -Term 
Interest Rates?” FEDS Notes (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System , June  2),

13 The FOMC’s announcement of the beginning of implementation of the balance sheet normalization plan 
is available on the Board’s website; see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2017),

holdings at an elevated le vel until sometime after the beginning of rate hikes would keep 
some downward pressure on longer -term interest rates well after the end of its asset 
purchase programs .  Although estimates of the effect of our securities holdings on longer -
term interest rates are subject to uncertainty, a recent study report ed that the Federal 
Reserve’s securities holdings were reducing the term premium on the 10- year Treasury 
yield by roughly 1 percentage point at the end of 2016.14   
The guidance that the FOMC would eventua lly start a gradual and predictable 
reduction of the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings  implied that the downward 
pressure on longer -term yields would likely diminish over time as financial market 
participants came to expect that the start of balance sh eet normalization was nearing.  
Indeed, with that process now under way, it is likely that our securities holdings are now 
depressing the  term premium on the  10-year yield by somewhat less than the 
1 percentage point estimate reported for late last year . 
Several factors suggest that the downward pressure on term premiums exerted by 
our securities holdings is likely to diminish only gradually as our holdings shrink.  F or 
instance, as I have already noted, our intention to reduce our balance sheet by reducing 
reinvest ment of repayments of principal  on our holdings --rather than selling assets-- has 
been well communicated for several years now.  As a result, we do not anticipate a jump 
in term premiums as our balance sheet reduction plan gets under way.  In addition, the 
                                                 
14 See Brian Bonis, Jane Ihrig, and Min Wei (2017), “Projected Evolution of the SOMA Portfolio and the 
10-Year Treasury Term Premium Effect,” FEDS Notes (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System, September 22), https://doi.org/10.17016/2380 -7172.2081.    - 10 - 
maturity distribution of our securities holdings is such that it will take some  years for the 
size of our holdings to normalize via runoff.15   
The judgment that the downward pressure on term premiums will decline only 
gradually as we reduc e the size of our balance sheet stands in sharp contrast to e vidence 
suggesting that this pressure built up rather quickly when we were expanding our balance 
sheet.  To understand this contrast, remember that, unlike our plan to shrink our balance 
sheet, t he various phases of our asset purchases had, to differing degrees, an element of 
surprise, with asset purchase announcements occasionally leaving a distinct imprint on 
the path of longer -term yields.  Moreover, each of our asset purchase programs resulted  
in a rapid increase in our securities holdings during a relatively short period, whereas the 
normalization process will play out gradually over many years.  
I have focused thus far on the likely response of term premiums  to our balance  
sheet reduction plan.  Let me tu rn my attention briefly to the likely response of longer -
term yields , which, as I have noted, reflect both a term premium component and 
expectations of the future path of short -term interest rates.  While the available evidence 
points to a strong reaction of longer -term yields to our asset purchases, it is conceivable 
that those yields will react much more modestly to our balance  sheet reduction plan.   
Consider, for instance, a hypothetical scenario in which the FOMC has decided 
not to rely on balance sheet reduction to scale back accommodation, choosing instead to 
continue to reinvest indefinitely all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s 
                                                 
15 Moreover, as the FOMC announced in June, the Committee decided to cap the monthly run -off in the 
Federal Reserve’s securities holdings, making the balance sh eet normalization process even more 
predictable and gradual.  The FOMC’s announcement is available on the Board’s website; see Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2017), “FOMC Issues Addendum to the Policy Normalization 
Principles and Plans,”  press release, June 14, 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20170614c.htm .  - 11 - 
securities holdings.  If financial market participants perceived no change in the economic 
outlook and no intention on the part of the FOMC to alter the overall  stance of monetary 
policy, the FOMC’s inclination to leave the size of the balance sheet unchanged would be 
taken as an indication that the FOMC would instead rely more on increases in short -term 
interest rates to scale back accommodation, resulting in a faster pace of short -term 
interest hikes.  On net, longer -term yields may be little affected by this hypothetical 
scenario:  While the decreased emphasis on balance sheet reduction would depress term 
premiums and hold longer -term yields lower, the expected faster pace of short -term 
interest rate increases would push longer -term yields higher.16   
A Key Question for the Future  
As the financial crisis and Great Recession fade into the past and the st ance of 
monetary policy gradually returns to normal, a natural question concerns the possible 
future role of the unconventional policy tools we deployed after the onset of the crisis.  
My colleagues on the FOMC and I believe that, whenever possible , influe ncing short -
term interest rate s by targeting the federal funds rate should be our primary tool .  As I 
have already noted, we have a long track record using this tool to pursue our statutory 
goals.  In contrast, we have much more limited experience with using our securities 
holdings for that purpose.   
Where does this assessment leave our unconventi onal policy tools?  I believe their 
deployment should be considered again if our conventional tool reaches its limit --that is , 
                                                 
16 In contrast, when the Federal Reserve was purchasing assets, short- term interest rates were at their 
effective lower bound, and they were expected to remain there for the foreseeable future.  As a result, 
decisions to buy additional assets --and the resulting additional downward pressure on term pr emiums --were 
not offset by expectations of a higher path for short -term interest rates.  The end result was that there was 
greater potential for asset purchases to have a discernible effect on longer -term yields in the years 
immediately following the finan cial crisis than in current circumstances.    - 12 - 
when the federal funds rate has reached its effective lower bound and the U.S. economy 
still needs further monetary policy accomm odation.   
Does this mean that it will take another Great Recession for our unconventional 
tools to be used again?  Not necessarily.  Recent studies suggest that the neutral level of 
the federal funds rate  appears to be much lower than it was in previous d ecades.17  
Indeed, most FOMC participants now assess the longer -run value of the neutral federal 
funds rate as only 2- 3/4 percent or so, compared with around 4- 1/4 percent just a few 
years ago.18  With a low neutral federal funds rate, there will typically b e less scope for 
the FOMC to reduce short -term interest rates in response to an economic downturn, 
raising the possibility that we may need to resort again to enhanced forward rate guidance 
and asset purchases to provide needed accommodation.19   
Of course,  substantial uncertainty surrounds any estimates of the neutral level of 
short -term interest rates.  In this regard, there is an important asymmetry to consider.  If 
the neutral rate turns out to be significantly higher than we currently estimate, it is le ss

likely that we will have to deploy our unconventional tools again.  In contrast, if the 
neutral rate is as low as we estimate or even lower , we will be glad to have our 
unconventional tools in our toolkit . 
The bottom line is that we must recognize that our unconventional  tools might 
have to be used again.  If we are indeed living in a low -neutral -rate world, a significantly 
less severe economic downturn than the Great Recession might be sufficient to drive 
short -term interest rates back to their effectiv e lower bound.   
Conclu sion 
Let me conclude with a brief summary.  As a result of the Great Recession, the 
Federal Reserve has confronted two key challenges over the past several years:   One, t he 
FOMC had to provide additional policy accommodation after short -term interest rates 
reached their effective lower bound ; and two, s ubsequently, as we made progress toward 
the achievement of our mandate, we had to start scaling back that accommodation in the 
presence of a vastly expanded Federal Reserve balance sheet.   
Today I highlighted two points about the FOMC’s experience with those  
challenges.  First, the monetary policy tools that the Federal Reserve deployed in the 
immediate aftermath of the crisis --explicit forward rate guidance, large -scale asset 
purchases, and the payment of interest on excess reserves --have helped us overcome 
these challenges.   
Second, in light of evidence suggesting that the neutral level of short -term interest 
rates is significantly lower than it was in previous decades, the likelihood  that future 
monetary policymakers will have to confront those two challenges again is 
uncomfortably high.  For this reason, we must keep our unconventional policy tools  - 14 - 
ready to be deployed again should short -term interest rates return to their effective lower 
bound. ",2017-10-20,yellen

Responding to High Inflation, with Some Thoughts on a Soft Landing  
   
Remarks by

Institute for Monetary and Financial Stability Distinguished Lecture   
Goethe University  
     
Frankfurt , Germany  
          
May 30, 2022 
  
Thank you, Professor Wieland,  for the introduction, and thank you to the Institute 
for Monetary and Financial Stability for the opportunity to speak to you today.1  I come 
here at a moment of great challenge for Germany and Europe, and a moment in which it 
has never been more evident  that the interests of Europe and the United States are closely 
aligned.  America stands with Europe in defending Ukraine  because we all understand 
that an assault on democracy in Europe is a threat to democracy everywhere.  We also face the common challen ge of excessive inflation , which is no coincidence, since 
Germany and other countries are dealing with many of the same forces driving up 
inflation in the United States.    
Fortunately, in response to this moment of common challenges and interests, 
Europe and the United States have strengthened our ties and I believe we are more 
unified today than we have been for decades.  We see that in the deepening and possible 
broadening of our security commitments, and we also see it in the strong commitment 
that cent ral banks in Europe and elsewhere have made to fight inflation.   
In today’s distinguished lecture I will deal with two distinct topics, both of which 
I believe will be of interest.  First, I will provide my outlook for the U.S. economy and 
how the Federal  Reserve plans to reduce inflation and achieve our 2 percent target.  Then 
I will pivot to a more academic discussion of the labor market and the possibility of a soft 
landing in which taming inflation does not harm employment.  
  Let me start with  the economic outlook for the United States.  Despite a pause 
early this year  in the growth of real gross domestic product  (GDP) , the U.S. economy 
 
1 I am grateful to Andrew Figura  for assistance in preparing the  Beveridge curve material .  These remarks 
represent my own views  and not any position of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market 
Committee.   - 2 - 
continues to power along at a healthy pace.  The contraction in output reported in the first 
quarter was due to swings in two volatile categories, inventories and net exports , and I 
don’t expect them  to be repeated .  Consumer spending and business investment, which 
are the bedrock of GDP, were both strong, and more recent data point toward solid 
demand and continuing momentum in the economy that will sustain output growth in the 
months ahead. 
Another sign of strength is the labor market, which has created 2 million jobs in 
the first four months of 2022 at a remarkably steady pace that is down only slightly from 
the 562,000 a month last year.  Unemployment is near a 50 -year low, and both the low 
numbers of people filing for unemployment benefits and the high number of job openings indicate that the slowdown in the economy from the fast pace of last year isn’t yet weighing on the job market.  Some look at labor force participation, which is below its 
pre-COVID- 19 level , as leaving a lot of room for improvement.  H owever, there are 
underlying factors that explain why participation  is depressed, including early retireme nts 
and individual choices associated with COVID concerns.  Whatever the cause, low participation has contributed to the fact that there are two job vacancies for every one 
person counted looking for a job, a record high.  Before the pandemic, when the labor market was in very solid shape, there was one vacancy for every two unemployed people.  As I will explain, this very tight labor market ha s implications for inflation and the Fed’s 
plans for reducing inflation.  But on its own terms, we need to recognize  that robust job 
creation  is an underlying strength of the U.S. economy, which is expanding  its productive 
capacity and supporting personal income  and ongoing economic growth , in the face of 
other challenges.   - 3 - 
Let me turn now to the outlook for the Fed’s top priority, inflation.  I said in 
December that inflation was alarmingly high , and it has remained so .  The April 
consumer price index (CPI)  was up  8.3 percent  year over year .  This headline number 
was a slight decline from 8.5 percent in March but primarily due to a drop in volatile 
gasoline prices that we know surged again this month .  Twelve -month “ core” inflation, 
which strips out volatile  food and energy prices, was also down slightly to 6.2 percent in 
April, from 6.5 percent the month before, but the 0.6 percent monthly increase from 
March was an acceleration from the February to March rate and still too high .  
Meanwhile, t he Fed’s prefer red measure based on personal consumption expenditures 
(PCE) recorded headline inflation of 6.3 percent  and core of 4.9 percent .  These lower 
readings relative to CPI reflect differences in the weights of various categories across 
these indexes.  No matter which measure is considered, however, headline inflation has 
come in above 4 percent  for about a year  and core inflation is not coming down enough 
to meet the Fed’s  target anytime soon .  Inflation this high  affects everyone but is 
especially painful for lower-  and middle -income households that spend a large share of 
their income on shelter, groceries, gasoline, and other necessities .  It is the FOMC’s job 
to meet our  price stability mand ate and get inflation down, and we are determined to do 
so.  
The forces driv ing inflation today are the same ones that emerged a year ago.   The 
combination of strong consumer demand and supply constraints —both bottlenecks and a 
shortage of workers relative  to labor demand—is  generating very high inflation.  We can 
argue about whether supply or demand is a greater factor, but the details have no bearing 
on the fact that we are not meeting the FOMC’s price stability mandate.  What I care  - 4 - 
about is getting inflation down so that we avoid a lasting escalation in the public’s 
expectations of future inflation.  Once inflation expectations become unanchored in this 
way, it is very difficult and economically painful to lower them.  
While it is not surprising that inflation expectations for the next year are up, since 
current  inflation is high, what I focus on is longer -term inflation expectations.  Recent 
data that tr y to measure longer -term expectations are mixed.  Overall, my assessment is 
that longer -range  inflation expectations have moved up from a level that was consistent 
with trend inflation below 2 percent to a level that’s consistent with underlying inflation a little above 2 percent .  I will be watching that these expectati ons do not continue to rise 
because l onger -term inflation expectations influence  near term inflation , as well as our 
ability to achieve our 2 percent target.  W hen they are anchored, they influence spending 
decisions today in a way that help s inflation mov e toward our target.  T o ensure th ese 
longer -term expectations do not move up broadly, t he Federal Reserve has tools to reduce 
demand, which should eas e inflation pressures .  And, over time, supply constraints will 
resolve to help rein in price increases as well , although we don’t know how soon.   
I cannot emphasize enough that m y FOMC colleagues and I  are united in our 
commitment to do what it takes to bring inflation down and achieve the Fed’s 2 percent 
target.   Since the start of this year , the FOMC has raised the target range for the federal 
funds rate by 75 basis points , with 50 basis points of that increase coming at our meeting 
earlier this month .  We also issued forward guidance about the likely path of poli cy.  The 
May FOMC statement said the Committee “anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate.”    - 5 - 
 I support tightening policy by another 50 basis points for several  meetings.  In 
particular, I am not taking 50 basis -point hike s off the table until I see inflation coming 
down closer to our 2 percent target.  And, by the end of this year , I support having the 
policy rate at a level above neutral so that it is reducing demand for products and labor , 
bringing it more in line with supply and thus help ing rein in inflation .  This is my 
projection today, given where we stand and how I expect the economy to evolve.  Of 
course, my future decisions will depend on incoming data.  In the next couple of weeks, 
for example, the May empl oyment and CPI reports will be released.  Those are two key 
pieces of data  I will be watching to get information about the continuing strength of the 
labor market and about the momentum in price increases.  O ver a longer period , we will 
learn more about how monetary policy i s affecting demand and how supply constraints 
are evolv ing.  If the data suggest that inflation is stubbornly high , I am prepared to do 
more.     
My plan for rate hikes is roughly in line with the expectations of financial 
markets .  As seen in slide  1, federal funds futures are pricing in roughly 50 basis point 
hikes at the FOMC’s next two meetings and expect ing the year -end policy rate to be 
around 2.65 percent.  So, in total, markets expect about 2.5 percent age points  of 
tighteni ng this year .  This expectation represents a significant degree of policy tightening, 
consistent with the  FOMC’s  commitment to get inflation back under control  and, if we 
need to do more, we will . 
These current  and anticipated policy actions have  already r esulted in a significant 
tightening of financial conditions.  The benchmark 10- year Treasury security began the 
year at a yield of around 1.5 percent and has risen to around 2.8 percent .  Rates for home  - 6 - 
mortgages  are up 200 basis points, and other credit  financing costs  have followed suit.  
Higher rates make it more expensive to finance spending and investment  which  should 
help reduce demand and contribute to lower inflation.   
In addition to raising rates, t he FOMC further tightened monetary policy by 
ending asset purchases in March and then agreeing to start reducing our holdings of 
securities, a process that begins  June 1.  By allowing securities to mature without 
reinvesting them , the Fed’s balance sheet will shrink .  We will phase in the amount o f 
redemptions over three months.  By September , we anticipate having up to $95 billion of 
securities rolling off the Fed’s  portfolio each month.  This pace will reduce the Fed’s 
securities holdings by about $1 trillion over the next year , and the reductions will 
continue until securities holdings are deemed close to the ample levels needed to implement policy efficiently and effectively. Although estimates are highly uncertain, using a variety of models and assumptions, the overall reduction in the balance sheet is 
estimated to be equivalent to a couple of  25-basis -point rate hikes. 
All these  actions have the goal of bringing inflation down toward the FOMC’s  2 
percent target.  Increased rates and a smaller balance sheet raise the cost of borrowing and thus r educe household and business demand.  On top of this , I also hope that over 
time supply problems resolve and help lower inflation.  But the Fed isn’t waiting for 
these supply constraints to resolve .  We have the tools and the will to make substantial 
progress toward our target.   
The United States is not alone in facing excessive inflation , and other central 
banks also are responding.  There is a global shift toward monetary tightening .  In the 
euro area, headline i nflation con tinued to edge up in April, to 7.5 percent , while its  - 7 - 
version of core inflation increased from 2.9 percent to 3.5 percent.  Based on t his 
broadening of price pressures , communication by  the European Central Bank (ECB) is 
widely interpreted as signal ing that it will likely start raising  its policy rate this summer 
and that it could raise rates a few times  before year -end.  Policy tightening started  last 
year, as emerging markets including Mexico and Brazil increased rates substantially amid 
expectations of  accelerating inflation.  Several advanced -economy central banks, 
including the Bank of England, began raising interest rates in the second half of last year.  
Like the Fed, the Bank of Canada lifted off in March and, also like the Fed , picked up the 
pace of tightening with a rate hike of 50 basis points at its most recent meeting.  C entral 
banks in Australia and Sweden pivoted sharply to hike rates at their most  recent meetings 
after previously saying that such moves were not likely anytime soon.   
Slide 2 shows the similarly timed policy response s across advanced and emerging 
economy central banks in terms of actual and anticipated increases in their policy rate s.  
Emerging market economies started the year with a policy rate that averaged around 3.5 percent , and they are  expected to end the year averaging a bit over 5 percent.  Advanced 
foreign econ omies started a bit below zero and a t this point are expected to  move up, on 
average, by around 1 percentage point.  This worldwide  increase in policy rates, 
unfortunately, ref lects the fact that high inflation is a global problem , which central banks 
around the world recognize must be addressed .  
Finally, like the Fe d, many other advanced -economy central banks that expanded 
their balance sheets over the past two years are now reversing course.  In recent months, as shown in slide 3, the Bank of Canada and Bank of England have begun to shrink their 
balance sheets by stopping full reinvestment of maturing assets, similar to what the Fed  - 8 - 
will commence in June.  Although the ECB has committed to reinvesting maturing assets 
for quite some time, it has tapered net purchases substantially since last year and has 
indicated it will likely end those purchases early in the third quarter.  
Some have expressed concern that the Fed cannot raise interest rates to arrest 
inflation while also avoiding a  sharp slowdown in economic growth and significant 
damage to the labor market.  One argument in this regard warns that policy tightening will reduce the current high level of job vacancies and push up unemployment substantially, based on the historical rel ationship between these two pieces of data, which 
is depicted by something called the Beveridge curve.  Because  I am now among fellow 
students of economics, I wanted to take a moment to show why this statement may not be correct in current circumstances.  
First, a little background.  The relationship between vacancies and the 
unemployment rate is shown in slide 4.  The blue dots in the figure show observations of 
the vacancy rate and the unemployment rate between  2000 and 2018.  The black curve is 
the fitte d relationship between the log of vacancies and the log of unemployment over 
this period.  It has a somewhat flat, downward slope .  From this, the argument goes, 
policy to slow demand and push down vacancies requires moving along this curve and 
increasing the unemployment rate substantially.   
But there’s another perspective about what a reduction in vacancies implies for 
unemployment that is just as plausible , if not more so .  Slide 5 shows the same 
observations as slide  4 but also adds observations from t he pandemic.  The two larger red 
dots show the most recent observation, March 2022, and January 2019, when the vacancy rate had achieved its highest rate before  the pandemic.  These two dots suggest that  the  - 9 - 
vacancy rat e can be reduced substantially, from the current level to the January 2019 
level, while still leaving the level of vacancies consistent with a strong labor market and 
with a low level of unemployment, such as we had in 2019.  To see why this is a 
plausible outcome, I first need to digress a bit to discuss the important determinants of unemployment.   
Many factors influence the unemployment rate, and vacancies are just one.  Thus, 
to understand how a lower vacancy rate would inf luence unemployment going forward, 
we need to separate the direct effect of vacancies on the unemployment rate from other factors.  To do that, we first need to review the factors that account for  unemployment 
movements.   
There are two broad determinants of unemployment:  separations from 
employment (including layoffs and quits), which raise unemployment , and job finding by 
the unemployed, which lowers unemployment.
2  Separations consist largely of layoffs, 
which are typically cyclical, surging in recessi ons and falling during booms.  Job finding 
is also highly cyclical, rising as the labor market tightens and falling in recessions.   
To see how separations and job finding affect the unemployment rate, it’s helpful 
to start with equation (1) on slide 6, wh ich states that in a steady state (that is , when the 
unemployment rate is constant), flows into unemployment, the left side of equation (1), must equal flows out of unemployment, the right side.  Flows into unemployment equal 
the separation s rate, 𝑠𝑠, time s the level of employment.  For simplicity, I’ve normalized 
the labor force to 1, so that employment equals 1 minus unemployment, 𝑈𝑈.  Flows out of 
unemployment , the right side of the equation, equal the rate of job finding, 𝑓𝑓 , times the 
 
2 For simplicity , I am ignoring flows into and out of the labor force, which can also influence the 
unemployment rate ; see Elsby, Hobijn and Sahin (2015).    - 10 - 
number of unemployed.  Rearranging this equation yields an expression for the steady-
state unemployment rate, equation (2).3  Because flows into and out of unemployment are 
quite high, the actual unemployment rate converges to the steady- state unemployment 
rate quickly, a nd the steady- state unemployment rate typically tracks the actual rate 
closely.4  So, going forward, I’m going to think of the steady- state unemployment rate as 
a good approximation of the actual unemployment rate. 
Now let me focus on job finding, which is often thought to depend on the number 
of job vacancies relative to the number of unemployed workers.  To see why, start with equation (3) on slide 7, which states that the number of hires is an increasing function of 
both the number of job vacancies and the number of unemployed individuals searching for jobs:  The more firms there are looking for workers and the more workers there are looking for jobs, the more matches, or hires, there will be.  For convenience, I’m assuming a mathematical representation of this matching function takes a Cobb-Douglas 
form.  If we divide both sides of equation (3) by unemployment, we get equation (4), which expresses the job -finding rate as a function of the ratio of vacancies to 
unemployment, or labor market tightness.   
Because we have data for both the left and right sides of equation (4), we can 
estimate it and obtain parameter values for the elasticity of job finding with respect to labor market tightness, sigma, and matching efficiency, mu.
5  Matching efficiency 
repre sents factors that can increase (or decrease) job findings without changes in labor 
 
3 If the labor  force is allowed to vary, then the expression is similar but somewhat more complicated.   
4 For more on decomposing unemployment rate movements, see Shimer (2012) ; Elsby, Michaels and Solon 
(2009) ; Fujita and Ramey (20 09); and Ahn  and Crane (2020).  
5 I will assume levels of 𝜇𝜇  and 𝜎𝜎 that are consistent with regressions of 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙�ℎ

unemployment, JOLTS job openings, and transitions from unemployment into employment from 2009 to

market tightness.  On the one hand, i f the workers searching for jobs are well suited for 
the jobs that are available, matching efficiency will be high; on the other hand, if many 
searching workers are not well suited for the available jobs, matching efficiency will be low.
6     
The last step is to plug our expression for job finding into equation (2), the steady -
state unemployment rate, yielding equation (5).  Equation (5)  shows how vacancies affect 
the unemployment rate.  To illustrate this relationship, I solve equation (5) for different 
values of 𝑉𝑉 and 𝑠𝑠 , holding the matching efficiency parameters constant .  That is, I pick  a 
separation rate at some level and trace out  what happens to the unemployment rate as the 
vacancy rate changes.  Then I pick a different separation rate and again trace out the 
effect of vacancies on unemployment.  The result is shown on slide 8, which plots four 
curves showing the effect of vacanci es on unemployment for four different separation 
rates.  Each curve is convex; as the number of vacancies increases relative to the number 
of individuals looking for work, it becomes harder for firms to fill jobs with suitable 
workers, and more jobs remain  vacant.  This is exactly the situation many employers are 
now experiencing.  Because more vacancies generate fewer and fewer hires, they result in 
smaller and smaller reductions in unemployment.  But large numbers of vacancies are, of 
course, a hallmark o f tight labor markets and  additional vacancies continue to strongly 
boost wage growth and quits.  
The curve farthest to the right, labeled s=2.5, represents a situation when the 
separations rate is 2.5 percent, a historically high level.  This rate is appro ximately the 
level seen in the middle of 2020, just after the onset of the pandemic.  You can see that 
 
6 For more on the effect of matching efficiency on unemployment and the Beveridge curve, see Barnichon 
and Figura (2015) ; Elsby, Michaels, and Ratner (2015) ; and Ahn and Hamilton (2020).   - 12 - 
when the separations rate is this high, the unemployment rate is also going to be high, no 
matter the level of vacancies.   
Now let’s think about what ha ppens as the economy recovers, as it has over the 
past two years.  In an expansion, layoffs fall, pushing down separations and moving the curve to the left.  At the same time, greater labor demand increases vacancies, causing the labor market to move up the steep curves.  The combination of these movements is 
shown in slide 9 as the black fitted curve, which I’ve reproduced from slide 4.  As you recall, the black curve fits the actual observations on unemployment and vacancies we saw before  the pandemic.  And we now can see that these observations are produced by a 
combination of changes in vacancies and separations (as well as other influences on 
unemployment).  Decreases in the separations rate reduce the unemployment rate without changing vacancies, imparting a flatness to the fitted curve relative to the steeper curves that only reflec t the effect of vacancies.  If we want to just focus on the effect of 
vacancies, then we should be looking at the steep curves, especially when the labor market is tight, as it is now.     
What does all this suggest about what will happen to the labor mark et when, as I 
expect, a tightening of financial conditions and fading fiscal stimulus start to cool labor demand?  Slide 10 focuses on the Beveridge curve (the relationship produced by the direct effect of changes in vacancies on unemployment) when the sep arations rate is low, 
as it is now.
7  The March 2022 observation lies at the top of the curve and is labeled point 
A.  If there is cooling in aggregate demand spurred by monetary policy tightening that tempers labor demand, then vacancies should fall substantially.  Suppose they decrease 
 
7 Specifically, I set the separation s rate equal to 1.23 percent, a little above current levels.    - 13 - 
from the current level of 7 percent to 4.6 percent, the rate prevailing in January 2019, 
when the labor market was still quite strong.  Then we should travel down the curve from 
point A to point B.8  The unemployment rate will increase, but only somewhat bec ause 
labor demand is still strong —just not as strong— and because when the labor market is 
very tight, as it is now, vacancies generate relatively few hires.  Indeed, hires per vacancy are currently at historically low levels.  Thus, reducing vacancies from  an extremely high 
level to a lower (but still strong) level has a relatively limited effect on hiring and on 
unemployment.   
Now, I also show the January 2019 observation of vacancies and unemployment.  
Recall, this is also where the economy was over the year prior to the pandemic .  As you 
can see, moving from the March 2022 observation to the January 2019 observation is not that different from the change in the unemployment rate predicted by my estimated Beveridge curve , which suggests the predicted small  increase in unemployment is a 
plausible outcome to policy tightening.  
If labor demand cools, will separations increase and shift the curve outward, 
increasing unemployment further?  I don’t think so.  As shown on slide 11 , outside of 
recessions, layoffs don’t change much.  Instead, changes in labor demand appear to be reflected primarily in changes in vacancies.   
Now, it’s certainly possible, even probable, that influences on the unemployment 
rate other than vacancies will change going forward.  In terms  of the equations we have 
been discussing, l ayoffs could increase somewhat, instead of staying constant.  Matching 
efficiency could also improve or deteriorate.  The vacancy rate could also change more or

less than I have assumed.  Thus, I’m not arguing that the unemployment rate will end up 
exactly as the Beveridge curve I’ve drawn suggests.  But I do think it quite plausible that the unemployment rate will end up in the vicinity of what the Beveridge curve currently predicts.   
Another consideration is that non -linear dynamics could take hold if the 
unemployment rate increases by a certain amount, as suggested by the Sahm rule, which holds that recessions have in the past occurred whenever the three- month moving average 
of the unemployment rate rises 0.5 p ercentage point over its minimum rate over the 
previous 12 months.
9  We certainly need to be alert to this possibility, but the past is not 
always prescriptive of the future.  T he current situation is unique.  We’ve never seen a 
vacancy rate of 7 percent before.  Reducing the vacancy rate by 2.5 percentage points would still leave it at a level seen at the end of the last expansion, whereas in previous expansions a reduction of 2.5 percent would have left vacancies at or below 2 percent, a 
level only seen in extremely weak labor markets.  
To sum up, the relationship between vacancies and unemployment gives me 
reason to hope that policy tightening in current circumstances can tame inflation without 
causing a sharp increase in unemployment.  Of course, the path of the economy depends on many factors, including how the Ukraine war and COVID -19 evolve .  From this 
discussion, I am left optimistic that the strong labor market can handle higher rates without a significant increase in unemployment.  
In closing, I want to again thank the institute  for the invitation to address you 
today, at a time of considerable challenge for Germany and the United States.  It’s not the

first time we have faced such moments together.  Just south of the Frankfurt Airport is a 
surprising sight —a couple of antique military cargo planes, parked on the side of the 
Autobahn.  They were built by Douglas Aircraft, nearly 80 years ago, and stand today as monuments to one of the greatest achievements of cooperation between the freedom -
loving people of Europe and those of the United States.   
For 11 months, these two planes, and many others, took off and landed in 
perpetual motion, delivering 2.3 million tons of food, fuel , and other essentials to the 
people of Berlin, who were surrounded and besieged by Soviet forces.  The commitment and ultimate triumph of this improbable airlift was in many ways the beginning of an alliance that has included ongoing economic cooperation that has strengthened both our democracies.  In that spirit, I am c ertain we can both overcome the economic challenges 
that lie ahead.

Thank you, Raj , and thank you to the c oalition for the invitation to be with you—
virtually, at least.   I don’t want to take up too much of the time for our discussion but let 
me frame a few of the issu es around inflation and the economic outlook.1   
Last month we received  a barrage of data that has challeng ed my view in January 
that the Federal Open Market  Committee (FOMC) was making significant progress in 
moderat ing economic activity and reduc ing inflation.  I’m not the only one whose 
outlook has shifted.  Since the end of January, f inancial market  participant s have revised 
their outlooks  in a way that has led them to  mark up their  expectations for the federal 
funds rate at the end of 2023 by about a half percentage point.  
The shift in the data s tarted with a bang  on February 1, with a big  increase i n the 
number of job openings in December that reversed the gradual easing over  several 
months in what is a key indicator of tightness in the labor market.  Part of the FOMC’s 
plan to lower inflation is r educing this  excess tightness , which has been driving elevated 
wage growth  and contributing to high inflation.  T he Job O penings and L abor T urnover 
Survey data can be noisy so, at times, there is a tendency to downplay large moves .  But 
then on February 3, the job report for January show ed a stunning 517,000 increase in 
employment  and the unemployment r ate moved down to a level not seen in over 50 
years .2  These data indicated  that, instead of loosening, the labor market was tightening.3  
A little over a week later, o n Valentine’s Day , instead of a box of chocolates, we got the

unusually warm  weather; however, estimates of weather -adjusted employment a re also quite large.  See

https://www.frbsf.org/economic -research/indicators -data/weather -adjusted -employment -change.

consumer price i ndex ( CPI) inflation report for January and revisions to 2022.  By this 
measure,  not only had inflation stopped declining in January, it also slowed a lot less in 
the second half o f last year than previously reported.4  Later that week , data on producer 
prices  and last week ’s report on personal consumption expenditures  (PCE) prices 
reinforced these two points .  Retail sales for January also came in much stronger than 
expected , sugg esting t he economy was slowing less than it had appeared just a month 
earlier , a picture that was confirmed by data on personal spending, which represents 
almost 70 percent of gross domestic product.  Continuing progress on inflation depends 
on lowering demand and moderating economic activity, and the  retail sales and spending 
data suggest that progress on reducing aggregate demand may have stalled . 
Whether or not subsequent data confirm the setback  in progress last month, the 
FOMC  will do what i s needed to reduce inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective 
over time .  It is possible there may be some  bumps on that path, but I assure you, the 
FOMC’s dual mandate objectives will be achieved .  Inflation has been elevated for  nearly 
two years due to an excess of aggregate demand relative to supply.  Even though the fiscal stimulus and goods supply constraints that contributed to that imbalance have mostly unwound and the FOMC has rapidly raised the target range for the federal funds 
rate, the lab or market remains very tight and aggregate demand has proved resilient to 
considerable increases in interest rates.  One implication of the strong labor market is that 
the FOMC’s maximum employment goal has been achieved and monetary policy can be 
utterly focused on fighting inflation.  Any fear that we might face  two-sided risk in 
achieving our dual mandate was blown away by the January employment numbers.  But

adjustment factors. This adjustment result ed in noticeable  revisions to 2022 seasonally adjusted CPI prices .    - 3 - 
 
an excessively tight labor market complicates the path toward achieving price stability , 
because wages are growing faster than they have in decades, at a pace that may contribut e 
to keeping inflation elevated.  We see this excess pressure in the fast growth of services 
prices, where labor costs are a higher share of overall input costs and shortages of workers are reportedly most acute.  
Although inflation  has been coming down since the middle of last year, the recent 
data indicate that we h aven’t made as much progress as we thought .  That assessment 
goes for both overall inflation, and “core” inflation, which strips out volatile energy and food prices and is a good guide to future price increases .  And this holds for both CPI and 
PCE measures of inflation .  Core CPI inflation over  the last three months of 2022 was 
revised up from 3.1 percent ( at an annual rate) to now be 4.3 percent .  Similarly , the 2022 
fourth quarter  PCE inflation data was revised from 2.9 percent to 3.6 percent.  And  the 
three- month rate s increased  in January ; even measures that trim out the largest and 
smallest price changes saw increases .  These data underscore the view , as laid out in the 
FOMC’s  December Summary of Economic Projections, that the fight to bring inflation 
down to our 2 percent  target will be slower and longer than many had expected just a 
month or two ago. 
I don’t want to brush aside the fact that we have made progress in reducing 
inflation , and there are indications that  further improvement  is coming.  T he three -month 
inflation  rate is running below the  12-month rate, which highlights the progress.  And 
there are reasons to be optimistic about continued improvement, including a sha rp 
deceleration in rent increases  since the middle of last year , which will start to get 
captured in inflation statistics only in the coming months.  - 4 - 
 
But recent data suggest that consumer spending isn’t slowing that much, that the 
labor market continues  to run unsustainably hot, and that inflation is not coming down as 
fast as I had thought .  It could be that progress has stalled, or i t is possible that the 
numbers released last month were a blip , perhaps associated with unusually favorable 
weather, and that forthcoming data will show that economic activity and inflation 
resumed their decline.   
Fortunately, we will get the next employment report and CPI release ahead of the 
March 21–22 FOMC meeting , information that will affect my assessment of the 
appropriate next step for monetary policy.  If job creation drops back down to a level  
consistent with the downward trajectory seen late last year and CPI inflation pulls back 
significant ly from the Janua ry numbers and resumes  its downward path, then I would 
endorse  raising the target range for the federal funds rate a couple more times , to a  
projected terminal rate between 5.1 and 5.4 percent .5  On the other hand, if those data 
reports continue to come in too hot, the policy target range will have to be raised this year even more to ensure that we do not lose the momentum that was in place before the data 
for January were release d.  
I would be ver y pleased if the data we receive on inflation and the labor market 
this month  show signs of moderation, which would suggest that the February data 
releases were just a bump in the road and that progress is continuing.  But wishful thinking is not a substit ute for hard evidence, in the form of economic data.  After seeing 
promising signs of progress, we cannot risk a revival of inflation.  P olicymakers must 
remain data dependent, so my view will depend on what the data say.  
 
5 This estimate of the terminal rate would align with the central tendency of FOMC participants’ 
projections  of the federal funds rate at the end of 2023.  ",2023-03-02,waller

This paper reviews Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) communications 
from the time the Committee began issuing regular postmeeting statements in 1999 to the 
present.1  The authors provide an extended and insightful discussion of the theory and 
practice o f providing forward guidance about monetary policy.  They offer one central 
lesson:  Data -based forward guidance is mostly good, while time -based forward guidance 
is mostly bad.   
The authors  show that data -based guidance has desirable characteristics and can 
make monetary policy more effective.  When clearly articulated and well understood, it allows markets to react appropriately to incoming data, doing the heavy lifting for the 
central bank.   
Time -based guidance is found to have certain bad characterist ics and should be 
avoided, except at the zero lower bound and when other options are not available or not 
working.  Time -based guidance may reduce the sensitivity of rates to incoming 
macroeconomic data, suppress volatility, encourage risk -taking and incre ased leverage, 
and threaten financial stability.  It may also put policymakers in a box when changes in the economy make it optimal to deviate from previously expressed guidance, but the Committee cannot do so without losing credibility.   
The authors blam e time -based guidance for several episodes in which the 
Committee zigged when the market looked for it to zag, leaving market participants unhappy and, in the authors’ view, the FOMC’s credibility damaged.  They argue that the

Committee has relied too much  on time -based guidance in recent years and should use it 
only parsimoniously in the future.  
I commend the authors for undertaking this enormously challenging and useful 
exercise.  The paper forces us to reconsider the Committee’s evolving understanding of  
the macroeconomic environment before, during, and after the Great Recession; its 
decisions and its communications; and the market’s understanding of those decisions, 
which have sometimes deviated from what the Committee actually said.  
The distinction betw een time -based and data -based guidance is an important one, 
and the potential problems with time -based guidance are real and well described in the 
paper.  That said, I am not convinced that this distinction has played a central role in 
determining the successes and challenges of FOMC communications in this remarkable 
era, or that it helps us improve in the future.  The authors are, in their words, 
“unabashedly judgmental” in labeling specific communications to be either time - or data -
based.2  My own judgments differ in significant respects from those described in the 
paper.  
Discussion of Forward Guidance  
I will start in December 2008, when the Committee said that “weak economic 
conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds ra te for 
some time.”3  This relatively weak time -based guidance was strengthened in a series of 
steps until August 2011, when the time -based language became “at least through mid -

2013.”4  The calendar reference was later extended in a couple of steps to “at least 
through mid -2015. ”5  This guidance was explicitly time -based, and the authors seem to 
agree that, through this point, the guidance served its intended purpose at the zero lower 
bound by pushing down medium - and longer -term rates.6 
At the December 201 2 meeting, the Committee ended this calendar -based 
guidance.  The Committee instead adopted thresholds, saying that it did not intend to raise rates at least as long as unemployment remained above 6 ½ percent, inflation one to 
two years ahead was projected to be no higher than 2 ½ percent, and longer -term inflation 
expectations remained well anchored.
7  The adoption of thresholds was a clear change to 
data-based guidance, as its principal sponsors had frequently urged.8  The point was not

6 Some viewed this guidance as merely a forecast of Committee a ction, designed to better inform the 
market and reduce uncertainty.  Others have argued that such guidance is understood as a promise to which 
the Committee will be held irrespective of future macroeconomic developments.  The Committee never 
offered a sing le explanation, and participants may have had different views.  Engen, Laubach, and 
Reifschneider (2015) argue that the Federal Reserve’s time -based guidance initiated in August 2011 was 
highly effective in inducing market participants to change their beli efs about the Committee’s reaction 
function and to regard  monetary policy  as more accommodative.  Using Blue Chip survey data, the authors 
estimate that the perceived weight on resource slack roughly doubled between March 2011 and March 
2012.  In an August  2011 speech, Chairman Bernanke indicated that the guidance about the federal funds 
rate path was highly conditional on the outlook, saying, “in what the Committee judges to be the most 
likely scenarios for resource utilization and inflation in the medium term, the target for the federal funds rate would be held at its current low levels for at least two more years.”  ( Ben S. Bernanke (2011), “The 
Near - and Longer -Term Prospects for the U.S. Economy,” a speech delivered at “Achieving Maximum 
Long -Run Growth ,” a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson

to provide additiona l stimulus at the time of adoption, but rather to allow market 
participants to adjust their expectations about future monetary policy in response to 
incoming data --exactly what the authors advocate.9 
The Committee also used balance sheet policy through most of this period.  The 
first two programs of large -scale asset purchases (LSAPs), popularly known as QE1 and 
QE2, and the maturity extension program were announced in terms of time and quantity--
that is, a certain quantity of assets would be purchased over a certain time.  In adopting 
QE3, by contrast, the Committee committed to continuing purchases until there was a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.
10  QE3 was fully data -
contingent.  
Former Chairman Bernanke recounts in his recent book that he saw QE3 as akin 
to Mario Draghi’s statement that the European Central Bank would do “whatever it 
takes.”11  He also notes that FOMC participants held divergent views on the potential 
costs  and benefits of the program.  Minutes of the relevant meetings described the 
complex discussions and differing views.  Contemporaneous reports by Wall Street analysts show frustration and confusion about the Committee’s intentions.  
When various FOMC commu nications suggested that the time to begin reduc ing 
purchases was nearing, long -term rates rose sharply --the so -called taper tantrum.  The 
                                                   
9 The thresholds ’ useful life was fairly short because the unemployment rate fell sharply,  from 8.0  percent  
in December 2012 to 6.2 percent  in April 2014, while inflation remained below 2.0 percent .   
10 The December 2012 FOMC statement indicated that, “If the outlook for the labor market does not 
improve substantially, the Committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage -backed 
securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropr iate, until such improvement is achieved in a context 
of price stability.  In determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, the Committee will, 
as always, take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.”  (Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2012), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,” press release, December 12,  paragraph 4, www.federalreserve.gov/newseve nts/press/monetary/20121212a.htm .)

W.W. Norton), p. 532.  - 5 - 
contention of this paper is that time -based guidance was responsible.  But as the paper 
acknowledges, the open-ended,  data-contingent nature of the QE3 program created a 
strong sense that the Fed was “all in” and that the purchases might go on for a long time.  
That powerful commitment “would set things up for some fireworks” when the time 
came to provide more precise gu idance as to the timing of tapering, whether that was 
done through time - or data -based guidance.12  While Committee communications are 
subject to fair criticism, I don’t see an important role in this narrative for time -based 
guidance.  
Let’s turn briefly to 2015 and the run- up to last December’s increase in the federal 
funds rate --also an important focus of the paper.  The authors and many market 
participants are critical of communication around the September meeting.  With the June 
2015 Summary of Economic P rojections (SEP) showing that 15 of 17 FOMC participants 
judged that appropriate policy would entail an initial increase in the federal funds rate by 
the end of 2015, markets saw about a 50 percent chance that the first increase would 
occur in September.  This probability fell to about 30 percent after global markets 
experienced a sudden bout of volatility following China’s surprise devaluation of its 
currency in August.  At the September meeting, the FOMC decided to wait to see how 
global markets and the e conomy evolved, noting in its statement that “R ecent global 
economic and financial developments may restrain economic activity somewhat and are 
likely to put further downward pressure on inflation in the near term .”13

press release, September  17, paragraph 2, 
www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20150917a .htm.   - 6 - 
A data -driven Committee, making decisio ns meeting by meeting, is likely to 
surprise markets from time to time.  The authors join many others in criticizing the 
“measured pace” period of 2004 through 2006, during which the Committee increased 
rates by 25 basis points at 17 consecutive FOMC meeti ngs.  A common criticism has 
been that this high level of predictability made investors complacent, encouraging a 
buildup of leverage and helping set the stage for  the Global Financial Crisis.  That 
criticism may well overstate the importance of the Commit tee’s communications; 
nonetheless, a number of FOMC participants have said that the Committee intends to be “data driven” and not fall into an excessively predictable, data -insensitive path.  Lower 
predictability implies more surprises.  
In the statement re leased after its October 2015 meeting, the Committee 
reemphasized data dependence and focused on the importance of incoming data for the 
Committee’s decision “at its next meeting,” which led the market to increase its estimated 
probability of a December ra te increase from 38 percent to 50 percent.
14  The October 
and November non-farm payroll reports came in strong and above expectations, raising 
that probability by the time of the December meeting to about 90 percent.  In other 
words, the Committee used mode st time -based guidance to set the stage and then let 
incoming data do the heavy lifting.   In the statement released after the FOMC’s most 
recent meeting in January, the Committee said that, in evaluating future adjustments to 
the target range for the feder al funds rate, it would “assess realized and expected 
economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent

inflation.”15  This language shows that the Committee has moved away from the time -
based guidance of the c risis years.  
Although time-based guidance can create communications challenges, I see other 
factors as having been more important in recent years.  In particular, the challenge of 
deciding when and how to use unconventional tools --and ultimately when and how to 
reduce t hat usage --is a great one.  The task of communicating clearly about those 
decisions is equally great.  And the reality of the FOMC’s size and diversity, not to mention uncertainty about the evolving structure of the economy and the effects of 
monetary poli cy actions, means that we are still far from the ideal world of a fully 
worked out, clearly specified and transparent consensus on what economists call a 
“reaction function” --a complete description of how policy will respond to changes in 
economic conditions.  
Often when communicating about the path of policy, it will be hard to avoid a 
combination of the two forms of guidance.  For example, the Committee has embraced 
the view that the equilibrium level of the federal funds rate is currently below its pre -
crisis level and expects the funds rate  to return only gradually to its longer -run value .
16  
This view is a key aspect of many Committee participants’ reaction functions, including mine.  Try saying that without referring to time.

press release, January 27, paragraph 4, 
www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20160127a.htm .  
16 For example, t he January 2016 FOMC s tatement  says, “ The Committee expects that economic conditions 
will e volve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate;  the federal funds 
rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.”  (Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve Syste m (2016), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,” press 
release, January 27, paragraph 4, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20160127a.htm .)  - 8 - 
The authors acknowledge that  the distinction between rules and discretion is too 
simple to capture the problems that monetary policymakers face.17  I would say the same 
of the distinction between time -based and data -based forward guidance.  
Lessons Learned and Suggested Improvements  
Before turning to the paper’s conclusions, I would like to put the Federal 
Reserve’s communications into a broader context.  In recent years, the FOMC has 
adopted many new and significant communications tools.  Since the fall of 2007, 
policymakers have submitted projections in conjunction with four FOMC meetings each 
year; in 2012, those projections were augmented to include each participant’s path for 
appropriate monetary policy.  In 2011, the Chair man began holding quarterly press 
conferences.  In 2012, t he Committee first released its statement on Longer -run Goals 
and Monetary Policy Strategy, which formalized the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation 
objective and is reaffirmed each year at the January meeting.  These and other changes 
have kept the Federal Reserve among the world’s most transparent central banks in its 
communications with the public.  
With that as background, I find significant grounds for agreement and further 
analysis in the paper’s concluding section, which lays out lessons learned and suggested 
improvements.  The discussion of what is colloquially known as the “dot plot” included 
in the SEP is particularly interesting.  The dot plot represents each FOMC participant’s 
                                                   
17 Feroli and others, “Language after Liftoff,” in note 1, p. 11; and Ben S. Bernanke and Frederic S. 
Mishkin ( 1997),  “Inflation Targeting:  A New Framework for Monetary Policy? ” Journal of Economic 
Perspectives , vol. 11 ( Spring ), pp. 97- 116.  - 9 - 
individual assessment of the path of the federal funds rate over the next three years that is 
most likely to promote maximum employment and stable prices.18 
The dot plot presents a number of challenges .  The individual dots are not tied to 
the individual macroeconomic forecasts presented in the SEP, and no information is 
provided on the identity of the forecaster --for example, voting members of the 
Committee are not distinguished from non- voting participants.  There is no easy path to 
the identification of a Committee reaction function.  The dots speak as of their date of publication af ter the FOMC meetings held in March, June, September, and December.  
Three months pass between SEPs.  The economic outlook can change quite significantly, 
making the reigning dots look out of touch.  On occasion, the dot plot and the 
postmeeting statement have seemed to send conflicting signals.  The dot plot reflects 
individual views of appropriate policy, while the postmeeting statement reflects the 
consensus of the Committee.  
The authors weigh these challenges and ponder whether to eliminate the dot plot ; 
some appear to favor that idea.
19  I doubt that most market participants would welcome 
the elimination of this chart.  The SEP provides a number of benefits .  It requires FOMC 
participants to write down their forecast s for inflation, unemployment , and growth, as 
                                                   
18 In the SEP collected prior to the March and June FOMC meetings, participants submit projections for the 
current calendar year and two subsequent years; in the September SEP, the forecast horizon is extended out 
an additional calendar year.  Thus, the fore cast window does not remain constant for the different SEPs in a 
given year; Wrightson commentary has suggested that a rolling forecast horizon might be an improvement over the current calendar -year focus (Wrightson ICAP (2016), “January 26- 27 FOMC Minutes  Recap,” 
February 18).  
19 For instance, Michael Feroli (as quoted in a recent article) said, “ I think they have outlived their 
usefulness and they risk sending a signal that (Fed officials) have a ‘ plan’ rather than that they are data 
dependent ” (see Ann Saphir ( 2016), “ Fed’s ‘Dot Plot’ Looks Increasingly out of Touch on Rates ,” Markets, 
Reuters, February 14, paragraph 8, http://in.reuters.com/article/us -usa-fed-path-analysi s-
idINKCN0VN0PU ); and in a 2012 speech, former Governor of the Bank of Canada Mark Carney stated, 
“Overall research has not generally found that publishing a path leads to better outcomes.”  (Mark Carney  
(2012) , “Guidance,” a speech delivered to the CFA Society Toronto, Toronto, Canada, December 11, 
paragraph 24, www.bankofcanada.ca/2012/12/guidance .   - 10 - 
well as their assessments of appropriate monetary policy.  This exercise helps 
policymakers to be more systematic.  In addition, by observing how the SEP changes 
over time, the public can better understand how Committee members react to changes in 
the economy.  My view is that the dot plot, on balance, is helpful to market participants 
and hence to the Committee.  As the dot plot enters its fifth year of existence, my hope is 
that we will be able to capture those benefits while avoiding its shortcom ings.  
I agree with the paper’s suggestion of greater emphasis on the degree of 
uncertainty around the projections, which is much larger than the dispersion of the 
individual forecasts.  As you know, at its January meeting, the Committee discussed  
adding fa n charts to the SEP.  Fan charts c ould help emphasize that the economic outlook 
is uncertain, and that consequently there is considerable uncertainty around the path of policy.  Discussion of “Language after Liftoff:

Fight ing Inflation  in Challenging Times  
 
 
 
Remarks by  
 
Michelle  W. Bowman  
 
Member  
 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  
 
at 
 
2022 CEO & Senior Management Summit  sponsored by  
the Kansas Bankers Association  
 
Colorado Springs , Colorado 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
August  6, 2022 
  
Thanks to the Kansas Bankers Association for the invitation to share my 
perspective on the economy and bank regulation.  It is always a pleasure to be here with 
you for this annual gathering.  I am especially looking forward to hearing what is on your 
mind s about supervision and regulation, how you are navigating current economic 
conditions, and your expectations going forward.   
I’ll start with a recap of the decision from July’s Federal Open Market Committee 
meeting and then move on to my thoughts about t he current economic uncertainty and 
challenges that lie ahead.  The number one challenge, of course, is inflation, which 
continues to be much too high, and a heavy burden for households and businesses.  As 
I’m sure you all already know, the Federal Open Ma rket Committee decided last week to 
raise the federal funds rate by 75 basis points, to a range of 2¼ to 2½ percent.  I will 
share my reasoning for supporting this increase and why I support continued increases 
until inflation is on a consistent path to significantly decline.  I will then touch on the current federal regulatory climate and the Fed’s agenda for supervision.  
Inflation continued to climb in June, reaching 9.1 percent as measured by the 
consumer price index.  This is yet another concerningly high reading, and it set another 
40-year record high despite the expectation of many forecasters that inflation had peaked earlier in the year.  I have seen few, if any, concrete indications that support this 
expectation, and I will need to see unambiguous evidence of this decline before I 
incorporate an easing of inflation pressures into my outlook.   
Many of the underlying causes of excessive inflation are the same as they have 
been over the past year or so—supply chain issues, including those related to C hina’s  - 2 - 
COVID containment policies, constrained housing supply, the ongoing conflict in 
Ukraine, fiscal stimulus , and limitations on domestic energy production.    
Regardless of the source of the inflationary pressure, the Federal Reserve has a 
duty to bring inflation down to our 2  percent target.  This duty is mandated by Congress 
to carry out monetary policy that results in price stability —meaning low and stable 
inflation.  We all understand why this is a critically important responsibility, especially in 
times of extreme inflation.  Rising prices for food, housing, and energy negatively impact 
affordability for all Americans, but especially those with low or moderate incomes.  For 
those workers who drive long distances to get to work, high inflation is especially 
concerning, requiring some to make tradeoffs between feeding their families and buying 
fuel to fill gas tanks.   Some workers have seen their wages grow significantly over the 
past two years, but most have seen any gains in wages far outpaced by hig her prices.  
Therefore, in my mind, it is absolutely critical that we continue to use our monetary 
policy tools until we are successful in returning inflation to our 2  percent goal.   
Businesses are also suffering from elevated inflation through rising and volatile 
prices for inputs and the need to price their own goods and services to cover costs without losing customers.  This dynamic is evident in agriculture and what we are hearing 
directly from farmers and ranchers, who are dealing with added weather challenges and 
on-going drought.  Prices for commodities have declined lately but are still at historically 
high levels.  In contrast, prices for fertilizer and many crop inputs continue to rise.  In 
some areas, high input costs and drought conditions are contributing to record early  
season cattle auction sales, as many ranchers choose to sell herds early to limit further outlays for input expenses.   - 3 - 
 I see a significant risk of high inflation into next year for necessities including 
food, housing, fuel, and vehicles.  Rents have grown dramatically, and while home sales 
have slowed, the continued increasing price of single -family homes indicates to me that 
rents won’t decline anytime in the near future.  Recently, gasoline prices have moderated 
but are still ro ughly 80 percent higher than pre -pandemic levels due to constrained 
domestic supply and the disruption of world markets.  And I see continued inflation risk from motor vehicle prices, as auto manufacturers struggle with supply chain problems 
that haven’t i mproved significantly.  Demand for cars continues to exceed supply, and 
retail used car prices are still very high, about 50  percent  more than before the pandemic.  
The supply problems pushing up inflation seem likely to persist.  Indications are 
that the c onflict in Ukraine will continue, and that the effects of shipping disruptions of 
agriculture products and limits on energy supplies from Russia will continue to be a 
significant problem.  Even with the recent agreement intended to facilitate Ukrainian 
grain exports, it is unclear whether supply pressures on global markets will ease as a 
result.  An announced reduction in Russian natural gas supplies to Western Europe has 
driven European prices even higher, causing ripple effects on world energy markets and 
raising concerns about shortages this winter.  China has eased some of its most stringent 
COVID containment measures but recently revived travel restrictions in some areas, and 
its approach to the pandemic remains an upside risk for inflation.  Despite a slowdown in 
sales of new and existing homes, inventories of homes for sale and rental vacancies 
remain low, supporting ongoing increases in housing costs.  
On the other side of our dual mandate, maximum employment, we continue to see 
a tight labor market, though there are some emerging signs that would support  - 4 - 
expectations of loosening.   Yesterday’s job report showed continued significant growth in 
hiring with the unemployment rate finally returning to the pre -pandemic level of 3.5 
percent.  As I am sure you  all know, the job market in Kansas is even stronger, with an 
unemployment rate of 2.4 percent in June.   In our state, finding workers is a bigger 
problem in most communities than finding a job.  
One aspect of the job market that has not recovered is labor  force participation.    
Based on the pre -pandemic trend, there are nearly four million people who are still sitting 
out of a strong labor market.  
In contrast to this labor market strength in Kansas and nationwide, output growth 
has slowed this year.  Real gross domestic product, GDP, edged lower in the second 
quarter, following a larger decline in the first quarter.      
My base case is for a pickup  in growth during the second half of this year and for 
moderate growth in 2023.  As we learned during the summer and fall of 2021, both GDP 
and jobs numbers are subject to significant revision, both in subsequent months and then again the next year.  From my perspective, had we known at the time about the eventual 
large upward revisions in last year’s employment data, we likely would have significantly 
accelerated our monetary policy actions.  Going forward, we have to consider the possibility of these kinds of revisions when making real -time judgments as policymakers, 
which includes looking at other kinds of indicators instead of relying too heavily on the data.  Taking all of that on board, while the data on economic activity are indeed lower 
and the view is murky, the evidence on inflation is absolutely clear, which brings me to 
the implications for monetary policy.   - 5 - 
Based on current economic conditions and the outlook I just described, I 
supported the FOMC’s decision last week to raise the federal funds ra te another 75 basis 
points.  I also support the Committee’s view that “ongoing increases” would be 
appropriate at coming meetings.  My view is that similarly -sized increases should be on 
the table until we see inflation declining in a consistent, meaningfu l, and lasting way.  
On the subject of forward guidance, I am pleased to see that following the July 
meeting, the FOMC ended the practice of providing specific forward guidance in our 
post-meeting communications.  I believe that the overly specific forward guidance 
implemented at the December 2020 FOMC meeting requiring “substantial further progress” unnecessarily limited the Committee’s actions in beginning the removal of 
accommodation later in 2021.  In my view, that, combined with data revisions that wer e 
directly relevant to our decision making, led to a delay in taking action to address rising 
inflation.    
It is helpful that the FOMC provided clear direction earlier this year that it was 
prepared to act quickly to tighten monetary policy.  Since we have now taken actions to 
raise rates and finally reduce the Fed’s balance sheet, we are following through on that 
commitment.  Looking ahead, the FOMC will be getting two months of data on inflation 
and another month on employment before our next meeting in September, and while I 
expect that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate, given the uncertainty in how those  
data and conditions will evolve, I will allow that information to guide my judgment on how big the increases will need to be.  
I do expect that the labor market will remain strong as we continue to increase 
interest rates and allow the balance sheet to run off, but there is a risk that our actions will  - 6 - 
slow job gains, or even reduce employment.  Growth has softened, and perhaps this is an 
indication that our actions to tighten monetary policy are having the desired effect, with 
the ultimate goal of bringing demand and supply into greater balance.  
When considering the risks to the labor market, these risks must be viewed in the 
context of its current strength and with the understanding that our primary challenge is to 
get inflation under control.  In fact, the larger threat to the strong labor market is 
excessive inflation, which if allowed to continue could lead to a further econom ic 
softening, risking a prolonged period of economic weakness coupled with high inflation, 
like we experienced in the 1970s.  
In any case, we must fulfill our commitment to lowering inflation, and I will 
remain steadfastly focused on this task.  
With my outl ook out of the way, let me turn to another of my responsibilities at 
the Fed, which is bank regulation and supervision.  I am sure that we will have the 
opportunity to discuss many issues of interest to you during our discussion, but I’d like to mention a pending rulemaking that would update the Community Reinvestment Act.  I 
understand that the draft rule was intended to provide greater clarity to banks regarding 
community development activities and their consideration for CRA.  While I am a strong 
support er of the fundamentals behind CRA, and I support community development 
activities, I am concerned that the proposal does not adequately account for the costs and benefits of certain provisions, and that no attempt has even been made to either ensure 
that o r to analyze whether the benefits exceed the costs, which is a fundamental element 
of effective regulation.  The comment period for the proposal ended on August 5, and I will repeat what I have said in the past: if this proposal affects you or your busines s, I  - 7 - 
hope that you made your voice heard by submitting a comment to the more than 600-
page proposal within the short 90-day comment period.  Public comments really do 
matter when considering the content of proposed rulemakings.  
Of course, my comments about the benefits of public participation in rulemaking 
apply beyond the CRA proposal, and there are other regulatory topics on the horizon that 
would benefit from robust engagement.  One that comes to mind is the regulatory 
framework for analyzing bank mergers.  Earlier this year, the Justice Department 
requested comment on whether to revise their 1995 Bank Merger Competitive Review 
guidelines, seeking input on a wide range of issues.  The FDIC also issued a request for information on the Bank Merger Act fram ework.  I expect this review will be a focus 
across the banking agencies, and I will be very interested to see how the framework for 
small and regional banks is affected by any proposed change.  I would be concerned 
about any changes that would result in m aking mergers among these institutions more 
difficult or would not address some of the longstanding issues with the existing 
framework.  Among those are that the framework doesn’t account for new technologies 
or overwhelming competition posed by credit uni ons, internet based financial services, 
and non-bank financial companies.  Another concern is that overly strict criteria for mergers could have the unintended consequence of depriving consumers in some areas of 
access to any banking services.  “Banking de serts” in rural and underserved areas are a 
real problem and regulators should guard against this outcome when proposing or 
evaluating rule s.   
I should also briefly mention three other regulatory topics of interest to all banks, 
including those here today.    - 8 - 
First, the Fed’s LIBOR proposal is currently out for comment on a short timeline.  
That proposal implements the recently passed LIBOR Act by providing default rules for 
certain contracts that use the soon to be discontinued reference rate.  Second, com ments 
are currently under review for the third-party risk management guidance jointly proposed 
by the Fed with the other banking agencies.  Banks and third parties will benefit from 
clear guidance that helps banks navigate the challenging issues and risks raised by third 
party engagement.   
Finally, another area that could benefit from more regulatory clarity is digital 
assets, including stablecoins and crypto assets.  Some banks are considering expanding 
into a range of crypto activities, including custody, lending backed by crypto collateral, 
and facilitating the purchase and sale of these assets for their customers.  In the absence 
of clear guidance, banks should consult with their primary regulator and exercise caution 
when engaging with customers in the se types of activities.  
I will conclude with a brief comment on supervision.  While the trend of returning 
to on-site bank examination is continuing, progress has been somewhat slow.  This may 
be driven in part by the varied pace of employees returning to the office.  That said, the 
Fed intends to return to some form of on -site supervision.  We find substantial value in 
those in -person interactions during bank examinations.  
In closing, thank you again for the opportunity to speak to you today.  I look 
forwa rd to hearing how high inflation is affecting you and your communities and your 
thoughts on the regulatory agenda.

Global Imbalances:  Links to Ec onomic and Financial Stability 
   
Remarks by 
 
Ben S. Bernanke 
 
Chairman 
 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
 
at the 
 
Banque de France Financial St ability Review Launch Event 
 
Paris, France 
       
February 18, 2011 By facilitating the allocati on of the world’s savings to the most productive uses, 
the free flow of capital across national borde rs confers substantia l economic benefits, 
including the promotion of economic growth.  That said, we have seen a number of 
episodes in which internati onal capital flows have brought with them challenges for 
macroeconomic adjustment, financial stabilit y, or both.  Such challenges have tended to 
arise in two situations:  first, when the “rul es of the game” of the international monetary 
system--the policy responses that countries are e xpected to take to help foster a balanced 
global economy over time--are either poorly ar ticulated or not observed by key countries; 
and second, when the financial systems of na tions receiving strong capital inflows have 
not been up to the task of inve sting those inflows productively.  
These issues are hardly new.  In the late 1920s and early 1930s, the U.S. dollar 
and French franc were undervalued, with the result that both c ountries experienced 
current account surpluses and strong capital inflows.  Under the unwritten but long-
standing rules of the gold standard, those tw o countries would have been expected to 
allow the inflows to feed through to domestic  money supplies and prices, leading to real 
appreciations of their curren cies and, with time, to a na rrowing of their external 
surpluses.  Instead, the two nations sterilized  the effects of these capital inflows on their 
money supplies, so that their currencies rema ined persistently undervalued.  Under the 
constraints imposed by the gold standard, thes e policies in turn increased deflationary 
pressures and banking-sector st rains in deficit countries su ch as Germany, which were 
losing gold and foreign deposits.  Ultimately, the unwillingness of the United States and 
France to conduct their domestic policies by the rules of the game, together with - 2 - 
 
 
 structural vulnerabilities in financial system s and in the gold standard itself, helped 
destabilize the global economic and financial system and bring on the Great Depression. 
The Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s illustrates a somewhat different type 
of risk associated with la rge cross-border flows of cap ital.  During the 1990s, strong 
capital inflows helped support robust growth in many Asian economies.  But Thailand’s 
devaluation in mid-1997 triggered closer sc rutiny of developments in the region.  
Investors began to recognize that the fi nancial systems of some Asian economies--
because of institutional weaknesses, inadequate  regulation, or other deficiencies--had not 
effectively channeled the surge of incoming funds into productive investments.  As 
foreign investors lost confiden ce, capital flows into the regi on reversed sharply, and the 
credit-driven boom came to a precipitous end.  The Asian crisis imposed heavy costs in 
terms of financial and macroeconomic instability  in the affected countries.  In this case, 
capital inflows posed a problem because of  weaknesses in the financial systems and 
regulatory oversight in countries  receiving foreign capital.   
Although these issues are now generally discussed in the context of emerging 
market economies, the United States--the recipient of the largest capital inflows in the world--has also faced challenges coping with capital inflows.  Notabl y, the failures of the 
U.S. financial system in allocating strong fl ows of capital, both domestic and foreign, 
helped precipitate the recent financial crisis  and global recession.  
Why was the United States, a mature econom y, the recipient of net capital inflows 
that rose to as much as 6 percent of its gross domestic product pr ior to the financial 
crisis?  A significant portion of these capital inflows re flected a broader phenomenon - 3 - 
 
 
 that, in the past, I have dubbed the global saving glut.1  Over the past 15 years or so, for 
reasons on which I have elaborated in earlie r remarks, many emerging market economies 
have run large, sustained current account su rpluses and thus have become exporters of 
capital to the advanced economies, especi ally the United States.  These inflows 
exacerbated the U.S. current account deficit a nd were also a factor pushing U.S. and 
global longer-term interest rate s below levels suggested by ex pected short-term rates and 
other macroeconomic fundamentals.    
My earlier comments on the global saving glut hypothesis focused on the sources 
of the capital inflows to the United States and their effects on globa l longer-term interest 
rates and the U.S. current account, without atte ntion to the composition of those flows.  
My paper for the Banque de France Financial Stability Review  extends the basic global 
saving glut hypothesis to consid er the portfolio preferences of foreign investors in the 
United States and the implications of those preferences.2  Several researchers have argued 
that capital flows from emerging markets to advanced economies will tend to be directed 
to the safest and most liquid assets, of whic h, these researchers argue, there is a relative 
shortage in emerging markets.3  My paper confirms empiri cally that the global saving 
glut countries--principally, some emer ging Asian economies and Middle Eastern oil

 exporters--did indeed evince a st rong preference for very safe  and liquid U.S. assets in 
the middle of the past decade, especi ally Treasury and agency securities. 
Although a large share of the net capital in flows to the United States came from 
emerging markets, substantial gross capital inflows were received from the advanced 
economies as well.  An additional contribution of the paper is to examine the portfolio 
preferences of these advanced economy, especially European, investors.  The paper finds 
that, like the global saving glut countries,  European investors placed a high value on 
safety and liquidity in their U.S. investme nts; however, relative to purchases by emerging 
markets, those of European investors encomp assed a broader range of U.S. securities, 
including sizable amounts of private-label mo rtgage-backed securitie s (MBS) as well as 
other highly rated asset-backed securities.  Unlike the globa l saving glut countries, which 
funded their acquisitions of U.S. assets thr ough their current account surpluses, Europe 
on net had a roughly balanced current account  and thus issued liabilities to fund 
acquisitions of U.S. assets.  However, as  these liabilities were tilted toward more 
traditional securities, including sovereign debt, as well as bank deposits, the result here too was a net increase in the global de mand for highly rated U.S. assets.  
The preferences of foreign investors for highly rated U.S. assets, together with 
similar preferences by many domestic investor s, had a number of implications, including 
for the relative yields on such assets.  Importantly, though, the preference by so many 
investors for perceived safety created strong incentives for U.S. financial engineers to 
develop investment products that “transformed” risky loans into highly  rated securities.  
Remarkably, even though a large share of new U.S. mortgages during the housing boom 
were of weak credit quality, financial engine ering resulted in the overwhelming share of - 5 - 
 
 
 private-label mortgage-related securities being rated AAA.  The underlying contradiction 
was, of course, ultimately exposed, at grea t cost to financial stability and the global 
economy. 
To be clear, these findings are not to be  read as assigning responsibility for the 
breakdown in U.S. financial intermediation to factors outside the Un ited States.  Instead, 
in analogy to the Asian cr isis, the primary cause of  the breakdown was the poor 
performance of the financial system and fina ncial regulation in the country receiving the 
capital inflows, not the inflows themselves.  In the case of the United States, sources of 
poor performance included misaligned incentiv es in mortgage origination, underwriting, 
and securitization; risk-management deficien cies among financial in stitutions; conflicts 
of interest at credit rating agencies; weaknesses in the capitalization and incentive structures of the government-sponsored enterpri ses; gaps and weaknesses in the financial 
regulatory structure; a nd supervisory failures.
4  In reflecting on this experience, I have 
gained increased appreciation for the challenges faced by policymakers in emerging 
market economies who have had to manage large and sometimes volatile capital inflows 
for the past several decades. 
The global financial crisis is receding, but capital flows are once again posing 
some notable challenges for international macroeconomic and financial stability.  These capital flows reflect in part the continued two-speed nature of th e global recovery, as

 economic growth in the emerging markets is  far outstripping growth in the advanced 
economies.5   
In light of the relatively muted recoveries  to date in the advanced economies, the 
central banks of those economies have ge nerally continued accommodative monetary 
policies.  Some observers, wh ile acknowledging that an aborte d recovery in the advanced 
economies would be highly detrimental to  the emerging market economies, have 
nevertheless argued that these monetary polic ies are generating negative spillovers.  In 
particular, concerns have centered on the strength of private cap ital flows to many 
emerging market economies, which, dependi ng on their policy responses, could put 
upward pressure on their currencies, boost their inflation rates, or lead to asset price 
bubbles.   
Although policymakers in the emergi ng markets clearly face important 
challenges, such concerns should be put into perspective.  First, these capital flows have 
been driven by many factors, including expectations of more-rapid growth and thus 
higher investment returns in the emerging market economies than in the advanced 
economies.  Indeed, recent data  suggest that the aggregate flows to emerging markets are 
not out of line with longe r-term trends.  Second, as I not ed earlier, emerging market 
economies have a strong interest in a con tinued economic recovery  in the advanced 
economies, which accommodative monetary po licies in the advanced economies are 
intended to promote.  Third, policymakers in the emerging markets have a range of 
powerful--although admittedly imperfect--tools that they can use to manage their 
economies and prevent overheating, including ex change rate adjustment, monetary and

 fiscal policies, and macroprudential measures.  Finally, it should be borne in mind that 
spillovers can go both ways.  For example, resurgent demand in the emerging markets has contributed significantly to the sharp recent run-up in global commodity prices.  
More generally, the maintena nce of undervalued currencies by some countries has 
contributed to a pattern of global spending th at is unbalanced and unsustainable.  Such 
imbalances include those not only between emerging markets and advanced economies, but also among the emerging market economies themselves, as those countries that have 
allowed their exchange rates to be determined  primarily by market fo rces have seen their 
competitiveness erode relative to countries th at have intervened more aggressively in 
foreign exchange markets.     
Our collective challenge is to reshape the international monetary system to foster 
strong, sustainable growth and improve econom ic outcomes for all nations.  Working 
together, we need to clarify and strengthen the rules of the game, with an eye toward 
creating an international syst em that more effectively supports the simultaneous pursuit 
of internal and external bala nce.  To achieve a more bala nced international system over 
time, countries with excessive and unsustaina ble trade surpluses will need to allow their 
exchange rates to better reflect market f undamentals and increase their efforts to 
substitute domestic demand for exports.  At  the same time, countries with large, 
persistent trade deficits must find ways to increase national saving, including putting 
fiscal policies on a more sustai nable trajectory.  In addition, to bolster our individual and 
collective ability to manage a nd productively invest capital infl ows, we must continue to 
increase the efficiency, transparency, and resi liency of our national financial systems and 
to strengthen financial regulation and oversight. - 8 - 
 
 
 None of these changes will be easy or immediate.  To help us achieve them, we 
must continue to strengthen our mechanisms for international cooperation, including in 
the Basel Committee, the Financial Stability  Board, and the Group of Twenty Mutual 
Assessment Process, and work together to enhance surveillance by the International

August 26, 2020 - 2 -  
Good afternoon. I t’s great to be with you, and I look forward to our  discussion.  
 
As you all know, the COVID -19 pandemic has caused significant disruption and hardship 
in nearly every aspect of our lives, and it continues to weigh heavily on our national 
economy, which is why it will be the central focus of my remarks here  today .  Let me set 
the stage for our discussion by outlining the economic effects of the pandemic most relevant to the banking sector, describing the Federal Reserve’s response to the crisis, and then making some observations about conditions for smaller banks. 
The Pandemic’s Effects on the Economy and Banking  
 
We began this year with the economy in excellent shape —by some measures the 
strongest in decades .  From my seat as a monetary policymaker, we appeared to be in a 
good position regarding both legs of  our dual mandate , which are maximum 
employment and stable prices.  
But that picture was dramatically altered with the onset of the COVID -19 
pandemic .  Efforts to contain the spread of the virus caused a sudden stop in economic 
activity during March and Apr il.  While the extent of the closures and shutdowns varied 
widely throughout the country, the sudden loss of employment and the contraction in 
output were like nothing our nation has experienced before.  
The decline in activity was mostly due to temporary business closures, and the 
economy has bounced back noticeably in recent months  as businesses reopen and fiscal 
support was distributed to many Americans .  Even so, the economy is still far from back 
to normal .  The future course and timing of the recovery is still highly uncertain, and its 
pace and intensity are likely to vary across areas of the country—heavily influenced by 
the decisions of state and local governments.  That speaks to another aspect of this episode that is  unusual —how the timing and sever ity of the pandemic’s impact seem to 
differ greatly  from one area to the next . 
Among Kansas’ s major industries, oil and gas production and equipment - 3 -  
manufacturing have been hurt by the worldwide slump in energy demand.  Aviation 
manufacturing has been hit hard by the downturn and by the uncertainty over the recovery in air travel.  Agriculture continues to face challenges but is faring somewhat better than many sectors of the economy .  Ag producers are still facing tough financial 
conditions , including the low commodity price environment .  While most indications are 
that agriculture land prices continue to hold fairly steady, I have seen some reports that less-productive  land has been show ing some hints of cracks in valuations.  
Turning to employment, nationwide, we know that the initial job losses were 
heavily concentrated among the most financially vulnerable, including lower -wage 
workers, young people, women, and minority groups .  According to the Fed’s latest 
Report on The Economic Well -Being of U.S. Households , 20 percent of people surveyed 
in April reported a recent job loss.  Among those surveyed who live in households with 
annual incomes below $40,000, the reported job loss was nearly double that, at around 
40 percent.
1  That said, b oth of those figures  are likely to include  a number of layoffs 
due to pandemic -related shutdowns of businesses  that were hopefully only temporary.   
Households were in a generally strong financial position at the beginning of this 
year, but the restrictions implemented  to fight COVID -19 resulted in an unprecedented 
spike in unemployment, which likely led to a number of families find ing it difficult to 
keep up with their payment obligations .  That is  especially true for lower- income 
households , which may have had much le ss of a financial cushion before the onset of the 
crisis .  Along with our monetary policy actions, s timulus checks and enhanced 
unemployment benefits provided in the CARES Act have been a substantial and timely source of financial support to households dur ing this difficult time.

in 2019 - May 2020  (Washington: Board of Governors, May 2020),  
https://www.federalreserve.gov/publicatio ns/2020 -economic -well-being -of-us-households -in-2019-
preface.htm . - 4 -  
Understanding the financial stress this could place on many borrowers, the Fed 
and other federal regulators implemented guidance to encourage banks to work with their 
borrowers .  By mid-July, only around 8 percent of outstanding residential mortgage loans 
were in forbearance, well below what many industry observers had feared.  It remains possible that the economic challenges will persist beyond the forbearance time period 
provided in the CARES Act, and if so, we would almost certainly see some of these loans 
transition into longer -term delinquency status or enter into renewed deferment periods.  
Thus far, however, the data have been encouraging. 
Turning to the impact on businesses, we know the effects have been most severe 
in the services sector, especially travel , leisure, and hospitality.  To give some sense of 
the losses, employment in the leisure and hospitality sector s nationwide was down 
nearly 40 percent in the 12 months through May  and still down about 25 percent 
through July .  Retail employment fell 15 percent  over March and April, though it has 
recovered substantially since then, and in July it was 6 percent  below the pre -COVID 
level . 
It is encouraging to see that even those sectors most heavily aff ected by the 
crisis are finding ways to innovate .  Stores are adjusting hours and ramping up delivery, 
restaurants are changing menus and creating outdoor space, distilleries shif ted from 
making bourbon to hand sanitizers, and independent businesses that hadn’t previously relied heavily on technology are now using it to stay connected to customers and regulate workflow.  
Timely and supportive fiscal and monetary policy measures also have helped, but 
with the progress of the recovery still tentative , I expect  that many businesses will 
continue t o fight for survival in the months ahead, with the support of their lenders and 
communities. 
Looking ahead, the economic outlook will continue to evolve quickly.  We - 5 -  
experienced a pronounced and very welcome bounceback in national retail spending and 
housing activity over the early summer months .  We also saw positive news on progress 
toward a vaccine  and in the effective treatment of patients.  Even so , positive cases and 
hospitalizations have  risen in some areas and continue  to weigh on some regions and the 
overall economy.  As Chair Powell has noted, the timeline for the recovery is highly 
uncertain and will depend heavily on the course of the pandemic.  We must therefore 
recognize that progress toward a full recover y in economic activity may well be slow 
and uneven  
The Fed’s Response to the Pandemic  
 
Now let me turn to the Federal Reserve’s role in the government’s response to the 
pandemic .  During the initial phase of the crisis, we took a number of actions to stabi lize 
financial markets that came under intense stress, including purchasing sizable  amounts of 
Treasury and mortgage -backed securities.  To support households and businesses, the 
Fed quickly lowered our target for the federal funds rate, which has helped t o lower 
borrowing costs but create d a different challenge for financial institutions —depressed 
net interest margins .  The Fed has also supported actions by Congress and the 
administration by creating a number of new emergency lending programs .  These 
progr ams were designed to restore and sustain proper functioning in certain financial 
markets that had seized up in March and to facilitate the continued flow of credit from 
banks to households and businesses.  
One federal stimulus program that relied heavily on  the participation and 
expertise of community bankers is the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) .  Working 
through banks, the PPP program has delivered more than $500 billion to small  businesses 
to help them weather the storm .  Community bankers played a crucial role in getting 
these funds  to businesses that needed it, showing once again how essential community 
banks are to the customers they serve .  And in response to feedback we received from a - 6 -  
number of community bankers, the Fed created the PPP lending fa cility to alleviate 
balance -sheet capacity issues for banks that otherwise would not have been able to 
provide PPP loans to their small -business  customers.  
The PPP was created to help small businesses keep their employees on staff, and 
the Main Street Lending program is designed to support lending to mid- sized businesses 
through the re covery.  The Federal Reserve has not engaged in lending directly to 
businesses before, but it was a step that seemed appropriate considering the breadth and 
depth of the c hallenges we face.  We continue to solicit feedback and make adjustments 
to the program based on the suggestions received from bankers and other stakeholders, and we continue to welcome your thoughts and ideas on how we can make Main Street more effective.  I would be interested to visit with those who may already have experience with this new loan program, and I would also be interested to hear about how you plan to use it to meet the needs of your business customers.  
Together, these policy actions have he lped stabilize financial markets, boost 
consumer and business sentiment, and assist millions of households and thousands of businesses harmed by the response to the pandemic .  Credit markets, which had seized up 
earlier this year, have resumed functioning. 
In our other role as a prudential regulator and bank supervisor, the Federal 
Reserve took several steps intended to reduce burden on banks and help them focus on the needs of their customers and communities.  
Together, with our fellow federal regulators, w e delayed the impact of the CECL 
accounting standard in our capital rules and temporarily eased the leverage ratio 
requirement for community banks .  We also delayed reporting dates for Call Reports and 
other data collections .  In addition, to address conce rns about real estate appraisal delays, 
we provided temporary relief from certain appraisal requirements.  
From a supervisory perspective, beginning in late March the Fed paused - 7 -  
examinations for most small banks and took steps to lengthen remediation timefr ames for 
outstanding issues .  We considered the exam pause an important step to provide bankers 
time to adjust operations to protect the health of customers and employees , to prioritize 
the financial needs of their customers and communities , and to play an  essential and vital 
role in implementing critical relief programs like the PPP.  
As we continue to support the recovery and work to ensure that supervision and 
examination is as effective and efficient as possible, I think it’s important to hear directly 
from you, who are actually working in the economy, about the conditions facing your 
communities and any challenges impeding your ability to meet the needs of your customers.  In addition to my regular outreach to community banks, I am currently engaged in a n effort to speak with every CEO of the more than 650 community banks 
supervised by the Fed.  I want to hear directly from bankers about what you are seeing 
and your thoughts and ideas about the recovery.  These conversations are incredibly 
valuable to me as a bank regulator and policymaker .  They give context to the mountains 
of data we analyze and a unique perspective with real -world local examples to a complex 
and dynamic economic picture .  For those of you from  Fed member banks who  I have 
not yet had the opportunity to meet or speak with by phone in these  times  of COVID, I 
look forward to our conversation.  Your local Reserve Bank will be in contact to find a 
convenient time for us to meet. 
Conditions for Smaller Banks  
 
This audience knows better than most that smaller banks entered the pandemic in 
strong condition.  At the end of 2019, over 95 percent of community and regional banks 
supervised by the Fed were rated a 1 or 2 under the CAMEL S rating system .  After 
coming through the last financial crisis  in generally stronger condition than larger banks, 
smaller institutions had strengthened their capital positions and substantially improved asset quality in the years since, leaving them better positioned to deal with the current - 8 -  
stress related to the pan demic .  Likewise, credit concentrations, especially in 
construction and commercial real estate, were lower for smaller banks than at the outset 
of the last financial crisis, and risk management of concentrations improved over the last 
decade.  Smaller bank s also entered the pandemic with high levels of liquidity, and this 
liquidity has further improved with deposit inflows associated with pandemic -related 
stimulus programs.    
Overall, community and regional banks remain well positioned to continue to 
extend credit and play an essential role in supporting our  nation’s recover y from the 
effects of COVID- 19. 
With this in mind, on June 15 the Federal Reserve announced our plan to resume 
bank examinations .  We recognize the unique and challenging conditions under  which the 
industry has been operating, and we will certainly consider that as we resume 
examinations .  Our initial focus will be to assess higher risk banks, particularly those with 
credit concentrations in higher risk or stressed industries .  Finally, we  will continue to be  
sensitive to the capacity of each bank to participate in examinations and strive to prevent undue burden on banks struggling with crisis -related operational challenges.  
The Road Ahead  
 
Like many native Kansans, I am an eternal optimist, so let me end my formal 
remarks on a hopeful note .  While the road ahead is highly uncertain, and we don’t yet 
know when the economy will re turn to its previous strength , America will recover from 
this crisis, as it has from all of our past challenges .  Our economic f undamentals  are 
strong, and we have the solid foundation of the entrepreneurial spirit and resiliency of 
the American people .  For its part, the Federal Reserve will continue to monitor progress 
and respond promptly and flexibly to support the recovery.  We will closely watch 
economic and financial conditions , and we will use our monetary policy tools to respond 
as appropriate to pursue our dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. - 9 -  
We will also remain open to further adju stments to supervisory schedules and 
expectations, as needed.  
Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today.  I look forward to our 
discussion.  ",2020-08-26,bowman

“Economic Mobility:  Research and Ideas on Strengthening Families,  
Communities , and  the Economy ,” a community development research conference 
sponsored by the Federal Reserve System  
 
Washington, D.C. 
 
 
 
    
April 2 , 2015 
  
It is my pleasure to welcome you to the Federal Reserve System’s community 
development r esearch c onference, which this year focuses on economic mobility.  I 
would like to commend the organizers for their foresight in choosing a topic that has 
risen to the top of the global agenda.  According to a recent Pew Research Center survey, the gap between rich  and poor now ranks as a major concern in the minds of citizens 
around the world.  In advanced economies still feeling the effects of the Great Recession, people worry that children will grow up to be worse off financially than their parents were.  In the United States, roughly 80 percent of Americans across the ideological spectrum see inequality as a moderately big or very big problem.
1   
Economic inequality has long been of interest within the Federal Reserve System.  
In 2007, Chairman Bernanke delivered a speech on the causes of rising inequality that 
raised questions about the implications of this disturbing  trend for economic 
opportunity --the topic that will be explored at this conference today and tomorrow.2  
Chairman Bernanke’s speech called for more research to understand the causes and the effects of widening inequality in the United States.  Last October, I drew on the Fed’s 
Survey of Consumer Finances --a rich source of data for researchers in this field --to 
explore some factors that may influence economic mobility, such as access to quality 
education and ownership of a family business, and I discussed how those factors may have changed over time.
3  But I noted the difficulty of reaching definitive conclusions

and, like Chairman Bernanke, expressed my hope that more research would be dedicated 
to finding answers to these important questions.   
I hope that the work that has been gathered  and will be  presented and discussed at 
this conference-- as well as the research it may  inspire --will further this w orthy goal.  In 
carrying out its responsibilities, the Federal Reserve serves the public in a number of different ways, and I believe an important contribution comes via the Fed’s role as a research institution.  Separate from the work that directly suppor ts the Fed’s decisions on 
monetary policy and financial oversight, Fed economists and other researchers in Washington and at each of the 12 Reserve Banks are engaged in a broad array of independent academic research aimed at adding to the general knowledge and 
understanding of the economy.   
Each year, Fed staff members publish hundreds of papers and others forms of 
research, sometimes in collaboration with scholars from universities and other 
institutions, all of it available for use by the research commun ity and on view to the 
public.  Conferences play an integral role in promoting the Federal Reserve ’s research 
mission as well.  This biennial c ommunity development r esearch conference, organized 
by community development officials from across the Federal Reserve System, serves to encourage high- quality research and also helps bridge the gap between community 
development research, policy, and practice.   
In my brief remarks, I  woul d like to mention a few aspects of economic mobility 
that I think are particula rly important and worthy of further research, with the hope of 
stimulating the conversation that will take place here over the next couple of days.  This

conference will explore economic mobility as it is influenced by or affects families, 
communities, and the economy, so let me touch on each of those three facets.  
We know that families are the locus of both opportunities and barriers to 
economic mobility.   There are important research questions to be tackled here.  What 
individual or family characteristics  may predict who will achieve upward mobility?  How 
much does someone’s initial circumstances in life influence how far that person can get or how hard he or she need s to work to get there?  Researchers and policymakers need a 
better understanding of how m uch mobility individuals may experience over the course 
of their lives and at what age people’s outcomes may become more difficult to change.  
Families are the source of many of the resources and experiences that influence 
economic mobility, and more resear ch can help us understand to what extent and in 
which ways differences in the economic circumstances of families affect the upward mobility and economic security of offspring.  Research may be able to provide evidence 
on which public policies are most helpful in building an economy in which people are poised to get ahead.  Conversely, it would also be beneficial to understand whether any policies may hold people back or discourage upward mobility.  
There is some debate on how the level of economic mobility i n the United States 
may have changed in recent decades and whether it is easier or more difficult for people to get ahead today than it was in previous generations.  Shortly, you will hear from a 
panel of distinguished experts with a range of views on this  topic.  Looking at the very 
recent past, we should also be asking whether and how this may have changed coming out of the Great Recession.  Later, my Federal Reserve Board colleague, Governor 
Brainard, will speak on a topic of significant interest to me and I expect to many others -- - 4 - 
how young adults are faring in the economy and what the short - and long -term 
implications may have been for entering the  job market at a time of significantly 
constrained opportunities.  This is another example of how exogenous factors --those over 
which individuals have little or no control --may play an important role in determining 
how easily someone is able to improve his  or her circumstances.   
Communities also affect economic mobility, and here , too, more research is 
needed to understand how and to what extent these effects occur.  Economists do not 
fully understand how locational differences affect economic mobility or the complex relationship between economic mobility and geographic mobility.  There are community characteristics --for instance, the composition and level of local employment, schools, 
transportation, physical infrastructure, and community facilities --that may affect the 
economic mobility of the residents of that community.  And there is also a community development analogue to economic mobility:  Further research may help us better 
understand why some communities succeed or fail in generating jobs, developi ng 
successful small businesses, attracting infrastructure  investment , and so on.  How do 
some places advance economically and create circumstances in which residents, in turn, are more likely to thrive?  
Finally, there are important research questions to be  answered about the 
relationship between economic mobility and the economy as a whole.  It seems obvious that greater economic opportunity and mobility promotes a healthier economy.  Entrepreneurship, innovation, and hard work --surely key contributors to i ndividual 
mobility --are central to a strong economy as well.  But research could help us better 
understand how much mobility at the individual level matters for overall growth in  - 5 - 
productivity and economic output .  To what extent is income mobility influenc ed by 
domestic or global economic forces, and to what extent can we promote mobility through 
domestic policy choices?  
These are among the questions that will be discussed and debated at this 
conference.  You have a terrific lineup of speakers, and I think it is going to be a fascinating and informative two days.  Thank you again to the many people at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the Federal Reserve Board, and from across the System who have put this conference together .  And thanks to all of you f or coming here to be a part 
of it.

Monetary Policy in the Post -Crisis Era  
 
 
 
Remarks by 
 
Jerome H. Powell  
 
Chair  
 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  
 
at 
 
“Bretton Woods:  75 Years Later —Thinking about the Next 75,”  
a conference organized by  
the Banque de France and the French Ministry for the Economy and Finance   
 
Paris, France 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
July 16, 2019 
  
Seventy- five years ago this month, the foremost  economic and policy minds of 
their generation gathered in a sleepy mountain town in New England.  While World 
War II still raged, they envisioned a new international monetary system with rules, 
procedures, and institutions —including the International Mone tary Fund (IMF) and the 
World Bank—to promote recovery and stability in a war -ravaged world.   
Today we gather in Paris, the City of Light , to recognize their vision.  T he Bretton 
Woods institutions played a pivotal role after the war in rebuilding economi es and in 
facilitating the international economic relations that are essential to prosperity.  
Generations later , the World Bank and the IMF continue to play important role s in 
fostering  global monetary cooperation, financial stability, and international trade , as well 
as in promot ing sustainable economic growth and reducing poverty.    
In 1944, those who sat around the table at the M ount Washington Hotel knew that 
the trauma and tragedy of the war  and the Great Depression had fundamentally altered 
the eco nomic systems that preceded them.  For us, around our dinner table s tonight , a 
decade has passed since the Global Financial Crisis.  Although  in no way comparable to  
the devastating events of the 1930s and 1940s, the crisis  represents the deepest and 
broadest financial upheaval  since th at era , and in many ways , we, too, are grappling with 
a changed world.    
Today’s conference has looked at this post -crisis environment and the issues we 
now face from many angles.  I am grateful to  the Banque de France for organizing this 
important event  and to the outstanding speakers for their deep insights.  Tonight I  will 
offer some thoughts on this new environment.  I will begin with a discuss ion of  current 
economic conditions  in the United States , and then highlight  som e significant structural  - 2 - 
changes in the environment facing monetary policymakers  in the post -crisis era.  F inally, 
I will consider how these structural changes are affecting the framework in which we 
conduct monetary policy, highlighting the Federal  Reserve System ’s ongoing review of 
our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication s.  
The U.S. economy is now in its 11th consecutive year of growth.  Unemployment 
has steadily declined from its 10  percent  post -crisis peak and has now remained at o r 
below 4 percent  for more than a year , the longest stretch  in a half century.  A strong labor 
market with p lentiful job openings ha s supported labor force participation.  After rising 
only grudgingly early in the recovery, wages have moved up the past few  years.  S ome 
groups, such as African Americans, Hispanics, and rural Americans, continue to face  
long- standing challenges, but the  benefits of this strong job market are increasingly 
widely shared.  At outreach events we are holding across the United Stat es, we are 
hearing loud and clear  that this long recovery is now benefiting  low- and moderate -
income communities to a greater extent tha n has been felt for decades.  M any people who 
have struggled to stay in the workforce are now getting an opportunity to add new and 
better chapters to their life stories .   
Solid growth has sustained this strong labor market .  Most recently, U.S. gross 
domestic product (GDP) increased  at an annual rate of just over 3  percent in the first 
quarter, similar to last year’s strong pace.   But first- quarter growth  was driven largely by 
net exports and inventories —two volatile spending categories that are typically not 
dependable indicators of ongoing momentum.  In deed, overall growth in the second 
quarter appears to have moderated.  Growth in consumer spending, which was soft in the 
first quarter, looks to have bounced back, but business fixed investment  growth seems to  - 3 - 
have slowed notably.  Moreover, the manufact uring sector has been weak  since the 
beginning of the year , in part weighed down by the softer business spending, weaker 
growth in the global economy, and, as our business contacts tell us, concerns about trade 
tensions .   
Despite low unemployment and solid overall growth, inflation pressures remain 
muted.  After running close to the Federal Open Market Committee’s ( FOMC ) symmetric 
2 percent objective over much of last year, both overall consumer price inflation and core 
inflation moved down earlier this year .  We currently estimate that the change in the core 
personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index was 1.7 percent over the 
12 months ending in June.   
In our baseline outlook, we expect  growth in the United States to remain solid, 
labor markets to stay strong, and inflation to move back up and run near  2 percent.  
Uncertainties about this  outlook have increased, however, particularly regarding trade 
developments and global growth.  In addition, issues such as the U. S. federal debt ceiling 
and Brexit  remain unresolved.  FOMC participants have also raised concerns about a 
more prolonged shortfall in inflation below our 2 percent target.  Market -based measures 
of inflation compensation have shifted down, and some survey- based expectations 
measures are near the bottom of their historic al ranges.   
Many FOMC participants judged at the time of our most recent meeting in June 
that the  combination of these  factors strengthen s the case for a somewhat  more 
accommodative stance of policy .  We are carefully monitoring these developments  and 
assessing  their implications for the U.S economic outlook and inflation, and will act as  - 4 - 
appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its 
symmetric 2  percent objective . 
We will also assess these developments in the context of the broader structural 
changes monetary policymakers have been  facing  since the Great Recession.  I will focus 
on three  tonight :  the changed macroeconomic b ackdrop, the expanded toolkit , and the 
heightened focus on communication and transparency .   
In the United States, from the mid -1980s to right before  the Great Recession, PCE 
inflation  averaged 2.6 percent a year,  GDP growth 3 .4 percent, and the interest r ate on a 
10-year Treasury note 6.5 percent.  Since the trough of the Great Recession, average 
inflation and output  growth are around 1 percentage point  lower , and the 10 -year 
Treasury rate has averaged 2.4 percent .  These declines are not unique to the United 
States.  Average inflation rates for the other major advanced economies have declined by 
almost half, while the inflation rates of major emerging market economies are less than 
one-fifth of what they were.  Indeed, w ith few exceptions , we are all facing lower rates of 
interest, growth, and inflation.  In a number of countries, including the United States, 
these declines have been accompanied by strong labor markets and a much lower 
unemployment  rate. 
Such changes in the macroeconomic environment  are significant because the 
long- run normal  levels of inflation, output, interest rates , and the unemployment rate are 
important structural features by which we guide policy.  Standard estimates of the natural 
rate of unemployment —u*—and the neutral rate of in terest —r*—have been declining 
for 2 decades, and particularly since the crisis.   - 5 - 
Many factors are contributing to the se changes —well-anchored inflation 
expectations  in the context of improved monetary policy, demographics, globalization, 
slower  productivity  growth, greater demand for safe assets, and weaker links between 
unemployment and inflation.  And these factors seem  likely to persist .  If that happens, 
the neutral rate of interest will remain low, and policymakers will continue to operate  in 
an environment in which the  risk of hitting the effective lower bound is much higher than 
before the crisis.  This p roximity to the lower bound poses new complications for  central 
banks and calls for new ideas.  
It is true that m any of the se features have been with us for some time.  T rend 
inflation, productivity, and interest rates were  declining well  before the crisis.  But, for 
monetary policymakers in that era , the threat of high inflation felt proximate , the hard -
fought battle to control high inf lation having been just recently won.  T echnological 
progress seemed likely to continue to sustain rapid increases in productivity—an outcome 
we continue to await .  And the effective lower bound for interest rates was mainly a 
theoretical concern, except of course in Japan .  The changes to the macroeconomic 
environment may have been in train earlier, but the crisis seems to have accelerated the 
process.  T he world in which policymakers are now operating is discretely different in 
important ways from the one  before the Great Recession.   
I should also note, as is fitting given this event and this audience, that since the 
crisis policymakers are even more keenly aware of the relevance of global factors to our 
policies .  The global  nature of the financial crisi s and the channels through which it 
spread sharply highlight  the interconnectedness of our economic, financial, and policy 
environment s.  U.S. economic developments affect the rest of the world , and t he reverse  - 6 - 
is also true.   For example , the stresses surr ounding the euro crisis and, later, the China -
related volatility events in 2015 and 2016 led to a general pullback in demand for risky 
assets that put downward pressure on U.S. interest rates and weighed on U.S. confidence 
and growth.  In addition, we  have seen how monetary policy in one country can influence 
economic and financial conditions in others through financial market s, trade, and 
confidence channels.  Pursuing our domestic mandate s in this new world requires that we 
understand the anticipated effects of these interconnections and incorporate them into our 
policy decisionmaking.  
A second important feature of this new world is the tools central bankers now 
have to fight recessions .  In the face of the dramatic economic and financial collapse 
during the crisis , policymakers quickly exhausted conventional monetary policy tools and 
employed a range of unconventional measures to support the ir econom ies.   
In the United States, these measures included new forms of forward guidance and 
a range of balance sheet policies.   Broadly across  different  economies , so-called 
unconventional monetary policies have generally been successful at lowering interest 
rates and supporting economic recovery, though cyclical and structural headwinds have 
made achieving our  inflation targets a challenge.  A legacy of the crisis is that 
policymakers now have a broader range of tested tools to turn to the next time the 
effective lower bound is reached.  We must continue to assess additional strategies and 
tools to bolster our economies and meet our inflation and employment mandates.  
Finally, t he crisis and Great Recession  brought into stark relief the need for 
transparency and accountability for central banks.  Central bank communication is 
increasingly important and increasing ly challenging.  It is important because clear,  - 7 - 
transparen t communication about the economy, the risks, and our policy responses is 
critical for the effectiveness of our tools and for our accountability to the public  in a 
democratic society .  
It is challen ging, because we are operating in a changing macroeconomic 
environment with tools that , while no longer new, remain less familiar to the public .  
Moreover, our audience has become more varied, more attuned to our actions, and less 
trusting of public instit utions.  Gone are the days when the Federal Reserve Chair could 
joke, as my predecessor Alan Greenspan did, “ If I turn out to be particularly clear, you’ve 
probably misunderstood what I said.” 1  Central banks must speak to Main Street, as well 
as Wall Street, in ways we have  not in the past , and Main Street  is listening and engaged. 
Where does this leave us , and how should policymaker s adapt to this  new 
environment?   Recognizing challenges posed by the changing structure of the economy, 
the need for effective policy responses, and the importance of clear communication, 
central banks are taking a closer look at their strategies and the range of tools currently at 
their disposal.  For example, t he Bank of Canada examin es its framework every five 
years as part of the renewal of its inflation -control agreement with the federal 
government.  Canadian officials have announced the bank will “ assess a broad range of 
monetary policy frameworks ahead of the renewal in 2021” of t his agreement.2  The

Opening Remarks

Before our discussion, I will take a few minutes to discuss recent economic data 
and the outlook for monetary policy.   
Recent Economic Data  
Incoming data over recent months show ongoing progress toward both of our dual 
mandate goals —maximum employment and stable prices.  
Inflation  
By the time the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised rates in March 
2022, it was clear that restoring price stability would require both the unwinding of pandemic -related distortions to supply and demand, and also restrictive monetary policy 
to cool strong demand and give supply time to catch up.  These forces are now working together to bring inflation down.  
After peaking at 7.1 percent in June 2022, 12- month headline PCE (personal 
consumption expenditure) inf lation is estimated at 3.5 percent through September.
1  Core 
PCE inflation, which omits the volatile food and energy components, provides a better indicator of where inflation is heading.  Twelve -month core PCE inflation peaked at 5.6 
percent in February 2022 and is estimated at 3.7 percent through September.    
Inflation readings turned lower over the summer, a very favorable development.  
The September inflation data continued the downward trend but were somewhat less 
encouraging.  Shorter -term measures of core inflation over the most recent three and six 
months are now running below 3 percent.  But these shorter -term measures are often 
volatile.  In any case, inflation is still too high, and a few months of good data are only 
 
1 Descriptions of PCE inflation include Board staff estimates of the September  2023 values based on 
available information, including the September  2023 consumer price index and producer price index data. 
The September  2023 PCE inflation data will be publishe d by the Bureau of Economic Analysis on October 
27, 2023.   - 2 - 
the beginning of what it wil l take to build confidence that inflation is moving down 
sustainably toward our goal.  We cannot yet know how long these lower readings will 
persist, or where inflation will settle over coming quarters.  While the path is likely to be bumpy and take some t ime, my colleagues and I are united in our commitment to 
bringing inflation down sustainably to 2 percent.    The labor market  
In the labor market, strong job creation has met a welcome increase in the supply 
of workers, due to both higher participation and a rebound of immigration to pre -
pandemic levels.
2  Many indicators suggest that, while conditions remain tight, the labor 
market is gradually cooling.  Job openings have moved well down from their highs and are now only modestly above pre -pandemic level s.  Quits are back to pre -pandemic 
levels, and the same is true of the wage premium earned by those who change jobs.
3  
Surveys of workers and employers show a return to pre -pandemic levels of tightness.4  
And indicators of wage growth show a gradual decl ine toward levels that would be 
consistent with 2 percent inflation over time.5     
 
2 The labor force participation rate has increased by about one-half percentage point since the end of last 
year.  
3 For example, according to the Atlanta Fed's Wage Growth Tracker, the median wage g rowth for job 
switchers is now only slightly higher than that of job stayers. The size of this gap is now similar to what 
was normal pre -pandemic after being elevated in recent years.  
4 A measure of job availability drawn from Conference Board data —showing  the difference between the 
share of consumers saying that jobs are plentiful and the share saying that jobs are hard to get —was 
elevated in 2021 –22 but is now below its 2019 average.  In data from the National Federation of 
Independent Businesses, the sha re of small business owners reporting difficulty filling job openings has 
likewise declined considerably in the last two years and is now only slightly above its 2019 average.  
5 One recent indicator, a verage hourly earnings , grew 0.2 percent in September, resulting in an annualized 
3-month growth rate of 3.4 percent and a 12 -month growth rate of 4.2 percent.   By comparison, 12- month 
average hourly earnings growth peaked at 5.9 percent in early 2022.   - 3 - 
Growth  
To date, declining inflation has not come at the cost of meaningfully higher 
unemployment —a highly welcome development, but a historically unusual one .  Healing 
of supply chains in conjunction with the rebalancing of demand and supply in the labor 
market has allowed disinflation without substantially weaker economic activity.  Indeed, economic growth has consistently surprised to the upside this year, as most recentl y seen 
in the strong retail sales data released earlier this week.  Forecasters generally expect gross domestic product to come in very strong for the third quarter before cooling off in the fourth quarter and next year.  Still, the record suggests that a sustainable return to our 2 percent inflation goal is likely to require a period of below -trend growth and some 
further softening in labor market conditions.
6   
 Geopolitical tensions are highly elevated and pose important risks to global 
economic activit y.  Our institutional role at the Federal Reserve is to monitor these 
developments for their economic implications, which remain highly uncertain.   Speaking for myself, I found the attack on Israel horrifying, as is the prospect for more loss of innocent lives.  
Monetary Policy  
Turning to monetary policy, the FOMC has tightened policy substantially over the 
past 18 months, increasing the federal funds rate by 525 basis points at a historically fast pace and decreasing our securities holdings by roughly $1 trillion.  The stance of  policy is 
 
6 For example , the October Blue Chip consensus estimate for annualized real gross domestic product 
(GDP) growth in the third quarter is 3.5 percent .  Some projections anticipate even stronger growth, such as 
GDPNow, which currently anticipates 5.4 percent annualized growth in the third quarter, additional 
information is available on the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s website at 
https://www.atlantafed.org/cqer/research/gdpnow .    The Bureau of Economic Analysis will release its 
advance estimate of third quarter real GDP on October 26.   - 4 - 
restrictive, meaning that tight policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity 
and inflation.  Given the fast pace of the tightening, there may still be meaningful tightening in the pipeline.   
My colleagues and I are committed to achi eving a stance of policy that is 
sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation sustainably down to 2 percent over time, and to keeping policy restrictive until we are confident that inflation is on a path to that objective.  We are attentive to recent data showing the resilience of economic growth and demand for labor .  Additional evidence of persistently above -trend growth, or that 
tightness in the labor market is no longer easing, could put further progress on inflation at risk and could warrant further tig htening of monetary policy.   
Along with many other factors, actual and expected changes in the stance of 
monetary policy affect broader financial conditions, which in turn affect economic activity, employment and inflation.  Financial conditions have tigh tened significantly in 
recent months, and longer -term bond yields have been an important driving factor in this 
tightening.  We remain attentive to these developments because persistent changes in financial conditions can have implications for the path of monetary policy.   Conclusion 
My colleagues and I remain resolute in our commitment to returning inflation to 2 
percent over time.  A range of uncertainties, both old and new, complicate our task of balancing the risk of tightening monetary policy too much against the risk of tightening too little.  Doing too little could allow above -target inflation to become entrenched and 
ultimately require monetary policy to wring more persistent inflation from the economy  - 5 - 
at a high cost to employment.  Doing too much c ould also do unnecessary harm to the 
economy.  
Given the uncertainties and risks, and how far we have come, the Committee is 
proceeding carefully.  We will make decisions about the extent of additional policy 
firming and how long policy will remain restric tive based on the totality of the incoming 
data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.   
Thank you.   I look forward to our conversation.

The Ten Suggestions  
  
 
Remarks by

at 
 
Baccalaureate Ceremony, Princeton University   
 
Princeton, New Jersey  
 
 
 
 
   
June 2, 2013  
  
It’s nice to be back at Princeton.  I find it difficult to believe that it’s been almost 
11 years since I departed these halls for Washington.  I wrote recently to inquire about 
the status of my leave from the university, and the le tter I got back began, “Reg rettably, 
Princeton receives many  more qualified applicants for faculty positions than we can 
accommodate.”1 
I’ll extend my best wishes to the seniors later, but first I want to congratulate the 
parents and families here.  As a p arent myself, I know that putting your kid through 
college these days is no walk in the park.  Some years ago I had a colleague who sent three kids through Princeton even though neither he nor his wife attended this university.  He and his spouse were very  proud of that accomplishment, as they should have been.  
But my colleague also used to say that, from a financial perspective, the experience was like buying a new Cadillac every year and then driving it off a cliff.   I should say that he 
always added that he would do it all over again in a minute.  So , well done, moms , dads , 
and families.  
This is indeed an impressive and appropriate setting for a commencement.  I am 
sure that, from this lectern, any number of distinguished spiritual leaders have ruminated on the lessons of the Ten Commandments.  I don’t have that kind of confidence, and, 
anyway, coveting your neighbor’s ox or donkey is not the problem it used to be, so I thought I would use my few minutes today to make Ten Suggestions, or maybe just Ten Observations, about the world and your lives after Princeton.  Please note, these points 
have nothing whatsoever to do with interest rates.  My qualification for making such suggestions, or observations, besides having kindly been invited to speak today by President Tilghman, is the same as the reason that your obnoxious brother or sister got to 
                                                 
1 Note to journalists:   This is a joke.  My leave from Princeton expired in 2005.   - 2 - 
go to bed later --I am older than you.  All of what follows has been road- tested in real -life 
situations , but past performance is no guarantee of future results.  
 
1. The poet Robert Burns once said something about the best -laid plans of mice 
and men ganging aft agley, whatever “agley” means.  A  more contemporary  
philosopher, Forrest Gump, said something similar about life and boxes of chocolates and not knowing what you a re going to get.  They were both right.  
Life is amazingly unpredictable; any 22 -year-old who thinks he or she  know s 
where they will be in 10 years, much less in 30, is simply lacking imagination.  Look what happened to me:  A dozen years ago I was minding  my own 
business teaching Economics 101 in Alexander Hall and trying to think of good excuses for avoiding faculty meetings.  Then I got a phone call  . . .   In 
case you are skeptical of Forrest Gump’s insight , here’s a concrete suggestion 
for each of the graduating seniors.  Take a few minutes the first chance you 
get and talk to an alum participating in his or her  25th, or 30th, or 40th 
reunion-- you know, somebody who was near the front of the P -rade.  Ask 
them , back when they were graduating 25, 30, or 4 0 years ago , where they 
expected to be today .  If you can get them to open up, they will tell you that 
today they are happy and satisfied in various measures, or not, and their personal stories will be filled with highs and lows and in- betweens.  But, I am  
willing to bet, those life stories will in almost all cases be quite different, in large and small ways, from what they expected when they started out.  This is  - 3 - 
a good thing, not a bad thing; who wants to know the end of a story that’s only 
in its early c hapters?  Don’t be afraid to let the drama play out.  
 
2. Does the fact that our lives are so influenced by chance and seemingly small decisions and actions mean that there is no point to planning, to striving?  Not at all.  Whatever life may have in store for  you, each of you has a grand, 
lifelong project, and that is the development  of yourself as a human being.  
Your family and friends and your time at Princeton have given you a good start.  What will you do with it?  Will you keep learning and thinking hard and 
critically about the most important questions?  Will you become an emotionally stronger person, more generous, more loving, more ethical?  Will you involve yourself actively and constructively in the world?  Many things will happen in your lives, plea sant and not so pleasant, but, paraphrasing a 
Woodrow Wilson School adage from the time I was here, “ Wherever you go, 
there you are.”  If you are not happy with yourself, even the loftiest achievements won’t bring you much satisfaction . 
 
3. The concept of suc cess leads me to consider so -called meritocracies and their 
implications.  We have been taught that meritocratic institutions and societies are fair.  Putting aside the reality that no system, including our own, is really entirely meritocratic, meritocraci es may be fairer and more efficient than 
some alternatives.  But fair in an absolute sense?  Think about it.  A meritocracy is a system in which the people who are the luckiest in their  - 4 - 
health and genetic endowment; luckiest in terms of family support, 
encouragement, and, probably, income; luckiest in their educational and 
career opportunities; and luckiest in so many other ways difficult to enumerate --these are the folks who reap the largest rewards.  The only way for 
even a putative meritocracy to hope to pass ethical muster, to be considered fair, is if those who are the luckiest in all of those respects also have the greatest responsibility to work hard, to contribute to the betterment of the world, and to share their luck with others.  As the Gospel of Luke says (and I 
am sure my rabbi will forgive me for quoting the New Testament in  a good 
cause):  “From everyone to whom much has been given, much will be required; and from the one to whom much has been entrusted, even more will be demanded” ( Luke 12:48, New Revised Standard Version Bible ).  Kind of 
grading on the curve, you might say.  
 
4. Who is worthy of admiration?  Luke’s admonition--which is shared by most ethical and philosophical traditions, by the way --helps with this question as 
well.  Those most worthy of admiration are those who have made the best use of their advantages or, alternatively, coped most courageously with their adversities.  I  think most of us would agree  that people who have, say, little 
formal schooling but labor honestly and dilig ently to help feed, clothe, and 
educate their families are deserving of greater respect --and help, if necessary --
than many people who are s uperficially  more successful.  They’re m ore fun to 
have a beer with , too.  That is all you need to know about sociology.   - 5 - 
 
5. Since I have covered sociology , I might as well cover political science as well .  
In regard to politics, I have always liked Lily Tomlin’s line, in paraphrase:  “I 
try to be cynical , but I just can’t keep up.”  We all feel that way some time .  
Actuall y, having been in Washington now for almost 11 years, as I mentioned, 
I feel that way quite a bit.  Ultimately, though, cynicism is a poor substitute for critical thought and constructive action.  Sure, interests  and money and 
ideology  all matter, as you l earned in political science.  But my experience is 
that most of our politicians and policymakers are trying to do the right thing, 
according to their own consciences , most of the time.  If you think that the bad 
or indifferent results that too often come out of Washington are due to base motives and bad intentions , you are giving politicians and policymakers way 
too much credit for being effective.  Honest error in the face of complex and 
possibly intractable problems is a far more important source of bad r esults 
than are bad motives .  For these reasons , the greatest forces in Washington are 
ideas, and people prepared to act on those ideas.  Public service isn’t easy.  But, in the end, if you are inclined in that direction, it is a worthy and 
challenging pur suit. 
 
6. Having given you the essence of sociology and political science, l et me wrap 
up economics while I’m at it.  Economics is a highly sophisticated field of thought that is superb at explaining to policymakers precisely why the choices they made in the past were wrong.  About the future, not so much.  However,  - 6 - 
careful economic analysis does have one important benefit, which is that it 
can help kill ideas that are completely logically inconsistent or wildly at variance with  the data.  This insight covers at least 90 percent of proposed 
economic policies.  
 
7. I’m not going to tell you that money doesn’t matter, because you wouldn’t 
believe me anyway.  In fact, for too many people around the world, money is literally a life -or-death proposition.  But if you are  part of the lucky minority 
with the ability to choose, remember that money is a means, not an end.  A career decision based only on money and not on love of the work or a desire to make a difference is a recipe for unhappiness.   
 
8. Nobody likes to fail but failure is an essential part of life and of learning.  If 
your uniform isn’t dirty, you haven’t been in the game.  
 
9. I spoke earlier about definitions of personal success in an unpredictable world.  I hope that as you develop your own definition of success, you will be able to 
do so, if you wish, with a close companion on your journey.  In making that choice, remember that physical beauty is evolution’s way of assuring us that the other person doesn’t have too many intestinal parasites.  Don’t get me wrong, I  am all for beauty, romance, and sexual attraction --where would 
Hollywood and Madison Avenue be without them?  But while important, those are not the only things to look for in a partner.  The two of you will have a long trip together, I hope, and you will  need each other’s support and  - 7 - 
sympathy more times than you can count.  Speaking as somebody who has 
been happily married for 35 years, I can’t imagine any choice more consequential for a lifelong journey than the choice of a traveling companion. 
 
 10.  Call your mom and dad once in a while.  A time will come when you will 
want your own grown -up, busy, hyper -successful children to call you.  Also, 
remember  who paid your tuition to Princeton.  
 
Those are my suggestions.   They’re  probably  worth exactly what  you paid for 
them.  But they come from someone who shares your affection for this great institution and who wishes you the best for the future.  
Congratulations, graduates.  Gi ve ’em hell.

U.S. Monetary Policy and In ternational Implications 
 
  
Remarks by 
 
Ben S. Bernanke 
 
Chairman 
 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
 
at 
 
“Challenges of the Global Financial System: 
Risks and Governance unde r Evolving Globalization” 
 
A High-Level Seminar sponsored by 
Bank of Japan-International Monetary Fund 
  
Tokyo, Japan 
       
October 14, 2012 
 
  
Thank you.  It is a pleasure to be here.  Th is morning I will first briefly review the 
U.S. and global economic outlook.  I will then discuss the basic rationale underlying the 
Federal Reserve’s recent policy decisions a nd place these actions in  an international 
context. 
U.S. and Global Outlook 
The U.S. economy has faced significant headwinds, and, although the economy 
has been expanding since mid-2009, the pace of our recovery has been frustratingly slow.  
The headwinds include the effects of dele veraging by households, the still-weak U.S. 
housing market, tight credit conditions in some sectors, spillovers from the situation in 
Europe, fiscal contraction at all levels of  government, and concerns about the medium-
term U.S. fiscal outlook.  In this environmen t, households and businesses have been quite 
cautious in increasing spending.  Accordingl y, the pace of economic growth has been 
insufficient to support significant improve ment in the job market; indeed, the 
unemployment rate, at 7.8 percen t, is well above what we judge to be its long-run normal 
level.  With large and persistent margins of  resource slack, U.S. in flation has generally 
been subdued despite periodic fluctuations in commodity prices.  Consumer price 
inflation is running somewhat below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent longer-run 
objective, and survey- and mark et-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations 
have remained well anchored. 
The global economic outlook also presents  many challenges, as you know.  Fiscal 
and financial strains have pushed Europe b ack into recession.  Japan’s economy is 
recovering from last year’s tragic earthquake  and tsunami, and it continues to struggle 
with deflation and persistent weak demand.  And in the emerging market economies, the  - 2 -
rapid snap-back from the global financial cris is has given way to slower growth in the 
face of weak export demand from the advanced economies.  The soft tone of global 
activity is yet another head wind for the U.S. economy.  
Looking ahead, economic projections of  Federal Open Market Committee 
(FOMC) participants prepared for the Co mmittee’s September meeting called for the 
economic recovery to proceed at a modera te pace in coming quarters, with the 
unemployment rate declining only gradually.  FO MC participants gene rally expected that 
inflation was likely to run at  or below the Committee’s infl ation goal of 2 percent over 
the next few years.  The Committee also j udged that there were  significant downside 
risks to this outlook, importantly  including the potentia l for an intensification of strains in 
Europe and an associated sl owing in global growth.   
Federal Reserve’s Recent Policy Actions  
All of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions are guided by our dual 
mandate to promote maximum employment a nd stable prices.  With the disappointing 
progress in job markets and with inflation pressures re maining subdued, the FOMC has 
taken several important steps this year to  provide additional policy accommodation.  In 
January, the Committee noted that  it anticipated that economic  conditions were likely to 
warrant exceptionally low leve ls of the federal funds rate  at least through late 2014--a 
year and a half later than in  previous statements.  In June, policymakers decided to 
continue through year-end the maturity ex tension program (MEP), under which the 
Federal Reserve purchases long-term Treasury se curities and sells short-term ones to help 
depress long-term yields.    - 3 -
At its September meeting, with the data continuing to signal weak labor markets 
and no signs of significant in flation pressures, the FOMC  decided to take several 
additional steps to provide po licy accommodation.  It extend ed the period over which it 
expects to maintain exceptiona lly low levels of the federal funds rate from late 2014 to 
mid-2015.  Moreover, the Committee clarified that it expects to maintain a highly 
accommodative stance of monetary policy for a considerable peri od after the economic 
recovery strengthens.  The FOMC coupled these changes in forward guidance with 
additional asset purchases, announcing that it will purchase agency mortgage-backed 
securities (MBS) at a pace of $40 billion pe r month, on top of the $45 billion in monthly 
purchases of long-term Treasury securities pl anned for the remainder of this year under 
the MEP.  The FOMC also indicated that it would continue to purchase agency MBS, 
undertake additional asset purchases, and empl oy other tools as appropriate until the 
outlook for the labor market improves substan tially in a context of price stability.   
The open-ended nature of these new asset purchases, together with their explicit 
conditioning on improvements in labor mark et conditions, will provide the Committee 
with flexibility in responding to economi c developments and instill greater public 
confidence that the Federal Reserve will take the actions necessary to foster a stronger 
economic recovery in a context of price stab ility.  An easing in financial conditions and 
greater public confidence should help promot e more rapid economic growth and faster 
job gains over coming quarters. 
As I have said many times, however, m onetary policy is not a panacea.  Although 
we expect our policies to provide meaningful  help to the economy, the most effective 
approach would combine a range of economic policies and tackle longer-term fiscal and  - 4 -
structural issues as well as the near-term shortfall in aggregate demand.  Moreover, we 
recognize that unconventional m onetary policies come with possible risks and costs; 
accordingly, the Federal Reserve has genera lly employed a high hurdle for using these 
tools and carefully weighs the costs and benefits of any proposed policy action. 
International Aspects of Federal Reserve Asset Purchases 
  Although the monetary accommodation we are providing is playing a critical role 
in supporting the U.S. economy, concerns have been raised about the spillover effects of 
our policies on our trading partners .  In particular, some critics  have argued that the Fed’s 
asset purchases, and accommodative monetary  policy more generally, encourage capital 
flows to emerging market economies.  These capital flows are said  to cause undesirable 
currency appreciation, too much  liquidity leading to asse t bubbles or inflation, or 
economic disruptions as capital inflows qui ckly give way to outflows.      
 I am sympathetic to the challenges faced by many economies in a world of 
volatile international capital flows.  And, to be sure , highly accommodative monetary 
policies in the United States, as well as in ot her advanced economies, shift interest rate 
differentials in favor of emerging markets a nd thus probably contribut e to private capital 
flows to these markets.  I would argue, though, that it is not at all clear that 
accommodative policies in advanced economies impose net costs on emerging market economies, for several reasons. 
First, the linkage between advanced-econom y monetary policies  and international 
capital flows is looser than is sometimes asse rted.  Even in normal times, differences in 
growth prospects among countries--and the result ing differences in expected returns--are 
the most important determinant of capita l flows.  The rebound in emerging market  - 5 -
economies from the global financial crisis, ev en as the advanced economies remained 
weak, provided still greater encouragemen t to these flows.  Another important 
determinant of capital flows is the appetite for risk by global investors.   Over the past few 
years, swings in investor sentiment between “risk-on” and “risk-off,” often in response to 
developments in Europe, have led to corres ponding swings in capital  flows.  All told, 
recent research, including studies by the In ternational Monetary Fund, does not support 
the view that advanced-ec onomy monetary policies are th e dominant factor behind 
emerging market capital flows.1  Consistent with such findings, these flows have 
diminished in the past couple of years or so, even as monetary policies in advanced 
economies have continued to eas e and longer-term interest ra tes in those economies have 
continued to decline. 
Second, the effects of capital inflows, what ever their cause, on emerging market 
economies are not predetermined, but instea d depend greatly on the choices made by 
policymakers in those economies.  In some emerging markets, policymakers have chosen 
to systematically resist currency apprecia tion as a means of promoting exports and 
domestic growth.  However, the perceived be nefits of currency management inevitably 
come with costs, including reduced mone tary independence and the consequent 
susceptibility to imported inflation.  In ot her words, the perceived advantages of 
undervaluation and the problem of unwanted  capital inflows must be understood as a 
package--you can’t have one without the other.

Of course, an alternative strategy--one c onsistent with classi cal principles of 
international adjustment--is to refrain from  intervening in foreign exchange markets, 
thereby allowing the currency to rise and he lping insulate the financial system from 
external pressures.  Under a flexible excha nge-rate regime, a fully independent monetary 
policy, together with fiscal policy as neede d, would be available to help counteract any 
adverse effects of currency appreciation on growth.  The resultant rebalancing from 
external to domestic demand would not only preserve near-term growth in the emerging 
market economies while supporting recovery  in the advanced economies, it would 
redound to everyone’s benefit in the long r un by putting the global economy on a more 
stable and sustainable path.     Finally, any costs for emerging market ec onomies of monetary easing in advanced 
economies should be set against the very real be nefits of those policie s.  The slowing of 
growth in the emerging market economies this year in large part reflects their 
decelerating exports to the United States, Europe, and other advanced economies.  
Therefore, monetary easing that  supports the recovery in the advanced economies should 
stimulate trade and boost growth in emerging market economies as well.  In principle, 
depreciation of the dollar a nd other advanced-economy cu rrencies could reduce (although 
not eliminate) the positive effect on trade a nd growth in emerging markets.  However, 
since mid-2008, in fact, before th e intensification of the fina ncial crisis triggered wide 
swings in the dollar, the real multilateral va lue of the dollar has ch anged little, and it has 
fallen just a bit against the currencies of the emerging market economies.

Conclusion   
To conclude, the Federal Reserve is providing additional monetary 
accommodation to achieve its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability.  
This policy not only helps strengthen the U. S. economic recovery, but by boosting U.S. 
spending and growth, it has the effect of he lping support the global economy as well.  
Assessments of the international impact of U.S. monetary po licies should give 
appropriate weight to thei r beneficial effects on gl obal growth and stability.

My Perspective on Bank Regulation and Supervision 
 
  
Remarks by 
 
Michelle W. Bowman  
 
Member  
 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  
 
at the  
 
Conference for Community Bankers  
sponsored by  
The American Bankers Association  
 
Virtual conference
 
       
February 16, 2021 Good morning.  I want to thank the Ame rican Bankers Association for 
inviting me to speak to  you today.  T wo years ago, I gave my first speech as a Federal 
Reserve governor at this  conference in San Diego, and it is always great to be with you—
even if remotely from our recording studio at the Board. 
It’s fair to say tha t a lot has happened over the past two years.  It is an 
understatement to say that the COVID -19 pandemic has created significant challenges 
inside and outside the banking sector.  Bankers significantly adapted operations to 
continue serving their communiti es and customers.  You overcame staffing challenges 
and other hurdles, kept the virtual doors open, worked with your customers, and provided assistance to workers and businesses through the Paycheck Protection Program.   Those 
efforts have made, and continue to make, a huge difference in the lives of many people affected by the pandemic, and I thank you.  
Since  becoming a member of the Federal Reserve Board , I have made it a priority 
to enhance the Federal Reserve’s dialogue with community bankers .  I have embarked on 
an effort t o meet with the leaders of every community bank and regional bank supervised 
by the Federal Reserve.  This valuable interaction  helps build an understanding of issues 
affecting  small and regional banks , support  supervisory decision -making, and shape some 
of my perspective .  It has also  helpe d the Federal Reserve identify initiatives to support 
the vital role of community banks in servi ng the financial needs of  communities .   
Today, I would like  to share my approach to supervision and regulation, which 
has helped guide  the Fed’s efforts to improve oversight of community banks over the past 
few years and shaped our priorities for 2021 and beyond.  In most cases, my points about banking regulation als o apply to supervision.  I will then focus on several Federal - 2- 
 
 
 Reserve initiatives that are underway to support community banks during the pandemic 
and into the future.  
The first principle is fundamental to regulation  but sometimes bears repeating —
regulation should always strike the right balance .  For banking regulation, that means a 
balance between actions that promote safety and  soundness and  actions that promote an 
acceptable and manageable level of risk -taking.  The challenge is doing neither too little 
to be effective to achieve the public benefit of government oversight , nor too much to 
prevent the regulated businesses from meeting their customers ’ needs .  Some  regulation 
is appropriate and necessary but striking the right balance means that at some point regulation can go too far and end up reducing the public’s welfare.  In recent years, t he 
Federal Reserve and other agencies have made oversight more effective by  better 
differentiating prudential regulat ion and supervision based on the  asset size  of banks , the 
complexity of their activities, and the related risks  they pose to the financial system .  This 
is especially important  for community banks, most of which managed risks well before 
and during the 2008 financial crisis and have managed their risks well since.  Achieving 
these principles also requires following  consumer protection laws and regulations, 
including fair lending laws, to ensure fairness and broad access to credit and financial services that enable economic opportunity for individuals and communities.   The second principle is that the regulat ory framework should be effective, but 
also efficient, and that means assessing the impact  of the requirements .  For the Federal 
Reserve, it  means that we consider both a rule’s benefit to safety and soundness and any 
potential negative effect , including limiting the availability of credit and services to the 
public , and the implications of compliance costs on banks.  The  wisdom in this approach - 3- 
 
 
 is evident when considering the e ffect of a regulation on community bank s and the ir role 
in providing financial services to their communities .  Community banks have often been 
one of the few or only sources of credit and financial services to  their customers.   Their 
smaller operational scale relies on fewer staff to reach a more disbursed customer base 
with limited resources for compliance activities.   Regulations should consider the 
potential impact on the availability of services in a commun ity, as well as the costs to the 
bank of implementing a rule, particularly in more rural locations.  It is necessary that a full and careful practical analysis of costs and benefits be a part of every rulemaking.  
 The third principle is  that regulation and supervision should be consistent, 
transparent , and fair .  Reg ulators are obligat ed by law to act in this manner , and it also 
makes good practical sense.  T hese principles enhance safety and soundness and 
consumer  compliance by making sure supervisory expectations are clear and that banks 
understand and respect the regulatory requirements .  Supervisors should not and cannot 
be everywhere at every moment.  But they should be available to provide clarification or answer questions when needed.  A clear understanding of the rules and our expectations and a respect for the reasonable  application of them  is an effective approach to ensure 
effective compliance.  By promoting respect and trust between regulators and the 
supervised institution, banks a re more likely to communicate throughout the examination 
cycle to inform supervisors of changes they may be considering or challenges they may be facing and how best to resolve or approach them from a regulatory perspective.  
 A final principle that flows f rom consistency, transparency , and fairness is that 
rules and supervisory judgments must  have a legitimate prudential purpose, and in the 
majority of cases must n ot be solely punitive.  The goal should be to encourage  sound - 4- 
 
 
 business practices and activities by supervised institutions .  By clearly communicating 
our objectives , we build respect for the rules and make it more likely that any remedial 
actions against an institut ion will not  be necessary  because we encourage compliance 
through our super visory  approach.  When a supervisory action or formal enforcement 
action is required to addre ss violations at an institution, those actions should be framed in 
a way that seeks to promote safe, sound, and fair  practices and not simply as punishment.  
 These principles that guide my approach to regulation and supervision are 
consistent with many of the major steps that the Federal Reserve has taken to improve 
community bank oversight since the implementation of the rules following the 2008 
financial crisis.  Some  predate my arrival at the Fed, and some I have played a significant 
role in achieving.  Most of these actions  involve tailoring rules that treated community 
banks in the same way as larger, more complex institutions.  For example, the Volcker 
rule was aimed at curb ing proprietary trading by large banks , but it ended up creating 
significant compliance costs for community banks , which are  not involved in this type of 
trading .     
Many of the most important improvements to the Federal Reserve’s regulatory 
framework  involve tailoring rules to fit to the size, business model , and risk profiles of 
community banks.  For example, we raised  the asset threshold for small banks t o qualify 
for an  18-month exam cycle  and similarly raised the threshold for small bank holding 
companies to be exempted from consolidated risk- based capital rules.  The  concept of 
tailoring is also expressed  in our community bank supervis ory framework , which ha s 
been updated to implement  the Bank Exams Tailored to Risk (BETR) program .  The 
BETR program allow s examiners to identif y higher and lower risk activities  and, in turn, - 5- 
 
 
 streamline the examination process for lower risk community banks , thereby reducing 
burden.  In fact, Federal Reserve examiners have tailored examination s by spending 
approximately 65 percent less time on low/moderate risk state member bank exams than 
they do on high- risk exams.   We also implemented the community bank leverage ratio 
that allow s institutions to opt out of risk -based capital requirements.  T he Federal Reserve 
and the other agencies also raised the threshold for when an appraisal is required for residential real estate loans and tailored safety -and-soundness examinations of 
community and regional state member banks to reflect the levels of risk present and minimize regulatory burden for banks . 
 These improvements in regulation and supervision have helped right  the balance I 
spoke of earlier between safety and soundness  and consumer protection, on the one hand, 
and the ability to provide financial services and best meet the needs of their customers.  
We have also considered the impact of our actions , seeking to revise rules tha t impose 
significant costs to community banks but provide  limited  benefit  to safety and soundness , 
consumer protection, or financial stability .   
 As a part of this approach, I have also prioritized efforts to improve the 
consistency, transparency , and reasonableness of regulation and supervision.  One of 
those efforts  is promoting greater consistency in  supervisory practices across the Federal 
Reserve System .  For example, w e are actively working to improve the timelines s of 
providing banks with consumer compliance exam findings .  Further, w e are exploring 
ways to strengthen our ability to understand, monitor, and analyze the risks  that are 
affecting community banks.   A key aspect  of consistency is ensuring the same 
supervisory approach and outcomes for similarly situated institutions , with the goal of - 6- 
 
 
 ensuring, for exampl e, that a “one ” composite or component  rating in a particular region 
would be the same for an institution with similar activities and practices in another  
region.  This applies to all areas of our supervisory responsibility, whether safety and 
soundness, consumer compliance , or analyses of financial stability risk.  
I’d like to expand on one important area of focus, which is essential to the future 
success of the community banking sector : accessible i nnovation and technology 
integration .  This subject is on e that I speak about frequently with stakeholders and our 
staff at the Board.  We are committed to developing a range of tools that will creat e 
pathways for banks to develop and pursue potential partnerships with fintech companies .  
This includes clearer guidance on third- party risk management, a guide on sound due 
diligence practices, and a paper on fintech -community bank partnerships and related 
considerations.  Th ese tools will serve as a resource for  banks looking to innovate 
through fintech partnershi ps.  
Technological  developments and financial market evolution are quickly escalating 
competition  in the banking industry, and our approach to analyzing the competitive 
effects of  merger s and acquisitions  need s to keep pace.  The  Board’s framework for 
banking antitrust analysis hasn’t  changed substantially over the past couple of decades.  I 
believe we should consider revisions to that framework  that would better reflect the 
competition that smaller  banks face in  an industry quickly being transformed  by 
technology and non- bank financial companies .  As part of this effort, we have engaged in 
conversations and received feedback from community banks  about the Board’s 
competitive analysis framework and its impact on their  business strategies and long -term 
growth plans .  We are in the process of reviewing our approach, and we are specifically - 7- 
 
 
 considering the unique market dynamics faced by small community bank s in rural and 
underserved areas.  
 Soon a fter the pandemic began early last year, the Fed eral Reserv e took several 
actions to support community banks and their ability to help affected customers.  We 
paused examinations and issued supervisory guidance that made it clear that we would 
not criticize or take public enforcement actions against a bank that was taking prudent steps to help customers and mak ing good faith efforts to comply with regulations .  This 
certainty of regulatory treatment created an environment that built trust between 
regulators and bankers.  It enabled banks to continue to meet the needs of their customers who were struggling with circumstances through no fault of their own.   
Let me conclude by again commending the important role that community banks 
have played in providing financial services during these challenging times.  You  
responded quickly to the needs of your customers and communities to provide financial 
services with limited , if any, interruption.  You persevered to implement the largest 
proportion of Paycheck Protection Program funds to small businesses, whether they were your existing customers or  new customers.  These relationships are the hallmark of 
community banking, and a s we look toward  the future , community banks will continue to 
play an essential role in supporting customers , delivering financial services , and 
providing resources to their communities and customers.     Let me stop here  and thank the organizers for another opportunity to speak to you 
at this important conference.  I loo k forward to your questions, Rob.

The Federal Reserve:   Looking Back, Looking Forward  
   
Remarks by  
 
Ben S. Bernanke

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  
 
at 
 
Annual Meeting of the American Economic Association  
 
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

In less than a month my term as Fed Chairman will end.  Needless to say, my 
tenure has been eventful --for the Federal Reserve, for the country, and for me personally.  
I thought it appropriate today to reflect on some accomplishments of the past eight years, 
as well as some uncompleted tasks.  I  will briefly cover three areas in my remarks :  
(1) the Federal Reserve’s  commitment to transparency and accountabi lity, (2) financial 
stability  and financial reform , and (3) monetary policy.  I  will close by discussing the 
prospects for the U.S. and global economies.  
Transparency and Accountability  
Fostering transparency and accountability at the Federal Reserve was one of my 
principal objectives when I became Chairman in February 2006.  I had long advocated increased transparency and, in particular, a more explicit policy framework as ways to make monetary policy more predictable and more effective.  Our efforts to e nhance 
transparency and communication have indeed made monetary policy more effective, but, as I’ll discuss, these steps have proved important in other spheres as well.  
When I began my term I expected to build on the monetary policy framework I 
had inherit ed from  Paul Volcker and Alan Greenspan.  My predecessors had solidified 
the Fed’s commitment to low and stable inflation  as a foundation of broader economic 
stability,  and they  gradually increased the transparency of monetary policy  deliberations 
and plans .  For example, Chairman Volcker introduced a money -targeting framework to 
help guide the Fed’s attack on high inflation in the early 1980s, and the practice of issuing a statement after each meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) began under  Chairman Greenspan.  I believed  that a still more transparent approach 
would make monetary policy even more effective and further strengthen the Fed’s  - 2 - 
institutional credibility.   In particular, as an academic I had written favorably about the 
flexible inf lation -targeting  approach used by the Bank of England and a number of other 
central banks.  By making public considerable information about policy goals and 
strategies, together with their economic forecasts, these central banks  provided a clear 
framework to help the public and market participants understand and anticipate policy actions.  The provision of numerical goals and policy plans also helped make these central banks more accountable for achieving their stated objectives.  I was confident that we co uld adapt this type of framework to the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate to promote 
both maximum employment and price stability.  Indeed, central banks using this framework were already, in practice, often pursuing economic objectives in addition to low and stable inflation --hence the term, “flexible” inflation targeting.  
Because the financial crisis and its aftermath naturally occupied so much of 
policymakers’ attention, progress toward a more explicit policy framework at the Federal 
Reserve was slower than  I had hoped.  Nevertheless, progress was made.  In the minutes 
of its October 2007 meeting , the FOMC introduced its quarterly Summary of Economic 
Projections (SEP), which included FOMC participants’ projections of key macroeconomic variables such as infla tion, gross domestic product (GDP) growth, and 
the unemployment rate.
1  Over time, we added long -run projections of inflation, growth, 
                                                 
1 Prior to October 2007, FOMC participants provided semiannual projections of nominal and real GDP, 
unemployment, and core inflation, which were reported in the meeting minutes and in the Monetary Policy 
Report to the Congress .  The innovations associated with the introduction of the SEP  included (1) the 
switch from semiannual to quarterly frequency, (2) the addition of projections for overall inflation 
(projections of nominal GDP growth were dropped), (3)  the extension by two years of the projection 
horizon, (4) the inclusion of participants’ views about the risks to and the uncertainty surrounding the outlook for each projected variable, (5) the inclusion of the full distribution of participants’ projections, not just the range and central tendency, and 6) a write -up of the rationales provided by participants for their 
projections.   As noted in the text, further innovations, including interest rate projections and long- run 
projections of economic growth, u nemployment, inflation, and the federal funds rate were added over 
time.   The role of the projections in policy communication was also significantly increased after October  - 3 - 
and unemployment, as well as projections of the path of the target federal funds rate 
consistent with each individual’s views of appropriate monetary policy.  These additions have better informed the public about participants’ views on both the long -run objectives 
of policy and the path of interest rates most consistent with achieving those objectives.   
We took another important step in January 2012, when the FOMC issued a 
statement laying out its longer -run goals and policy strategy.
2  The statement established, 
for the first time, an explicit longer -run goal for inflation of 2 percent, and it pointed to 
the SEP to provide information about Committee participants’ assessments of the longer -
run normal unemployment rate, currently between 5.2 and 6 percent.  The statement also indicated that the Committee would take a balanced approach to its price stability and employment obj ectives.  We adopted additional measures aimed at clarifying the 
rationales for our decisions, including my quarterly postmeeting  press conference.  T he 
increases in policy transparency that were achieved proved valuable during a very difficult period for monetary policy.  
As it happened, during the crisis and its aftermath the Federal Reserve’s 
transparency and accountability proved critical in a quite different sphere --namely, in 
supporting the institution’s democratic legitimacy.  The Federal Reserve, lik e other 
central banks, wields powerful tools; democratic accountability requires that the public be able to see how and for what purposes those tools are being used.  Transparency is particularly important in a period like the recent one in which the Feder al Reserve has 
been compelled to take unusual and dramatic actions --including the provision of liquidity 
                                                                                                                                                 
2007; for example, they were regularly referenced in the Chairman’s semiannual Hump hrey-Hawkins 
testimony before the Congress (see Board of Governors, 2007a, 2007b) . 
2 See Board of Governors (2012b).   - 4 - 
to a wide range of financial institutions and markets that did not normally have access to 
the Fed’s discount window --to help stabilize the financial s ystem and the economy.  
What types of transparency are needed to preserve public confidence?  At the 
most basic level, a central bank must be clear and open about its actions and operations, particular ly when they involve the deployment of public funds.  The Federal Reserve 
routinely makes public extensive information on all aspects of its activities, and since the crisis it has greatly increased the quantity and detail of its regular reports to the Congress and the public.
3  Importantly, contrary to what is sometimes asserted, all of the Fed’s 
financial transactions and operations are subject to regular, intensive audits --by the 
Government Accountability Office, an independent Inspector General, and a private accounting firm, as well as by our own internal  auditors.
4  It is a testament to the 
dedication of the Federal Reserve’s management team that these thorough audits have 
consistently  produced assessments of the Fed’s accounting and financial controls that 
most public companies  would envy . 
                                                 
3 For example, the Board has regularly published detailed information about the Federal Reserve’s balance 
sheet and the special liquidity facilities that were introduced during the crisis.  We created a section on our 
website devoted to these issues and initiated a regular public report as well.  (See the webpage “Credit and 
Liquidity Programs and the Balance Sheet ” at www.federalreserve.gov /monetarypolicy/bst.htm.)  
4 While the Government Accountability Office ( GAO)  has access to all aspects of the Fed’s operations and 
is free to criticize or make recommendations, there is one important exception:  monetary policymaking.   In 
the 1970s, the Congress deliberately excluded monetary policy deliberations, decisions, and actions from 
the scope of GAO reviews.   In doing so, the Congress carefully balanced the need for democratic 
accountability with the benefits that flow from keeping monetary policy free from short -term political 
pressures.  
However, there have been recent proposals (so -called Audit the Fed measures) to expand the 
authority of the GAO over the Federal Reserve to include reviews of monetary policy decisions.   Because 
the GAO is the inve stigative arm of the Congress and GAO reviews may be initiated at the request of 
members of the Congress, these reviews (or the prospect of reviews) of individual policy decisions could be 
seen, with good reason, as efforts to bring political pressure to bear on monetary policymakers.   A 
perceived politicization of monetary policy would reduce public confidence in the ability of the Federal 
Reserve to make its policy decisions based strictly on what is good for the economy in the longer 
term.   Balancing the  need for accountability against the goal of insulating monetary policy from short -term 
political pressures is very important, and I believe that the Congress had it right in the 1970s when it 
explicitly chose to protect monetary policy decisionmaking from  the possibility of politically motivated 
reviews.  
  - 5 - 
Transparency and accountability are about more than just opening up the books, 
however; they also require thoughtful explanations of what we are doing and why.  In this 
regard, our first responsibility is to the Congress, which established the Federal Reserve almost exa ctly a century ago and determine d its structure, objectives, and powers.  
Federal Reserve Board members, including the Chairman , of course, as well as senior 
staff, testify frequently before congressional committees on a wide range of topics.  When I becam e Chairman, I anticipated the obligation to appear regularly before the 
Congress.  I had not entirely anticipated, though, that I would spend so much time  
meeting with legislators outside of hearings --individually and in groups.  But I quickly 
came to real ize the importance of these relationships with legislators in keeping open the 
channels of communication.  As part of the Fed’s interaction with the Congress , we have 
also routinely provided staff briefings on request and conducted programs at the Board for the benefit of congressional staff interested in Federal Reserve issues.  I likewise 
maintained regular contact with both the Bush and Obama A dministrations , principally 
through meetings with the Secretary of the Treasury and other economic officials. 
The crisis and its aftermath , however, raised the need for communication and 
explanation by the Federal Reserve to a new level.  We took extraordinary measures to meet extraordinary economic challenges, and we had to explain those measures to earn the public ’s support and confidence.  Talking only to the Congress and to market 
participants would not have been enough.  The effort to inform the public engaged the whole institution, including both Board members and the staff.  As Chairman, I did my part, by appe aring on television programs, holding town halls, taking student questions at 
universities, and visiting a military base to talk to soldiers and their families.  The Federal  - 6 - 
Reserve Banks also played key roles in providing public information in their Distr icts, 
through programs, publications, speeches, and other media.  
The crisis has passed, but I think the Fed’s need to educate and explain will only 
grow.  When Paul Volcker first sat in the Chairman’s office in 1979, there were no 
financial news channels on cable TV, no Bloomberg screens, no blogs, no Twitter.  Today, news, ideas, and rumors circulate almost instantaneously.  The Fed must continue to find ways to navigate this changing environment while providing clear, objective, and reliable information to the public. 
Financial Stability  
For the U.S. and global economies, the most important event of the past eight 
years was, of course, the global financial crisis and the deep recession that it triggered.  
As I have observed on other occasions, the crisis  bore a strong family resemblance to a 
classic financial panic, except that it took place in the complex environment of the 21st 
century global financial system.
5  Likewise, the tools used to fight the panic, though 
adapted to the modern context, were anal ogous to those that would have been used a 
century ago, including liquidity provision by the central bank, liability guarantees , 
recapitalization , and the provision of assurances and information to the public. 
The immediate trigger of the crisis, as you know, was a sharp decline in house 
prices, which reversed a previous run- up that had been fueled by irresponsible mortgage 
lending and securitization practices.  Policymakers at the time, including myself, certainly appreciated that house prices might declin e, although we disagreed about how 
much decline was likely; indeed, prices were already moving down when I took office in 2006.  However, to a significant extent, our expectations about the possible 
                                                 
5 For more on the recent financial crisis as a classic financial panic, see Bernanke (2013).   - 7 - 
macroeconomic effects of house price declines were shaped  by the apparent analogy to 
the bursting of the dot -com bubble a few years earlier.  That earlier bust also involved a 
large reduction in paper wealth but was followed by only a mild recession.  In the event, 
of course, the  bursting of the housing bubble helped trigger  the most severe financial 
crisis since the Great Depression .  It did so because, unlike the earlier decline in equity 
prices,  it interacted with critical vulnerabilities  in the financial system and in government 
regulation that  allowed what w ere initially  moderate  aggregate  losses to  subprime 
mortgage holders to cascade through the financial system.  In the private sector, key vulnerabilities included high levels of leverage , excessive dependence on unstable short -
term funding , deficiencies in risk measurement and management , and the use of exotic 
financial instruments  that redistributed risk in nontransparent ways .  In the public sector, 
vulnerabilities included gaps in the regulatory structure that allowed some systemically important firms and markets to escape comprehensive supervision, failures of supervisors 
to effectively use their existing powers , and insufficient attention to threats to the stability 
of the system as a whole.   
The Federal Reserve responded forcefully to t he liquidity pressures during the 
crisis in a manner consistent with the lessons that central banks had learned from 
financial panics over more than 150 years and summarized in the writings of the 19th century British journalist Walter Bagehot:  Lend early  and freely to solvent institutions.
6  
However, the institutional context had changed substantially since Bagehot wrote.  The panics of the 19th  and early 20th  centur ies typically involved runs on commercial banks 
and other  depository institutions.  Prior to the recent crisis, in contrast, credit extension 
                                                 
6 As noted in Lombard Street , by Bagehot ([1873] 1897).  For a more extensive  discussion of the manner in 
which the Federal Reserve’s actions during the crisis followed traditional prescriptions regarding the proper 
response to liquidity strains, see Madigan (2009).   - 8 - 
had progressively migrated outside of traditional banking to so- called shadow banking 
entities, which relied heavily on short -term wholesale funding that proved vulnerable to 
runs.7  Accordingly, to help calm the panic, the Federal Reserve provided liquidity not 
only to commercial banks , but also to other types of financial  institutions such as 
investment banks  and money market funds, as well as  to key financial markets such as 
those for commercial paper and asset -backed securities.8  Because funding markets are 
global in scope  and U.S. borrowers depend importantly on foreign lenders , the Federal 
Reserve also approved currency swap agreements with 14 foreign central banks. 
Providing l iquidity represented only the first step in stabilizing the financial 
system.  Subsequent efforts focused on rebuilding the public’s confidence , notably 
including public guarantees of bank debt by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
and of money market funds by the Treas ury Department , as well as the injection of public 
capital into banking institutions.  The  bank stress test  that the Federal Reserve led in the 
spring of 2009, which included detailed public disclosure of information regarding the solvency of our largest b anks, further buttressed confidence in the banking system.  The 
success of the stress -test disclosures, by the way, was yet another example of the benefits 
of transparency.  
                                                 
7 Shadow banking, as usually defined, comprises a diverse set of i nstitutions and markets that, collectively, 
carry out traditional banking functions --but do so outside, or in ways only loosely linked to, the traditional 
system of regulated depository institutions.  Examples of important components of the shadow banking 
system include securitization vehicles, asset -backed commercial paper conduits, money market funds, 
markets for repurchase agreements, investment banks, and nonbank mortgage companies.  
8 Liquidity tools employed by the Federal Reserve that were closely tied to the central bank’s traditional 
role as lender of last resort involved the provision of short -term liquidity to depository and other financial 
institutions and included the traditional discount window, the Term Auction Facility (TAF), the Primary 
Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF), and the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF).  A second set of tools 
involved the provision of liquidity directly to borrowers and investors in those credit markets key to 
households and businesses where the expanding crisis threatened to materially impede the availability of 
financing.  The  Asset -Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF), 
the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF), the Money Market Investor Funding Facility (MMIFF), 
and the Te rm Asset -Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) fall into this category .  - 9 - 
The subsequent efforts to reform our regulatory framework have been focused on 
limiting the reemergence of the vulnerabilities that precipitated and exacerbated the 
crisis .  Changes in bank capital regulation under Basel III have significantly increased 
requirements for loss -absorbing capital  at global banking firms --including a surcharge for 
systemically important institutions and a ceiling on leverage .  The Federal Reserve’ s 
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review , or CCAR, process, a  descendant of the 
2009 stress test, requires that large financial institutions maintain  sufficient capital to 
weather extreme shocks , and that they demonstrate that their internal planning processes  
are effective; in addition, public disclosure of the results facilitates market discipline .  
The Basel III framework also includes liquidity requirement s designed to mitigate 
excessive reliance by global banks on short -term wholesale funding  and to otherwise 
constrain risks at those  banks .  Further steps are under way  to toughen the oversight of 
large institutions and to strengthen the financial infrastructure,  for example, by requiring 
central clearing with greater transparency for the trading of most standardized derivatives.  
 Oversight of the shadow banking system also has been strengthened .  For 
example, the new Financial Stability Oversight Council has desi gnated some nonbank 
firms as systemically important financial institutions , or SIFIs , subject to  consolidated 
supervision by the Federal Reserve.  In addition, measures are being undertaken to address the potential instability of short -term wholesale funding  markets , including 
reforms to money market funds and the triparty repo market.
9   
Of course, in a highly integrated global financial system, no country can 
effectively implement the financial reforms I  have described in isolation.  The good news 
                                                 
9 For a more comprehensive discussion of changes in the regulatory framework, see Tarullo (2013).   - 10 - 
is that s imilar reforms are being pursued throughout the world, with the full support of 
the United States and with  international bodies such as the Basel Committee and the 
Financial Stability Board providing coordination. 
More broadly, the approach to regul ation and supervision at the Federal Reserve 
has evolved to include a substantial macroprudential , or systemic, orientation  in addition 
to the traditional focus on individual institutions .  For example,  the Federal Reserve 
creat ed the Office of Financial S tability Policy and Research, which  coordinates System 
efforts to monitor  the interaction of financial institutions, financial markets, and 
economic developments to identify  emerging vulnerabilities and  systemic risks .10  
Enhanced monitoring of this type is  especially important as the changes in regulatory 
structure and financial innovation may lead risks to manifest in new ways or to migrate 
outside the perimeter of the current regulatory structure.  
Much progress has been made, but more remains to be done.  In addition to 
completing the efforts I have already mentioned , including the full implementation of 
new rules and supervisory responsibilities, the agenda still includes  further domestic and 
international cooperation to ensure the effectiveness of mechanisms  to allow the orderly 
resolution of insolvent institutions and thereby increase market discipline o n large 
institutions .11  The evaluation of potential  macroprudential tools  that might be used  to 
address emerging financial imbalances  is another high pri ority .  For example, the new 
Basel  III regulatory  capital framework includes a countercyclical capital buffer, which 
may help build additional resilience within the financial sector during  periods of buoyant 
                                                 
10 This monitoring framework is discussed in, for example, Adrian, Covitz, and Liang ( 2013).  
11 The Dodd -Frank Act, under the orderly liquidation authority in Title II, created an alternative resolution 
mechanism for SIFIs that takes into account both the need, for moral hazard reasons, to impose costs on the 
creditors of failing firms and t he need to protect financial stability; the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation, with the cooperation of the Federal Reserve, has been hard at work fleshing out this authority .  - 11 - 
credit creation .  Staff  members are investigating the potential of this and other  regulatory 
tools, such as cyclically sensitive  loan -to-value requirements  for mortgages , to improve 
financial stability.  A number of countrie s, including both advanced and emerging- market 
economies , have already deployed such measures, and their experiences should be 
instructive.   Although, in principle, monetary poli cy can be used to address financial 
imbalances, the presumption remains that  macroprudential tools, together with well-
focused traditional regulat ion and supervision, should serve as  the first line of defense 
against emerging threats to financial stability.   However, more remains to  be done to 
better understa nd how to design and implement more effective macroprudential tools and 
how these tools inte ract with  monetary policy . 
Monetary Policy  
While liquidity provision and other emergency steps were  critical to stemming the 
financial panic, a rapid shift in the stance of monetary policy was necessary to counteract 
the massive economic blow delivered by  the crisis.  The FOMC reduced the target federal 
funds rate from 5- 1/4 percent in the summer of 2007 to a range of 0 to 1/4 percent by the 
end of 2008, a very rapid easing.  The federal funds rate has been at its effective lower 
bound since then.   
To provide additional monetary policy accommodation despite the constraint 
imposed by the effective lower bound on interest rates, t he Federal Reserve turned to two 
alternative  tools:  enhanced forward guidance regarding the likely path of the federal 
funds rate  and large -scale purchase s of longer -term securities for the Federal Reserve ’s 
portfolio.  Other major central banks have responded to developments since 2008 in roughly similar ways.  For example, t he Bank of England and the Bank of Japan have  - 12 - 
employed  detailed  forward guidance and conducted large -scale asset purchases , while the 
European Central Bank has moved to reduce the perceived risk of sovereign debt, 
provided banks with substantial liquidity, and offered qualitative guidance regarding the future path of interest rates . 
With short -term rates near zero, expanded guidance about intentions for future 
policy has helped to shape  market expectations, which in turn has eased financial 
conditions by putting downward pressure on longer -term interest rates a nd helped support 
economic activity.  Forward guidance about the short -term interest rate supplements the 
broader policy framework I described earlier, by providing information about how the Committee expects to achieve its stated policy objectives despite  the complications 
created by the zero lower bound on the policy interest rate and uncertainties about the costs and efficacy of the available policy tools.  Beginning with qualitative guidance, the Committee’s communication about its anticipated future po licy has evolved  through 
several stages.  In December 2012, the Committee introduced state -contingent guidance, 
announcing for the first time that no increase in the federal funds rate target should be anticipated so long as unemployment remain ed above 6 -1/2 percent , inflation between 
one and two years ahead was projected to be no more than a half percentage point above 
the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run goal, and longer -term inflation expectations 
continue d to be well anchored .
12  My colleagues and I emph asized that the conditions 
stated in that guidance were thresholds, not triggers.  That is, crossing one of the thresholds would not automatically give rise to an increase in the federal funds rate target; instead, it would signal only that it would be appropriate for the Committee to 
                                                 
12 See Board of Governors (2012a) for the statement that introduced the state -contingent guidance.   - 13 - 
begin considering, based on a wider range of indicators, whether and when an increase in 
the target might be warranted.  
Large -scale asset purchases also provide monetary accommodation by lowering 
long-term interest rates .  Working through the portfolio- balance channel, asset purchases 
reduce the supply of long- duration assets in the hands of the public, depressing term 
premiums and thus reducing longer -term yields.  At times , the decision to begin or extend  
an asset -purchase program may  also have a signaling effect , to the extent that m arket 
participants see th at decision  as indicative of  policymakers’  commitment to an 
accommodative policy stance.  However, it is important to recognize that the potential signaling aspect of asset purchases depends on the broader economic and policy context.  In particular, the FOMC’s decision to modestly reduce the pace of asset purchases at its December meeting did not indicate any dimin ution of its commitment to maintain a 
highly accommodative monetary policy  for as long as needed ; rather, it reflected the 
progress we have made toward our goal of substantial improvement in the labor market outlook that we set out when we began the current purchase program in September 2012.  At its most recent meeting, t he Committee  reaffirmed and clarified its guidance on rates, 
stating that it expects to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate well past the time that the unemployment threshold of 6- 1/2 percent is crossed, especially if 
projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run goal.
13 
Have these unconventional tools been effective?  Skeptics have pointed out that 
the pace of recovery has been disappointingly slow, with inflation -adjusted GDP growth 
averaging only slightly higher than a 2 percent annual rate over the past few years and 
inflation below the Committee’s 2 percent longer -term target.  However, as I will discuss, 
                                                 
13 For the most recent FOMC statement , see Board of Governors (2013).   - 14 - 
the recovery has faced powerful headwinds, suggesting that economic growth might well 
have been considerably weaker, or even negative, without substantial  monetary policy 
support.  For the most part, research supports the conclusion that the combination of forward guidance and large -scale asset purchases has helped promote the recovery.  For 
example, changes in guidance appear to shift interest  rate expectations, and the 
preponderance of studies show that asset purchases push down longer -term interest rates 
and boost asset prices.
14  These changes in financial conditions in turn appear  to have 
provided material support to the economy.15 
Once the economy improves sufficiently so that  unconventional tools are no 
longer needed, the Committee will face issues of policy implementation and, ultimately, the design of the policy framework.  Large -scale asset purchases have increased the size 
of our balance sheet and created substantial excess reserves in the banking system.  Under the operating procedures  used  prior to the crisis, the presence of large quantities of 
excess reserves likely would h ave impeded the FOMC’s ability to raise short -term 
nominal interest rates when appropriate.  However, the Federal Reserve now has  effective 
tools to normalize the stance of policy when conditions warrant, without reliance on asset sales.  The interest rate on excess reserves can be raised, which will put upward pressure on short -term rates; in addition, the Federal Reserve will be able to employ other tools, 
such as fixed -rate overnight reverse repurchase agreements, term deposits, or term 
                                                 
14 There is a substantial recent research literature that has tried to quantify the effects of balance sheet 
policies on asset pricing. For example, see D’Amico and King (2013) and Krishnamurthy and Vissing-
Jorgenson (2011).  Research on the effects on mortgage rates includes Hancock and Passmore (2011).  
Research on the effects on corporate bond yields includes Gilchrist and Zakrajšek (2013) and Kiley (2013); Kiley (forthcoming b) examines the effects on U.S. equity prices.   For a recent study of the effectiveness of 
forward guidance, see Femia, Friedman, and Sack (2013).   
15 The range of macroeconomic frameworks used to judge the effects of these policy actions reflects the 
diversity of views within the profession of how to model the relevant empirical links, for e xample, Chung 
and others (2012); Fuhrer and Olivei (2011);  Chen, Cúrdia, and Ferrero (2012);  and Kiley (forthcoming a).

repurchase agreem ents, to drain bank reserves and tighten its control over  money  market 
rates  if this proves necessary .  As a result, at the appropriate time, the FOMC will be able 
to return to conducting monetary policy primarily through adjustments in the short -term 
policy rate.  It is possible, however, that some specific aspects of the Federal Reserve’s 
operating framework will change; the Committee will be considering this question in the 
future, taking into account what it learned from its experience with an expanded balance sheet and new tools for managing interest rates.  
Economic Prospects  
In the remainder of my remarks, I will reflect on the state of the U.S. economic 
recovery and its prospects. 
The economy has made considerable progress since the recovery officiall y began 
some four  and a half years ago.   Payroll employment has risen by  7-1/2 million jobs  from 
its trough.  Real GDP has grown in 16 of 17 quarters, and the level  of real GDP in the 
third quarter of 2013 was 5- 1/2 percent above its pre -recession peak.  T he unemployment 
rate has fallen from 10 percent in the fall of 2009 to 7 perce nt recently.  Industrial 
production and equipment investment have matched or exceeded pre -recession peaks.  
The banking system has been recapitalized , and the financial system is  safer.  When the 
economy was in free fall in late 2008 and early 2009, such improvement was far from certain, as indicated at the time by stock prices that were nearly 60 percent below current levels  and very wide credit spreads .  
Despite this progress , the recovery clearly remains incomplete.  At 7 percent, the 
unemployment rate still is  elevated.  The number of long -term unemployed remains  
unusually high, and other measures of labor underutilization, such as the number of  - 16 - 
people who are working part  time  for economic reasons, have improved less than the 
unemployment rate .  Labor force participation has continued to decline, and, although 
some of this decline reflects longer -term trends that were in place prior to the crisis, some 
of it likely reflects potential workers’ discouragement about job prospects.  
In retrospect, at least, many of the factors that held back the recovery can be 
identified.  Some of these factors  were difficult or impossible to anticipate, such as the 
resurgence in financial volatility associated with the European sovereign debt and 
banking crisis and the economic effects of natural disasters in Japan and elsewhere.  Other factors were more predictable; in particular , we appreciated  early on , though 
perhaps to a lesser extent than we might have, that the boom and bust left severe imbalances that would take time to work off.  As Carmen Reinhart  and Ken Rogoff noted 
in their prescient research , economic activity  following financial crises tends to be 
anemic, especially when the preceding economic expansion was accompanied by rapid 
growth in credit and real estate prices.
16  Weak recoveries from financial crises reflect , in 
part, the process of delevera ging and balance sheet repair:  Households pull back on 
spending  to recoup lost wealth and reduce debt burdens , while  financial institutions  
restrict credit to restore capital ratios and reduce the riskiness of their portfolios.  In 
addition to these financial factors, the weakness of the recovery reflects the overbuilding 
of housing (and, to some extent, commercial real estate) prior to the crisis, together with 
tight mortgage credit; indeed, recent activity in these areas is especially tepid in 
comparison to the rapid gains in construction more typically seen in recoveries. 
Although the Federal Reserve, like other forecasters, has tended to be 
overoptimistic in its forecasts of real GDP during this recovery, we have  also,  at times, 
                                                 
16 For example, see Reinhart an d Rogoff (2009).   See also Howard, Martin, and Wilson (2011).   - 17 - 
been too pessimistic in our forecasts of the unemployment rate.  For example, over the 
past year unemployment has declined notably more quickly than we or other forecasters expected , even as GDP growth was moderately lower than expected a year ago.  This 
discrepancy reflects a nu mber of factors, including declines in participation, but an 
important reason is the slow growth of productivity during this recovery; intuitively, when productivity gains are limited, firms need more workers even if demand is growing slowly.  Disappointing productivity growth accordingly must be added to the list of reasons that economic growth has been slower than hoped.
17  (Incidentally, the slow pace 
of productivity gains early in the recovery was not evident until well after the fact because of large data revisions --an illustration of the frustrations of real -time 
policymaking.)  The reasons for weak productivity growth are not entirely clear:  It may be a result of the severity of the financial crisis, for example, if tight credit conditions have inhibi ted innovation, productivity -improving investments, and the formation of new 
firms; or it may simply reflect slow growth in sales, which have led firms to use capital and labor less intensively, or even mismeasurement.  N otably, productivity growth has 
also flagged in a number of foreign economies that were hard -hit by the financial crisis.  
Yet another possibility is weak productivity growth reflects longer -term trends largely 
unrelated to the recession.  Obviously, the resolution of the productivity puzzl e will be 
important in shaping our expectations for longer -term growth.  
To this list of reasons for the slow recovery --the effects of the financial crisis, 
problems in the housing and mortgage markets, weaker -than-expected productivity 
growth, and events i n Europe and elsewhere --I would add one more significant factor --
                                                 
17 For a review of some of this recent literature, see Reifschneider, Wascher, and Wilcox (2013).  Other 
recent research on potential growth includes De Michelis, Estev ão, and Wilson (2013) and Haltmaier 
(2012).   - 18 - 
namely, fiscal policy.  Federal fiscal policy was expansionary in 2009 and 2010.18  Since 
that time, however, federal fiscal policy has turned quite restrictive; according to the 
Congressional  Budget Office, tax increases and spending cuts likely lowered output 
growth in 2013 by as much as 1- 1/2 percentage points.  In addition, throughout much of 
the recovery, state and local government budgets have been highly contractionary, reflecting their adjustment to sharply declining tax revenues.  To illustrate the extent of 
fiscal tightness, at the current point in the recovery from the 2001 recession, employment at all levels of government had increased by nearly 600,000 workers; in contrast, in the current recovery, government employment has declined by more than 700,000 jobs, a net 
difference of more than 1.3 million jobs.  There have been corresponding cuts in government investment, in infrastructure for example, as well as increases in taxes and 
reductions in transfers.  
Although long -term fiscal sustainability is a critical objective, excessively tight 
near-term fiscal policies have likely been counterproductive.  Most importantly, with 
fiscal and monetary policy working in opposite directions, the recovery is weaker than it otherwise would be.  But the current policy mix is particularly problematic when interest rates are very low, as is the case today.  Monetary policy has less room to maneuver 
when interest rates are close to zero, while expansion ary fiscal policy is likely both more 
effective and less costly in terms of increased debt burden when interest rates are pinned 
at low levels.  A more balanced policy mix might also avoid some of the costs of very 
low interest rates, such as potential ris ks to financial stability, without sacrificing jobs 
and growth.  
                                                 
18 For analysis of fiscal effects, see Congressional Budget Office (2013 ).  - 19 - 
I have discussed the factors that have held back the recovery, not only to better 
understand the recent past but also to think about the economy’s prospects.  The 
encouraging news is that the headwinds I have mentioned may now be abating.  Near -
term fiscal policy at the federal level remains restrictive , but the degree of restraint on 
economic growth seems likely to lessen somewhat  in 2014 and even more so in 2015; 
meanwhile, the budgetary situ ations of state and local governments have improved, 
reducing the need for further sharp cuts.  The aftereffects  of the housing bust also appear 
to have waned.  For example, notwithstanding the effects of somewhat higher mortgage rates, house prices have r ebounded, with one consequence being that the number of 
homeowners with “underwater” mortgages has dropped significantly, as have foreclosures and mortgage delinquencies.  Household balance sheets have strengthened considerably, with wealth and income risi ng and the household debt -service burden at its 
lowest level in decades.  Partly as a result of households’ improved finances, lending 
standards to households are showing signs of easing, though potential mortgage borrowers still face impediments.  Busines ses, especially larger ones, are also in good 
financial shape.  The combination of financial healing, greater balance in the housing market, less fiscal restraint, and, of course, continued monetary policy accommodation bodes well for U.S. economic growth in coming quarters.  But, of course, if the 
experience of the past few years teaches us anything, it is that we should be cautious in our forecasts.  
What about the rest of the world?  The U.S. recovery appears to be somewhat 
ahead of those of most other advanced industrial economies; for example, r eal GDP is 
still slightly below its  pre-recession peak in Japan and remains 2 percent and 3 percent  - 20 - 
below pre -recession peak s in the United Kingdom and the e uro area , respectively .  
Nevertheless, I see some grounds for cautious optimism abroad as well.  As in the United 
States, central banks in other advanced economies have taken significant steps to strengthen financial systems and to provide policy accommodation.  Financial -sector  
reform is proceeding, and the contractionary effects of tight fiscal policies are waning.  Although difficult reforms --such as banking and fiscal reform in Europe and structural 
reform in Japan --are still in early stages, we have also seen indications of better growth in 
the advanced economies, which sh ould have positive implications for the United States.  
Emerging  market economies have also grown somewhat more quickly lately  after a 
slowing in the first half of 2013.  Although growth prospects for the em erging markets 
continue to be good, here too the extent and effectiveness of structural reforms, like those currently under  way in China and Mexico, will be critical factors.  
Conclusion  
Last month we had a ceremony at the Board to commemorate the centennial of 
the signing of the Federal Reserve Act by President Woodrow Wi lson.  Over its 
100 years of existence, the Fed has faced numerous economic and financial challenges.  
Certainly the past few years will rank among some of the more difficult for the U.S. economy and for the Fed.  The experience has led to important changes at our institution, 
including new monetary policy tools, enhanced policy communication, a substantial increase in the institutional focus on financial stability and macroprudential policy , and 
increased transparency.  
We often speak of the Federal Reserve or other institutions as if they were 
autonomous actors.  Of course , they are not.  The Fed is made up of people, working  - 21 - 
within  an organizational structure and with an institutional culture and set of values.  I am 
very proud of my colleagues at the Fed for the hard work and creativity they have 
brought to bear in addressing the financial and economic cri sis, and I think we and they 
have been  well served by a culture that emphasizes object ive, expert analysis ; 
professionalism ; dedication ; and independence from political influence.  Whatever the

Thank you, Meredith and Cullum and thank you to the Society for the invitation 
to speak  to you today.  This week, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) took 
another significant step toward achieving our inflation objective  by raising the Federal 
Funds rate target by 75 basis points .  In my view, and I speak only for mys elf, if the data 
comes in as I expect I will support a similar -sized move at our July meeting.  The Fed is 
“all in” on re -establishing price stability, and part of that effort involves understanding 
the forces that have boosted inflation and also examining  how policymakers responded.  
Today, I intend to look back on monetary policy in 2020 and 2021, as I have before in 
recent speeches, but go a bit f urther and try to discern some  lessons learned.1   
In addition to the Federal Reserve’s emergency lending pr ograms , the monetary 
policy actions taken during this time were deemed extraordinary.  We swiftly lowered the 
target range for the federal funds rate to close to zero —the effective lower bound—and 
made an open -ended commitment to purchasing securities.  It was only the second time 
that the Fed had taken such dramatic steps .  But the first time for these actions was 
scarcely a decade ago, and there is good reason to think such a response may not be 
extraordinary anymore.  Structural changes in the economy have tended to lower interest 
rates and limit the room that the Federal Reserve will have to cut rates during a 
slowdown.2  I hope we never have another two years like 2020 and 2021 , but because  of

the low -interest-rate environment we now face, I believe that even in a typical recession 
there is a decent chance that we will be considering policy decisions in the future similar 
to those we made over the p ast two years.   Because of th at likelihood , it is especially 
useful to consider the lessons learned.   
Let’s start at the beginning, when the United States was faced with the economic 
shock from COVID -19.  Over several weeks starting in early March 2020, the FOMC 
lowered the target range for the federal funds rate to the effective lower bound  and began 
purchasing Treasuries and agency mortgage -backed securities ( MBS ).  M eanwhile, the 
Fed established  numerous liquidity and credit market facilities.3  All the se actions were 
taken to  support liquidity in the financial system and keep credit flowing to households, 
businesses and state and local governments.  A sset purchases  were undertaken in 
response to disruptions in  financial market s, particularly in the  normally stable  U.S. 
Treasury market.  Besides  support ing smooth market functioning , asset  purchases also 
aided in the transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions.    
Financial markets stabilized relatively quickly .  Over the course of 2020, the 
Fed’s liquidity and credit facilities saw reduced demand  and most of the emergency 
 
in a manner that depresses the real interest rate required to equilibrate savings and investment.  For 
example, lower trend economic growth likely lowers aggregate investment, while demographic factors such 
as an increase in life expectancy may increase s a vings.  Other research has emphasized an increase in 
demand for safe assets among emerging market economies, which depresses interest rates in advanced economies. For a review and references, see Michael Kiley (2020), “The Global Equilibrium Real Interest  
Rate: Concepts, Estimates, and Challenges,” Annual Review of Financial Economics , vol. 12 (1), pp. 305 –
26. 
3 Supported by funds provided by the CARES Act, the Federal Reserve created, with the authorization of 
the U.S. Treasury Department, a number of emergency lending facilities.  The extraordinary ‘dash for cash’ 
early in the pandemic threatened the orderly functioning of money markets as well as the flow of credit to employers. The Board responded with a set of emergency lending facilities that, collect ively supported the 
flow of credit throughout the economy both by providing backstops and, in some cases, by more directly supplying funding. Future downturns a re unlikely to see the same global, sharp, a nd intense demand for 
liquidity, and thus not warrant the same kind of emergency lending.   For more details on the Fed’s facilities 
to support households , businesses, and municipalities during the COVID crisis see the November 2020

programs were decommissioned around year  end.  Perhaps the most straightforward 
takeaway for monetary policy is that in times of severe stress, lending facilities, along 
with sharp  cuts to the federal funds rate and the introduction of large -scale asset 
purchases , are very effective in reviving the economy.  
There are some other lessons, I think, from the experience of tightening monetary 
policy, a process which was put in motion by the guidance that the FOMC issued in 2020 
about how long it would keep the federal funds rate at the effective lower bound and 
continue asset purchases.  In September and December  of 2020, the F OMC  provided 
criteria or conditions in the meeting statement that would need to be met before the 
FOMC would consider rais ing interest rates and begin to reduc e asset purchases , 
respectively .  These conditions were , in effect, the FOMC’s plan for starting the process 
of tightening policy.  This guidance was short  term, specific to the task of when to tighten 
policy in this current cycle , and focused on specific tools.    
Let me make an importan t distinction here.  A  bit earlier, in August 2020, the 
Committee completed a multi-year review of our overall strategy for achieving and 
sustaining our economic goals.  The strategy statement  is very different than the 
tightening guidance —it is about long er-run goals, not specific actions related to the 
current circumstances .  The goals in the strategy  statement apply in all economic 
circumstances  and d on’t include any details  on the settings of policy tools.   I mention this 
distinction because some have argued that the FOMC’s new strategy was a factor that led 
the Committee to wait too long to begin tightening monetary policy.  A bit later, I will 
explain why I do not believe this is the case , and I will explain how the guidance for  - 4 - 
tightening policy, laid out in the FOMC ’s post-meeting statements , was the basis for our 
decisions .   
So, let’s think about how the economy evolved and how the criteria for that 
guidance steer ed the path of policy.  In early 2021, the Committee began noting whether 
the economy was making progress toward our employment and inflation goals, and thus 
getting closer to decisions on unwinding our highly accommodative policy.    Based on 
our positive experience with unwinding after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) , we 
thought it would be appropriate to use  the same sequence of steps: taper asset purchases 
until they ceased, then lift rates off the  effective lower bound, then gradually and 
passively reduce our balance sheet by redeeming maturing securities.  Most importantly, 
through various communications, w e made it clear that tapering of asset purchases would 
have to be complete d before rate liftoff to avoid the conflict that would occur by easing 
via continuing  asset purchases versus  tighten ing through rate hikes.  
In the previous episode of tightening policy after extraordinary accommodation, 
this process was very gradual.  Tapering of asset purchases took 11 months, and then the 
first rate hike did not occur until more than a year after purc hases ended.  Balance sheet 
reduction began more than a year and half after that.  This gradualism worked well then, 
and it surely influenced the Committee’s approach this time.     
   Implementing this approach  required two pieces of guidance : first, criteria for 
beginning the tapering process , and, second, criteria to begin raising the policy rate from 
the effective lower bound.   Through explicit language in FOMC statements , we told the 
public the necessary conditions  that needed to be met before we would  adjust  these two 
policies.    - 5 - 
For asset purchases, the Committee declared that tapering would wait “until 
substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee’s maximum 
employment and price stability goals.”4  Meanwhile, t he FOMC said that it would keep 
rates near zero until our employment goal  had been reached and until inflation had 
reached 2 percent and was “on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.”5   
A fair question is: w hat did these words mean?  And, i n particular, what did the 
phrases “substantial further progress” for tapering and “for some time” for liftoff  mean?  
In large part the interpretation hinged on how the Committee viewed the economy would 
recover from the pandemic.  Looking across forecasts  at the time by Committee 
participants  and the private sector, no one expected substantial progress toward both our 
goals to happen very soon.  The economy had begun the recover, but at the end of 2020 
COVID was bad and getting worse  and vaccines were just  arriving , so we didn’t know 
how soon schools would reopen and people would get back to work.  In November and 
December 2020, the u nemployment rate was 6.7 percent  and inflation seemed  to be in 
check : 12-month personal consumption expenditures  inflation was declining, and  core 
inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, was more or less steady at 1.5 
percent.   The Summary of Economic Projections by FOMC participants in December 
2020 had the unemployment rate moving down to 4.2 percent at the end of 2022 and 
 
4 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2021), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC 
Statement,” press release, June 16, 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20210616a.htm  
 
5 This phrase echoed a new detail in our monetary policy strategy that recognized the  12 years that inflation 
had run persistently below 2 percent and noted that as a  result, “appropriate monetary policy will likely a im 
to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time. ” See Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System (202 0), “2020 Statement on Longer -Run Goals a nd Monetary Policy Strategy,” policy 
statement, August 27, https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review -of-monetary- policy -strategy -
tools -a nd-communications -statement -on-longer -run-goals -monetary -policy -strategy.htm .    - 6 - 
inflation moving up to 2 percent only in 2023 .  Only one participant had liftoff occurring 
by the end of 2022.    
Based on this SEP, the Committee did not expect the economy to recover quickly.   
And, looking at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Primary Dealers 
back in January of 2021, the median respondent thought tapering would start in the first 
quarter of 2022 and liftoff wouldn’t be until the end of 2023 or later.  
To move forward, policymakers had to evaluate “substanti al further progress ” and 
“for some time .”  The phrases, admittedly, are not concrete in their meaning.  Inflation 
averaging doesn’t define how much above 2 percent is moderate and how long some 
value of elevated inflation should be tolerated.  In addition,  for assessing progress on the 
health of the labor market, different policymakers will prefer different measures  that may 
not provide the exact same signal .  On top of this, the data used to measure progress in 
the labor market can revise substantially and  reshape the evaluation of the strength of this 
market qui te quickly.  For example , a key input —payroll data —in the  latter half of 202 1 
painted a picture of a slow ing labor market .  But revised data over several subsequent 
months  revealed  that the slowdown  never happened.  I nstead, job gains were quite robust .  
In particular , initial reports of j ob creation between August and December were a 
cumulative 1.4 million, but by February of this year that number was revised up to nearly 
2.9 million.    
Overall, the economy evolved rapidly  in 2021 .  I won’t get into the month-by-
month details, as I have in recent speeches, but  by October  and November , policymakers  
thought the economy had improved enough to meet the criteria to start taper ing at the 
early Nov ember meeting.  Then, later that month, data indicated  inflation was  - 7 - 
accelerat ing, so the Committee hastened the pace of tapering  at the December  meeting , 
making a plan to wind  down purchases by early March .  Between December and March 
of this year inflation data came in very elevated, and  at that point there was  no question 
that inflation had been above 2 percent for “some time.”  Given continued improvement 
in the labor market and the high inflation readings , the Committee began raising interest 
rates  in March , as soon as asset purchases were completed . 
With th ese actions in the rearview mirror, we can now ask: k nowing what we 
know now,  should we have done anything differently?  To be clear, by asking this 
ques tion my intent is not to criticize the decisions of the Committee.  Rather, it is to 
assess our policy strategies should we be confronted with another crisis in the future.  
One question to ask is whether the guidance we issued was too “restrictive” ; in 
other words, did it allow enough flexibility for the FOMC to begin  raising the policy rate  
when it was appropriate to ?  Recall, we had decided  that raising the policy rate would not 
occur until the tapering of asset purchases had finished.   But to finish, tap ering must 
start—for a given pace of tapering, the longer it takes to start tapering, the longer it will 
be before the policy rate can be raised.  Of course, one can keep the liftoff date fixed and 
simply taper at a much faster rate, including the possibility of a hard stop of asset 
purchases.  But concerns about  financial market functioning , including the ability of 
markets to absorb the purchases the Fed stops making,  typically limits how fast the 
tapering can be, particularly given  the amount of asset purchases we were making at the 
time ($120 billion per month).  
Given the tapering criteria and subsequent data, w e ultimately had to pivot hard to  
accelerate the tapering pace and , in fact , completed the tapering of purchases just a few  - 8 - 
days before w e lifted off.  Unlike the normalization timeline after the financial crisis , we 
did not have flexibility to raise the target range sooner.  However, i f we had less 
restrictive tapering criteria and had started tapering sooner , the Committee c ould have 
had more flexibility  on when to begin raising rates .6  So, by requiring substantial further 
progress toward maximum employment to even begin the process of tightening policy, 
one might argue that it locked the Committee into holding the policy rate at the zer o 
lower bound longer than was optimal.  
My takeaway is that  a less restrictive tapering criteria would have allowed more 
flexibility to taper “sooner and gradually, ’ as opposed to the relatively “later and faster” 
approach that occurred .  Experience has shown that markets need time to adjust to a turn 
from accommodation to tightening, and that surely was a factor for FOMC statements 
over the years in framing criteria for key policy actions during the recovery from the 
GFC and the pandemic .  So, I’m supportive of issuing such criteria but we need to be 
careful to use language that allows the Committee the flexibility it needs to respond to 
changing economic and financial conditions.   
Now let’s turn to the liftoff criteria.  It was also quite restrictive.  The liftoff 
criteria required the economy to be in a situation where our dual mandate had been  
achieved.  It can be argued that this meant getting the economy back to its 2019 state with 
very low unemployment and inflation near 2 percent .  But the policy rate in 2019 was 
well above zero and close to its neutral value.   Consequently, if the state of the economy 
 
6 There are a couple of reasons why a less restrictive tapering  criteria  c an create more policy space.  First, a 
less restrictive ta pering criteria allow s policymakers to reduce the a mount of purchases, perhaps more than 
once  or even potentially end purchases , a ll while a  more restrictive criteria  may not even be triggered.  
Second, if policymakers believe that market functioning considerations constr ain the  dolla r amount that 
Fed purchases can be reduced in a given month, then a policy with less restrictive criteria that has started 
tapering may be able to end purchas es before one with a more restrictive criteria .      - 9 - 
is telling you to be at neutral and you are at zero, then any Taylor rule w ould say the 
policy rate needs to rise  much  faster than was typically done in the past.   
So, it should not have been a surprise that the policy rate would rise fast in 2022 .  
Rate hikes would need to be larger and more frequent, relative to the 2015-2018 
tightening pace, to get back to neutral.  Looking back, should the Committee have 
signaled a steeper rate path once the liftoff criteria had been met?  Perhaps another  lesson 
is that giving forward guidance about liftoff should also include forward  guidance about 
the possible path of the policy rate after liftoff.    
In closing, I hope that our country is not faced with another crisis as severe as the 
one precipitated by COVID, and that the Fed is not faced with the challenges of setting 
monetary policy under such conditions.  But if we again  face those challenges, we now 
have the additional insight that only experience can bring.  I hope that this latest 
experience will help us approach the  future with a more complete understanding of the 
policy choices  and tradeoffs .   ",2022-06-18,waller

Tailored Supervision of Community Banks  
    
Remarks

Janet L. Yellen  
 
Chair  
 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  
 
 
at the 
 
Independent Community Bankers of America  
2014 Washington Policy Summit  
 
 
Washington, D .C. 
      
May 1 , 2014 Thank you for inviting me to ICBA’s policy summit.  I am pleased to have th is 
opportunity to share my views on some of the key issues facing community banks  and how I see  
the community banking model fitting into the  financial system  in the years ahead .  In particular, I 
will discuss steps the Federal Reserve has taken to address the “too -big-to-fail” problem and how 
these steps affect community banks; I will describe how the Fed strives to improve our 
understanding of the unique role that community banks play in the economy; and then I’ll show how we are using this knowledge to be tter tailor our supervisory expectations and approaches to 
community banks.  
 As you may know, before I rejoined the Federal Reserve Board as Vice Chair in 2010, I 
had the privilege of serving for six years as president and chief executive of the Federal Reserve 
Bank of San Francisco.  The 12th district is the largest of the Fed ’s districts, covering nine 
western states , and it is home to a significant number of community banks, the majority of which 
are supervised by the San Francisco Fed directly or indirectly through bank holding c ompanies.  
Community bankers helped me , when I served as president , to take the pulse of the local 
economy and also to understand how regulatory and policy decisions in Washington affect financial institutions of different sizes and types, sometime s in very different ways.  During the 
financial crisis, I saw firsthand the challenges that community banks faced in a crisis they did 
little to cause, and I have felt strongly ever since that  the Fed must do what it can to ensure that 
the actions  taken following the crisis do not place undue  burdens on your institutions.   
 I believe a healthy financial system relies on institutions of different sizes performing a 
variety of functions and serving different needs.  In some communities, your banks are actually 
situated  on Main Street, but all c ommunity banks serve Main Street  by providing credit  to small 
business owners, homebuyers, households, and farmers.        - 2 - 
 
Because of their importan t role, I am pleased that  the condition of many community 
banks ha s been improving .  Although there is still considerable revenue pressure from low 
margins, earnings for most community banks have rebounded since the financial crisis.  Asset 
quality and capital ratios continue to improve, and the number of problem banks continues to 
decline.  Notably, after several years of reduced lending following the recession, we are starting 
to see slow but  steady loan growth at community banks .  While this expansion in lending must 
be prudent , on balance I consider  this growth an encouraging sign of an improving economy .   
Addressing Too  Big to Fail 
Let me begin  by discussing an issue that I know has been on the minds  of many 
community bankers:  how policymakers are addressing the problem of banks that are perceived 
to be too big to fail.1  Community banks share the interest we all have in reducing the systemic 
risk posed by firms that are large, complex, and interconnected, and also in reducing any  
potential competitive advantages that such firms may enjoy  as a result of too -big-to-fail.

addresses the too -big-to-fail issue th rough steps intended to limit both the likelihood that 
systemically important firms would fail  and the potential damage from any that do.  T he Federal 
Reserve and the other financial regulatory agencies have issued  a number  of regulations to 
implement the requirements set forth in the legislation  and to enhance the supervision of the 
largest financial firms .

But even before Dodd- Frank became law , the Federal Reserve began to strengthen its 
oversight of the largest , most complex banking firms and require  these firms to materia lly 
improve their capital adequacy .  For example, in 2009, we conducted the first stress tests of the 
largest 19 U.S. bank holding companies.  That test has subsequently evolved into our annual 
Comprehensive C apital Analysis and R eview, known as CCAR, whic h requires all bank holding 
companies with total assets of $50 billion or more to submit annual capital plans for review by the Federal Reserve.  CCAR  help s ensure that the largest banking organizations will have 
enough capital to continue operati ng throug h times of economic and financial stress .
2  To be 
clear, as the federal banking agencies have stated previously, these stress testing and capital 
planning requirements do not, and should not, apply to community banks.3  
In addition to strengthening requirements for stress testing and capital planning, the 
agencies have also strengthened capital requirements for the largest firms by approving more robust risk- based and leverage capital requirements.  Because the financial crisis demonstrated 
the importance of having adequate levels of high- quality capital at banks of all sizes, many 
elements of the revised capital framework appl y to all banking organizations.  In designing the 
revised  capital rules, however, the agencies co nsidered financial stability risks and adjusted the

     Pursuant to the Dodd -Frank Act, the Federal Reserve and the other federal banking agencies require banking 
organizations with total consolidated assets between $10 billion and $50 billion to conduct annual company -run 
stress tests.  The agencies recently published guidance to clarify supervisory expectations for these firms.  See Board of Gove rnors of the Federal Reserve System (Board of Governors), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), 
and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) (2014), “Agencies Issue Final Dodd -Frank Act Stress Test

final rules to make the requirements substantially more rigorous for the largest, most 
systemically important banking organizations than for community banks.4   
While we have taken a number of steps to ad dress too- big-to-fail concerns, our  work is 
not finished.  Because the failure of a systemic institution could impose significant costs on the 
financial system and the economy, the Board  recently finalized a requirement for the eight large , 
globally systemic banks to meet a significantly higher leverage requirement  than other banking 
organizations .  And  we are working  to implement risk -based capital surcharges for these 
systemically important firms.  W e also need to ensure that the new rules are embedded in  our 
supervision of the largest firms ; and , we must  continue to watch for emerging  sources of 
systemic risk and take steps  as appropriate to address these risks .   
One such risk that the Federal Reserve has been monitoring closely is the reliance of 
some firms on potentially volatile short -term wholesale funding.5  We are carefully considering 
the systemic vulnerabilities that may be posed by overreliance on short -term wholesale funding  
and are weighing potential policy responses.  Whi le it would be premature to indicate whether or 
how we might address these vulnerabilities, I can say that few, if any, community banks are 
reliant on levels of short -term wholesale funding that could raise concerns about systemic risk, 
and regulators woul d carefully consider the ramifications of any action, including the effect on 
community banks . 
                                                 
4 To help non -complex community banking organizations better understand th e new capital rule, the agencies 
published a guide that summarizes changes to the capital rules for exposures commonly held by such organizations.

Improving Our Understanding of Community Banks  
In carefully considering how our actions affect community banks, the Federal Reserve is 
committed to understanding  your institutions  and the challenges you face.   We continue to try to 
improve that understanding in two important ways --research and outreach.  The Fed is uniquely 
positioned to employ these two methods  because of our traditional strength as a research 
institution and because of our structure, with Reserve Banks that have deep roots in communities 
in every region of the country .  
In the past several years, research staff across the Federal Reserve System who were 
independently exploring issues related to c ommunity banking have develop ed an informal 
network to share findings and identify areas for further research .  After some of the fruits of this 
effort were shared with the Board, we decided  to join with the Conference of State Bank 
Supervisors (CSBS) to host a research and policy conference focused on community banks.  This 
conference, “Community Banking in the 21st Century,”  was held in October 2013 at the Federal 
Reserve Bank of St. Louis .6   It was one of very few research conferences to focus specifically 
on community banks  and also brought together research ers, community bankers, policymakers, 
and bank supervisors  to discuss the practical implications of the  papers presented.   
Among the topics that researchers addressed in their papers were the link between bank 
failures and local economic performance,7 the role of management in the performance of

community banks,8 and the impact of Dodd- Frank on community banks .9  I’m pleased to say that 
the conference  was so successful that the Federal Reserve and CSBS are planning another in 
September.10   
In addition to research, our understanding of community banks is enhanced by the Fed’s 
outreach to  community bankers.  At the most basic level, supervisory staff at each Reserve Bank 
gain insights from their regular contact with community bankers .  Additional  knowledge comes 
by way of  community outreach initiatives , which provide the added benefit of informing the Fed 
about local economic conditions.   Here in Washing ton, in addition to participating in events like 
this one , the Board of Governors meets twice a year with the Community Depository Institutions 
Advisory Council (CDIAC).11 The council, which includes representatives from small banks, 
credit unions, and savi ngs associations from each Federal Reserve district, provides information 
about economic conditions around the country and those issues that are of greatest concern to 
community institutions .   
In addition, we have been taking steps to improve our communic ation with community 
bankers.  In that regard, we have been using various platforms to go beyond formal policy issuances and better explain our supervisory expectations f or community banks.  W e have also

developed and continue to enhance our industry training efforts.  In particular, we have 
developed two programs --Ask the Fed and Outlook Live --that have become quite popular with 
community bankers who are interested in learning more about topics that are of importance to 
both banks and supervisors.  As k the Fed is a program for officials of state member banks, bank 
and thrift holding companies, and state bank commissioners.  Outlook Live, which is a 
companion program to the Federal Reserve ’s quarterly Consumer Compliance Outlook  
publication, is a webinar  series on consumer compliance issues that is led by Federal Reserve 
staff.12   
We are also now using periodic newsletters and other communication tools to highlight 
information that community banker s may be interested in  know ing and to provide information on 
how examiners will assess compliance with Federal Reserve policies.  In  addition to Consumer 
Compliance Outlook , in 2012 the Federal Reserve System established a Community Banking 
Connections  website and quarterly newsletter to focus on safety -and-soundness issues that are of 
practical interest to community bankers  and bank board members .13  The Federal Reserve also 
launched a series of special -purpose publications called FedLinks .14  These publ ications 
highlight key elements of specific supervisory topics and discuss how examiners will typically 
address the topic.  The common goal for all of the se outreach  efforts  is build ing and sustaining  
an ongoing  dialogue with community bankers.

Tailored Community Bank Supervision  
One theme that has come through loud and clear in this  outreach is concern about 
regulatory burden.  The financial crisis has prompted significant changes to regulation, so the 
Federal Reserve understands  this concern  and strive s to minimize regulatory burden for all 
institutions, including community banks.  A t the same time , we are taking  a fresh look at how we 
supervise community banks and possible ways that supervision can be smarter , more nimble, and 
more effective.  In that r egard, and consistent with my earlier points about  too big  to fail, we 
know that a one -size-fits-all approach to supervision is often not appropriate .  In recent years , we 
have taken a number of actions to tailor supervisory expectations  to the size and complexity of 
the banking organizations we supervise.    
The first step is t aking a disciplined approach to judging which supervisory policies 
should apply to community banking organizations.  This involves not only weighing the costs and benefits of proposed rules and their implementation, but in some cases also asking  whether it 
makes sense for a specific policy to apply to community banks.   
In other cases, it may not make sense to exclude community banking organizations 
entirely from th e scope of a supervisory policy, but we may be able to scale expectations to the 
size and complexity of the supervisory portfolio, to minimize the burden where possible  and 
appropriate.  The final capital rules for community banks that I mentioned earlier illustrate  this 
kind of tailoring .  
Let me turn now to upcoming changes in the accounting standard for credit loss es on 
loans and securities .  We have heard the concern that overly complex accounting rules in this 
area would increase costs with little  benefit for the users of community bank financial 
statements .  We are working with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)  to help - 9 - 
 
ensure that the new standard, which is an important component of financial reform efforts, can 
be implemented in a re asonable and practical way for community banks.  We have stressed to 
FASB that its proposal should not require community banks to utilize  complex modeling 
processes.  We expect that a final standard will permit loss -estimation techniques that build upon 
current credit -risk management techniques used by community banks.15  We will work with 
community banks to help implement the new standard when it is final.  In addition, our 
supervisory guidance will emphasize that regulatory expectations for implementation of the 
standard will differ based on bank size and complexity.   
 In addition to tailoring our rules, we are also taking steps to tailor and improve our 
examination processes to be more efficient and effective.  For example, we are currently in the 
process  of developing and adopting common technology tools across the Federal Reserve System 
that should allow our examiners to more effectively focus their time and enhance the consistency of our examination processes nationwide.   
Furthermore , we are exploring ways that our community bank examiners may be able to 
complete more examination work off  site.  For example, for banks that have electronic loan files, 
examiners may be able to read these files off  site rather than on the bank premises.  We are also 
seeking ways to utilize the financial information that we collect from banks to tailor the 
examination procedures that are used on site, with less work being required at institutions with

lower risk profiles.  These efforts should reduce the disru ption that an on- site examination can 
cause to a bank ’s day -to-day operations.   
We recently adopted a new consumer compliance examination framework for community 
banks .16  Under this new  program, our consumer compliance examiners base examination 
intensity  more explicitly on the individual community bank’s risk profile, weighed against the 
effectiveness of the bank’s compliance controls.  W e expect that examiners will spend less time 
on low -risk compliance issues at community banks , increasing the efficienc y of our supervision 
and reducing regulatory burden on many community banks.   
Much of the work to tailor our supervisory requirements and programs is being overseen 
by the community bank subcommittee of the Board’s Committee on Bank Supervision.  This 
subcommittee oversees the supervision of community and regional banks and reviews proposed supervisory policies to help ensure that they are appropriate for, and tailored to, community banks.  This subcommittee was formed several years ago under the direction of now former governors Betsy Duke and Sarah Bloom Raskin, and I want to assure you that the subcommittee 
will continue to play an important  role in helping ensur e that our supervisory policies make sense 
for community banks.  I should also add that we are working closely with our colleagues at the 
state level to help ensure that our supervisory approaches and methodologies are as consistent as possible.

 In closing, let me repeat my strong belief that community banks will continue to play an 
important role in our financial system in the years ahead, serving the credit needs of the 
communities they are a part of and know so well.  The Federal Reserve will continue to  promote 
a stronger and more resilient financial system, while  carefully considering  the effects of our 
actions on community banks  and tailoring supervision appropriately.

April 6, 2018 
  
For more than 90 years, the Economic Club of Chicago has provided a valued 
forum for current and future leaders to discuss issues of vital interest to this city and our 
nation.  I am honored to have the opportunity to speak to you here today .   
At the Federal Reserve, we seek to foster a strong economy for the benefit of 
individuals, families, and businesses throughout our country.  In pursuit of that 
overarching objective, t he Congress has assigned us the goal s of achieving maximum 
employment and stable prices, known as the dual mandate .  Today I will review recent 
economic developments , focusing on the labor market and inflation, and  then touch 
briefly on longer -term growth prospects .  I will finish with a disc ussion of monetary 
policy.     
Recent Developments and the State of the Economy  
After what at times has been a slow recovery from the financial crisis and the 
Great Recession, growth has picked up.  Unemployment has fallen from 10 percent at its 
peak in Oc tober 2009 to 4.1 percent, the lowest level in nearly two decades (figure 1).  
Seventeen million jobs have been created in this expansion, and the monthly pace of job 
growth remains more than sufficient to employ  new entrants to the labor force (figure 2).   
The labor market has been strong, and my colleagues and I on the Federal Open Market 
Committee  (FOMC) expect it to remain strong.  Inflation has continued to run below the 
FOMC’s 2 percent objective but we expect it to move up in coming months and to 
stabilize around 2 percent over the medium term.  
Beyond the labor market, there are other signs of economic strength.  Steady 
income gains, rising household wealth, and elevated consumer confidence continue to 
support consumer spending, which accounts for  about two thirds of economic output.   - 2 - 
Business investment improved markedly last year following two subpar years, and both 
business surveys and profit expectations point to further gains ahead.  Fiscal stimulus and 
continued accommodative financial conditions  are supporting both household spending 
and business investment, while strong global growth has boosted U.S. exports. 
As many of you know, each quarter FOMC participants --the members of the 
Board of Governors and the presidents of the Reserve Bank s--submit  their individual 
projections for growth, unemployment, and inflation, as well as their forecasts of the 
appropriate path of the federal funds rate, which the Committee uses as the primary tool 
of monetary policy.  These individual projections are compiled and published in the 
Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP.  FOMC participants  submitted their most 
recent forecasts t hree weeks ago, and those forecasts show a strengthening in the 
medium -term economic outlook (table 1).  As you can see, participants g enerally raised 
their forecasts for growth in inflation -adjusted gross domestic product  (GDP) and 
lowered their forecasts for unemployment.  In addition, many participants expressed  
increased confidence that inflation would move up toward our 2 percent target.  The  
FOMC sees  the risks to the economic outlook as roughly balanced.   
The State of the Labor Market  
As I mentioned, the headline unemployment rate has declined to levels not seen 
since 2000.  The median projection in the March SEP calls for unemployment to fall well 
below 4 percent  for a sustained period, something that has not happened since the late 
1960s.  This strong labor market forecast has important implications for the fulfillment of 
both side s of the dual mandate , and thus for the path of monetary policy .  So I will spend 
a few minutes exploring the state of the job market in some detail.       - 3 - 
A good place to begin is with the term “maximum employment,”  which the 
Committee takes to mean the highest utilization  of labor resource s that is sustainable over 
time.   In the long run, t he level of m aximum employment is not determined by monetary 
policy, but rather by factors affecting the structure and dynamics of the labor market.1  
Also, the level of maximum employment is not directly measureable, and it changes over 
time.  Real -time estimates of maximum employment are highly uncertain.2  Recognizing 
this uncertainty, the FOMC does not set a fixed goal for maximum employment.  Instead, 
we look at  a wide range of indicators  to assess how close the economy is to maximum 
employment.   
The headline unemployment rate is arguably the best single indicator of labor 
market conditions .  In addition, it is widely known and updated each month.  As I noted, 
the unemployment rate is currently at 4.1 percent, which is a bit below the FOMC’s 
median estimate of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment.  H owever, the 
unemployment rate does not paint a complete picture.  For example, to be counted in the 
official measure as unemployed, a person must have actively looked for a job in the past 
four weeks.3  People who have not looked for work as recently are counted not as 
unemployed, but as out of the labor force , even though some of them  actually want a job 
                                                 
1 See t he FOMC’s Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, amended effective 
January 30 , 2018, available on the Board’s website at 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf . 
2 This fundamental uncertainty has been extensively studied, particularly with respect to the most 
commonly used measure of full employment --the so -called natural rate o f unemployment.  The authors of 
one well -regarded study concluded that even when using sophisticated statistical techniques, the natural 
rate of unemployment could be as much as 1 -1/2 percentage points above or below their point estimate.  
See Douglas Stai ger, James H. Stock, and Mark W. Watson (1997), “How Precise Are Estimates of the 
Natural Rate of Unemployment?” chapter 5 in Christina D. Romer and David H. Romer, eds., Reducing 
Inflation:  Motivation and Strategy  (Chicago:  University of Chicago Press),  pp. 195- 246, 
www.nber.org/chapters/c8885.pdf .   
3 Individuals expecting to be recalled from a temporary layoff are also counted as unemployed whether or 
not they are actively looking for work.   - 4 - 
and are available to work.  Others working part time may want a full- time job.  And still 
others who say that they do not want a job right now might be pulled into the job market 
if the right opportunity came along.  So, in judging tightness in the labor market, we also 
look at a range of other statistics, including alternative measures of unemployment, as 
well as measures of vacancies and job flows, survey s of households ’ and businesses’ 
perceptions of the job market, and, of course, data on wages and prices.   
Figure 3 shows the headline unemployment rate and two  broader measures of 
unemployment, known as U -5 and U -6.4  U-5 includes the unemployed plus peo ple who 
say they want a job and  have looked for one in the past year  (though not in the past four 
weeks ).  U-6 includes all those counted in U -5 plus  people who are working part time but 
would like full -time work.  Like the headline unemployment rate, both U -5 and U -6 have 
declined significantly in recent years.  They are now at  levels seen before the financial 
crisis, though not quite as low as they w ere in 199 9 to 2000, a period of very tight job 
market conditions. 
The left panel of the next chart shows that employers are having about as much 
difficulty now attracting qualified workers as they did 20 years ago  (figure 4).  Likewise, 
the job vacancy rate, shown on the right, is close to its all -time high, as is the average 
number of weeks it takes to fill a job opening.5  Households also are increasingly 
reporting that jobs are plentiful (figure 5), which is consistent with the high level of job 
posting s reported by firms.  In addition, the proportion of workers quitting their jobs is 
high, suggesting that workers are being hired away from their current employers and that 
                                                 
4 The o fficial unemployment rate  is known as U -3.

and start in 2000.   - 5 - 
others are confident enough about their prospects to leave jobs voluntarily --even b efore 
they have landed their next job.   
While the data I have discussed thus far do point to a tight labor market, other 
data are less definitive.  The labor force participation rate, which measures the percentage 
of working age individuals who are either  working or actively looking for a job, has 
remained steady for about four years  (figure 6).  This flat performance is actually a sign 
of improvement, since increased retirements as our population ages have been putting 
downward pressure on participation a nd will continue to do so.  However, the 
participation rate of prime -age workers (those between the ages of 25 and 54) has not 
recovered fully to its pre -recession level, suggesting that there might still be room to pull 
more people into the labor force (f igure 7).  Indeed, the strong job market does appear to 
be drawing back some people who have been out of the labor force for a significant time.  
For example, the percentage of adults returning to the labor force  after previously 
reporting that they were n ot working because of a disability  has increased over the past 
couple of years, and anecdotal reports indicate that employers are increasingly willing to 
take on and train workers they would not have considered in the past.6   
Wage growth has also remained  moderate, though it has picked up compared with 
its pace in the early part of this recovery (figure 8).  Weak productivity growth is an 
important reason why we have not seen larger wage gains in recent years.  At the same 
time, the absence of a sharper ac celeration in wages suggests that the labor market is not 
excessively tight.  I will be looking for an additional pickup in wage growth as the labor 
market strengthens further.

 Taking all of these measures of labor utilization on board, what can we say ab out 
the state of the labor market relative to our statutory goal of maximum employment?   
While uncertainty around the long run level of these indicators is substantial, m any of 
them suggest  a labor market that is in the neighborhood of  maximum employment.  A 
few other measures continue to suggest some remaining  slack.  Assessments of the 
maximum level of employment are uncertain, however, and subject to revision.  As we 
seek the highest sustainable utilization of labor resources, the Committee will be guided 
by incoming data across all of these meas ures.    
Inflation  
That brings me to inflation --the other leg of our dual mandate.  T he substantial  
improvement in the labor market  has been accompanied by low inflation.  Indeed, 
inflation has continued to run below our 2 percent longer -run objective (figure 9).  
Consumer prices, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, 
increased 1.8 percent over  the 12 months ending in February.  The core price index, 
which excl udes the prices of energy and food and is typically a better indicator of future 
inflation, rose 1.6 percent over the same period.  In fact, both of these indexes have been 
below 2 percent consistently for the past half -dozen years.  This persistent shortf all in 
inflation from our target has led some to question the traditional relationship between 
inflation and the unemployment rate, also known as the Phillips c urve.  Given how low 
the unemployment rate is, why aren’t we seeing higher inflation now?  
As th ose of you who carefully read the minutes of each FOMC meeting are 
aware-- and I know there are some of you out there --we had a thorough discussion of 
inflation dynamics at our January meeting.  Almost all of the participants in that  - 7 - 
discussion thought that  the Phillips c urve remained a useful basis for understanding 
inflation.  T hey also acknowledged, however, that the link between labor market 
tightness and changes in inflation has become weaker and more difficult to estimate, 
reflecting in part the extend ed period of low and stable inflation in the United States and 
in other advanced economies.  Participants also noted that other factors, including 
inflation expectations and transitory changes in energy and import prices, can affect 
inflation.  
 My view is that the data continue to show a relationship between the overall state 
of the labor market and the change in inflation  over time .  That connection has weakened 
over the past couple of decades, but it still persists, and I believe it continues to be 
meanin gful for monetary policy.  Much of the shortfall in inflation in recent years is well 
explained by high unemployment during the early years of the recovery and by falling 
energy prices and the rise in the dollar in 2015 and 2016.  But the decline in inflation last 
year, as labor market conditions improved significantly, was  a bit of a surprise.  The 2017 
shortfall from our 2 percent goal appears to reflect, at least partly, some unusual price 
declines, such as for mobile phone plans, that occurred nearly a year ago.  In fact, 
monthly inflation readings have been firmer  over the past several months, and the 12-
month change should move up notably this spring as last spring’s soft readings drop out 
of the 12- month calculation.  Consistent with this view, the me dian of FOMC 
participants’ projections in our March survey shows inflation moving up to 1.9 percent 
this year and to 2 percent in 2019.  
Longer -Run Challenges   - 8 - 
Although job creation is strong and unemployment is low, the U.S. economy 
continues to face some important longer -run challenges.  GDP growth has averaged just 
over 2 percent per year in the current economic expansion, much slower than in previous 
expansio ns.  Even the higher growth seen in recent quarters remains below the trend 
before the crisis.  Nonetheless , the unemployment rate has come down 6 percentage 
points  during the current expansion, suggest ing that the trend growth necessary to keep 
the unempl oyment rate unchanged has shifted down materially.  The median of FOMC 
participants’ projections  of this longer -run trend growth rate is  1.8 percent.  The latest 
estimate from the Blue -Chip consensus of private forecasters is about 2 percent .7 
To unpack this discussion a little further, we can think of output growth as 
composed of increases in hours worked and in output per hour, also known as 
productivity growth.  Here, a comparison with the 2001- to-2007 expansion is 
informative.  O utput growth in that ear lier expansion averaged nearly 3 percent per year, 
well above the pace in the current expansion.  Despite the faster output growth, however, 
average job growth in the early 2000s was 1/2 percentage point per year weaker than in 
the current expansion.  The difference, of course, is productivity, which grew at more 
than twice the pace in the early 2000s than it has in recent years.  
Taking a longer view, t he average pace of labor productivity growth since 2010 is 
the slowest since World War II and about one -fourth  of the  average postwar rate (figure 
10).  Moreover, the productivity growth slowdown seems to be global and is evident even 
in countries that were little affected by  the financial crisis (figure 11 ).  This  observation 
suggests that factors specific to the United States are probably not the main drivers.

 As shown in figure 12, labor productivity growth can be broken down into the 
contributions from business investment (or capital deepening), changes in the skills and 
work experience  of the workforce, and a residual component that is attributed to other 
factors such as technological change and  efficiency gains (usually lumped together under 
the term total factor or multifactor productivity).   
In the United States and in many other countries, some of the slowdown in labor 
productivity growth can be traced to weak investment after the crisis.  Investment has 
picked up recently in the United States, however, which suggest s that capital deepening 
may pick up as well.  The other big contributor to the slowdown has been in total factor 
productivity growth.  The outlook for this dimension of productivity is considerably more 
uncertain.  Total factor  productivity growth is notoriously difficult to predict, and there 
are sharply different views on where it might be heading.  Some argue that the 
productivity gains from the information technology revolution are largely behind us , and 
that more -recent technological innovations have less potential to boost productivity.8  
Others argue that a well -documented decline in measures of business dynamism --such as 
the number of start -ups, the closure of less -productive businesses, and the rates at which 
workers qui t their jobs and move around the country to take a new job--has held back 
productivity growth, in part by slowing the movement of capital and labor to ward their 
most productive uses .9

New technological breakthroughs in many areas --robotics, biotech, and ar tificial 
intelligence to name just a few --have led others to take a more optimistic view.10  They 
point to  substantial productivity gains from innovation in areas such as  energy production 
and e -commerce .  In addition, the optimists point out that advances in technology often 
take decades to work their way into the economy before their ultimate effects on 
productivity  are felt .  That delay has been observed even for game- changing in novations  
like the steam engine and electrification , which ultimately produce d broad increases in 
productivity and living standards.  In this view, we just need to be patient for new 
technologies to diffuse through the economy.  Only time will tell who has the better 
view --the record provides little basis to believe that we can accurately forecast the rate of 
increase in productivity.    
The other principal contributor to output growth is hours worked.  Hours growth, 
in turn, is largely determined by growth in the labor force, which has averaged just 1/2 
percent per year since 2010,  well below the average in previous decades (figure 13 ).  One 
reason for slower growth of the labor force is that baby boomers are aging and retiring , 
and that trend will continue.   But another reason is that labor force participation of people 
between the ages of 25 and 54--prime -age individuals --declined from 2010 to 2015 and 
remains low.  Indeed, t he participation rate for prime -age men has been falling for more 
than 50 years, while women’s participation in this age group rose through the 1990s but 
then turned downward, and it has fallen for the past 20 years.  
                                                 
10 See, for example, Erik Brynjolfsson, Daniel Rock, and Chad Syverson (2017), “Artificial Intelligence 
and the Modern Productivity Paradox:  A Clash of Expectations and Statistics,” NBER Working Paper 
Series 24001 (Cambridge, Mass.:  National Bureau of Economic Research, November) , 
www.nber.org/papers/w24001.   - 11 - 
These trends in participation have been more pronounced in the United States 
than in other advanced economies.  In 1990, the United States had relatively high 
participation rates for prime -age women  relative to other countries and was in the 
midrange of advanced economies for prime -age men.  However, we now stand at the low 
end of participation for both men and women in this age group--just above Italy, but well 
below Germany, France, a nd Spain (figure 14 ). 
There is no  consensus about the reasons for the long -term decline in prime -age 
participation rates, and  a variety of factors could have played a role. 11  For example, 
while automation and globalization have contributed positively to overall domesti c 
production and growth, adjustment to these developments has resulted in dislocations of  
many workers without college degrees  and those employed in manufacturing.  In 
addition, factors such as the increase in disability rolls in recent decades  and the opi oid 
crisis may have reduced the supply of prime -age workers.  G iven that the declines have 
been larger here than in other countries, it seems likely that factors specific to the United 
States have played an important role.  As I noted earlier, the strong e conomy may 
continue to pull some prime -age individuals back into the labor force and encourage 
others not to drop out.  R esearch suggests that structurally -oriented measures --for 
example, improving education or fighting the opioid crisis --also will help  raise labor 
force participation in this age group.12

To summarize this discussion, some of the factors weighing on longer -term 
growth are likely to be persistent, particularly the slowing in growth of the workforce.  
Others are hard to predict, such as produc tivity.   But as a nation, we are not bystanders.  
We can put policies in place that will support labor force participation and give us the 
best chance to achieve broad and sustained increases in productivity, and thus in living 
standards.  These policies are mostly outside the toolkit of the Federal Reserve, such as 
those  that support investment in education and workers ’ skills, business investment  and 
research and development, and investment in infrastructure .       
Monetary Policy  
Let me turn now to monetary policy.  In the aftermath of the financial crisis, the 
FOMC went to extraordinary lengths to promote the recovery, support job growth, and 
prevent inflation from falling too low.  A s the recovery advanced, it became appropriate 
to begin reducing  monetary policy support.  Since monetary policy affects the economy 
with a lag, waiting until inflation and employment hit our goals before reducing policy 
support could have led to a rise in inflation to unwelcome levels.  In such circum stances, 
monetary policy might need to tighten abruptly, which could disrupt the economy or even 
trigger a recession.  
As a result, to sustain the expansion, the FOMC adopted a gradual approach to 
reducing monetary policy support.  We began in December 2015 by raising our target for 
the federal funds rate for the first time in nearly a decade.  Since then, with the economy 
improving but inflation still below target and some slack remaining, the Committee has 
continued to gradually raise interest rates.  Thi s patient approach also reduced the risk 
that an unforeseen blow to the economy might push the federal funds rate back near  - 13 - 
zero--its effective lower bound--t hus limiting our ability to provide appropriate monetary 
accommodation.   
In addition, after caref ul planning and public  communication, last October the 
FOMC began to gradually and predictably reduce the size of the Fed’s balance sheet.  
Reducing our securities holdings is another way to move the stance of monetary policy 
toward neutral.  The balance s heet reduction process is going smoothly and is expected to 
contribute over time to a gradual tightening of financial conditions.  Over the next few 
years, the size of our balance sheet is expected to shrink significantly.  
At our meeting last month, the FO MC raised the target range for the federal funds 
rate by 1/4 percentage point, bringing it to 1- 1/2 to 1- 3/4 percent.  This decision marked 
another step in the ongoing process of gradually scaling back monetary policy 
accommodation.  The FOMC’s patient approach has paid dividends and contributed to 
the strong economy we have today.  
Over the next few years, we will continue to aim for 2 percent inflation and for a 
sustained economic expansion with a strong labor market.  As I mentioned, my FOMC  
colleagues and I believe that , as long as the economy continues broadly on its curr ent 
path, further gradual increases in the federal funds rate will best promote these goals.  It 
remains the case that raising rates too slowly wou ld make it necessary for  monetary 
policy to tighten abruptly down the road, which c ould jeopardize the economic 
expansion.  But raising rates too quickly would increase the risk that inflation would 
remain persistently below our 2 percent objective.  Our path of gradual rate increases is 
intended to balance these two risks.    - 14 - 
Of course, our views about appropriate monetary policy in the months and years 
ahead will be informed by incoming economic data and the evolving outlook.  If the 
outlook changes, so too will monetary policy.  Our overarching objective will remain th e 
same:  fostering a strong economy for all Americans --one that provides plentiful jobs and 
low and stable inflation. 1.  Unemployment is very low
2.  Payroll employment growth remains solid

Monetary Policy since the Onset of the Crisis

When we convened in Jackson Hole in August 2007, the Federal Open Market 
Committee’s (FOMC) target for th e federal funds rate was 5-1/4 percent.  Sixteen months 
later, with the financ ial crisis in full swing, the FOMC  had lowered the target for the 
federal funds rate to nearly zero, thereby en tering the unfamiliar te rritory of having to 
conduct monetary policy with th e policy interest rate at its effective lower bound.  The 
unusual severity of the recession and ongoing strains in financial markets made the 
challenges facing monetary pol icymakers all the greater. 
Today I will review the e volution of U.S. monetary policy since late 2007.  My 
focus will be the Federal Reserve’s experien ce with nontraditional policy tools, notably 
those based on the management of the Federa l Reserve’s balance sh eet and on its public 
communications.  I’ll discuss what we have le arned about the efficacy and drawbacks of 
these less familiar forms of monetary policy, a nd I’ll talk about the implications for the 
Federal Reserve’s ongoing efforts to promote a return to maximum employment in a 
context of price stability. 
Monetary Policy in 2007 and 2008    
When significant financial stresses firs t emerged, in August 2007, the FOMC 
responded quickly, first through liquidity acti ons--cutting the discount rate and extending 
term loans to banks--and then, in September, by lowering the target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points.
1  As further indications of economic weakness appeared over 
subsequent months, the Comm ittee reduced its target for the federal funds rate by a 
cumulative 325 basis points, leaving the targ et at 2 percent by the spring of 2008.  
                                                            
1 One basis point equals one-hundredth of 1 percentage point.   - 2 - 
 
 
 The Committee held rates constant over the summer as it monitored economic and 
financial conditions.  When the crisis inte nsified markedly in the fall, the Committee 
responded by cutting the target for the federa l funds rate by 100 basis points in October, 
with half of this easing coming as part of an unprecedented coordinated interest rate cut 
by six major central banks.  Then, in December 2008, as evidence of a dramatic slowdown mounted, the Committee reduced its targ et to a range of 0 to 25 basis points, 
effectively its lower bound.  That target range remains in place today.  
Despite the easing of moneta ry policy, dysfunction in cr edit markets continued to 
worsen.  As you know, in the latter part of  2008 and early 2009, the Federal Reserve took 
extraordinary steps to provide liquidity and support credit market  functioning, including 
the establishment of a number of emerge ncy lending facilities and the creation or 
extension of currency swap agreements with 14 central banks around the world.
2  In its 
role as banking regulator, the Federal Reserve al so led stress tests of the largest U.S. bank 
holding companies, setting the stage for the companies to raise capital.  These actions--
along with a host of interventions by othe r policymakers in the United States and 
throughout the world--helped stab ilize global financial markets,  which in turn served to 
check the deterioration in the real economy and the emergence of deflationary pressures.   
Unfortunately, although it is likely that  even worse outcomes had been averted, 
the damage to the economy was severe.  The unemployment rate in the United States rose 
from about 6 percent in September 2008 to n early 9 percent by Apr il 2009--it would peak 
at 10 percent in October--while inflation declined sharply.  As  the crisis crested, and with

 the federal funds rate at its  effective lower bound, the FOMC  turned to nontraditional 
policy approaches to support the recovery. 
As the Committee embarked on this pat h, we were guided by some general 
principles and some insightful academic work  but--with the important exception of the 
Japanese case--limited historical  experience.  As a result, central bankers in the United 
States, and those in other advanced economies facing similar problems, have been in the 
process of learning by doing.  I will discuss some of what we have learned, beginning 
with our experience conducting policy using the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, then 
turn to our use of communications tools.   
Balance Sheet Tools 
In using the Federal Reserve’s balance sh eet as a tool for achieving its mandated 
objectives of maximum employ ment and price stability,  the FOMC has focused on the 
acquisition of longer-term securi ties--specifically, Treasury a nd agency securities, which 
are the principal types of securities that the Federal Reserve is permitted to buy under the 
Federal Reserve Act.3  One mechanism through which such purchases are believed to 
affect the economy is the so-called portfolio balance channel, which is based on the ideas 
of a number of well-known monetary ec onomists, including James Tobin, Milton 
Friedman, Franco Modigliani, Karl Brunne r, and Allan Meltzer.  The key premise 
underlying this channel is that, for a variety of reasons, different classes of financial 
                                                            
3 Agency securities are securities issued by the gove rnment-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) and include both 
mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by GSEs an d GSE debt.  Since August 2008, Fannie Mae and 
Freddie Mac have been in government conservatorship wi th capital support provided by the U.S. Treasury. 
The Federal Reserve's net acquisitions of securities are financed by the creation of commercial bank 
reserves, which in turn are held in  accounts at the Federal Reserve. (*The text of this footnote has been 
revised since its original release.)  - 4 - 
 
 
 assets are not perfect substitutes in investors’ portfolios.4  For example, some institutional 
investors face regulatory rest rictions on the types of secu rities they can hold, retail 
investors may be reluctant to hold certain types of assets be cause of high transactions or 
information costs, and some assets have risk ch aracteristics that are difficult or costly to 
hedge. 
Imperfect substitutability of assets implie s that changes in the supplies of various 
assets available to private i nvestors may affect the prices and yields of those assets.  
Thus, Federal Reserve purchases of mortga ge-backed securities (MBS), for example, 
should raise the prices and lowe r the yields of those securities; moreover, as investors 
rebalance their portfolios by re placing the MBS sold to the Federal Reserve with other 
assets, the prices of the asse ts they buy should rise and th eir yields decline as well.  
Declining yields and rising asset prices eas e overall financial c onditions and stimulate 
economic activity through channels similar to  those for conventiona l monetary policy.  
Following this logic, Tobin suggested that purchases of longer-t erm securities by the 
Federal Reserve during the Great Depressi on could have helped the U.S. economy 
recover despite the fact that short-term rate s were close to zero, and Friedman argued for 
large-scale purchases of long-term bonds by the Bank of Japan to help overcome Japan’s deflationary trap.

Schwartz (1982).  Ne lson (2011) discusses the relevance of Fr iedman’s views for r ecent Federal Reserve 
policy.  For modern treatments of the portfolio bala nce channel in a macroecono mic context, see Andrés, 
López-Salido, and Nelson (2004).  The portfolio balance channel would be inoperative under various strong assumptions that I view as empirically implausible, such as complete and frictionless financial 
markets and full internalization by private investor s of the government’s ba lance sheet (Ricardian 
equivalence).  
5 See Tobin (1965) and Friedman (2000). - 5 - 
 
 
 Large-scale asset purchases can influen ce financial conditions and the broader 
economy through other channels as well.  For instance, they can signal that the central 
bank intends to pursue a persistently more  accommodative policy stance than previously 
thought, thereby lowering investor s’ expectations for the future path of the federal funds 
rate and putting additional downward pressure on long-term interest rates, particularly in 
real terms.  Such signaling can also increase household and business confidence by 
helping to diminish concerns about “tail” risks such as deflation.  During stressful 
periods, asset purchases may also improve th e functioning of financial markets, thereby 
easing credit conditions in some sectors.  
 With the space for further cuts in the targ et for the federal funds rate increasingly 
limited, in late 2008 the Federal Reserve initiate d a series of large-scale asset purchases 
(LSAPs).  In November, the FOMC announ ced a program to purchase a total of 
$600 billion in agency MBS and agency debt.6  In March 2009, the FOMC expanded this 
purchase program substantially, announcing that  it would purchase up to $1.25 trillion of 
agency MBS, up to $200 billion of agency debt, and up to $300 billion of longer-term 
Treasury debt.7  These purchases were completed, with minor adjustments, in early 
2010.8  In November 2010, the FOMC announ ced that it would further expand the 
Federal Reserve’s security holdings by purch asing an additional $600 billion of longer-
term Treasury securities ove r a period ending in mid-2011.9

7 See Board of Governors (2009).    
8 Several months later, to avoid an implicit tightening in policy associated with the runoff of maturing 
securities, the Federal Reserve also began reinvestin g the principal payments received on agency MBS and 
debt into Treasury securities and continued to roll over maturing longer-term Treasury debt.  See Board of 
Governors (2010a). 
9 See Board of Governors (2010b). - 6 - 
 
 
 About a year ago, the FOMC introduced  a variation on its earlier purchase 
programs, known as the maturity extension program (MEP), under which the Federal Reserve would purchase $400 billion of long- term Treasury securi ties and sell an 
equivalent amount of shorter-term Treasury securities over the period ending in June 
2012.
10  The FOMC subsequently extended the MEP through the end of this year.11  By 
reducing the average maturity of the s ecurities held by the public, the MEP puts 
additional downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and further eases overall 
financial conditions.   
How effective are balance sheet policies?  After nearly four years of experience 
with large-scale asset purchases, a substantia l body of empirical work  on their effects has 
emerged.  Generally, this research finds that  the Federal Reserve’s large-scale purchases 
have significantly lowered long-term Treasur y yields.  For example, studies have found 
that the $1.7 trillion in purcha ses of Treasury and agency se curities under the first LSAP 
program reduced the yield on 10-year Treasury securities by between 40 and 110 basis 
points.  The $600 billion in Treasury purchases  under the second LSAP program has been 
credited with lowering 10-year yields by an additional 15 to 45 basis points.12  Three 
studies considering the cumula tive influence of all the Fede ral Reserve’s asset purchases, 
including those made under the MEP, found to tal effects between 80 and 120 basis points 
on the 10-year Treasury yield.13  These effects are economically meaningful.

and agency MBS into agency MBS.  See Board of Governors (2011a).

 Importantly, the effects of LSAPs do not a ppear to be confined to longer-term 
Treasury yields.  Notably, LSAPs have been  found to be associated with significant 
declines in the yields on both corporate bonds and MBS.14  The first purchase program, in 
particular, has been linked to substantial re ductions in MBS yields and retail mortgage 
rates.  LSAPs also appear to have boos ted stock prices, presumably both by lowering 
discount rates and by improving the economic outlook; it is probabl y not a coincidence 
that the sustained recovery in U.S. equity  prices began in March 2009, shortly after the 
FOMC’s decision to greatly expand securities purchases.  This e ffect is potentially 
important because stock values affect bot h consumption and investment decisions.  
While there is substantial evidence that the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases 
have lowered longer-term yields and eased broader financial condi tions, obtaining precise 
estimates of the effects of these operations on the broader economy is inherently difficult, 
as the counterfactual--how the economy woul d have performed in the absence of the 
Federal Reserve’s actions--cannot be directly observed.  If we are willing to take as a 
working assumption that the effects of eas ier financial conditions on the economy are 
similar to those observed historically, then econometric models can be used to estimate 
the effects of LSAPs on the economy.  Mode l simulations conducted at the Federal 
                                                                                                                                                                                   
arbitrage model of the term structure of interest rates and time-series data from 1994 to 2007 to estimate the 
effects on term premiums of changes in the amount of longer-term Treasury debt and agency MBS held by 
the public.  Using this model, Li and Wei are able to  infer the effects of the two LSAP programs and the 
MEP, controlling for changes in the expected path of the federal funds rate and its implications for long-term interest rates.  Their analysis suggests that the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases are an important 
factor underlying the current very low level of the term premium in longer-term rates.    
14 On corporate bonds, see Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jørgensen (2011) and Wright (2012); Fuster and 
Willen (2010), Hancock and Passmore (2011), and Wright (2012) report results on mortgage yields.  Early 
skeptics of balance sheet policies worried that any ef fects on Treasury yields would not be transmitted to 
other interest rates and asset prices.  The evidence report ed in these papers refutes this concern, as does the 
fact that spreads of investment-gra de corporate bond yields and mortga ge rates over comparable-maturity 
Treasury yields were not elevated from late 2009  through mid-2011; those spreads have since risen 
somewhat, reflecting in part concerns about the Euro pean situation and the pace of the U.S. economic 
recovery.  - 8 - 
 
 
 Reserve generally find that the securities purchase programs have provided significant 
help for the economy.  For example, a study using the Board’s FRB/US model of the 
economy found that, as of 2012, the first two rou nds of LSAPs may have raised the level 
of output by almost 3 percent and increased private payroll employment by more than 2 
million jobs, relative to what otherwise would have occurred.15  The Bank of England has 
used LSAPs in a manner similar to that of the Federal Reserve, so it is of interest that researchers have found the financial and m acroeconomic effects of the British programs 
to be qualitatively similar to those in the United States.
16 
To be sure, these estimates of the macroeconomic effects of LSAPs should be 
treated with caution.  It is lik ely that the crisis and the re cession have attenuated some of 
the normal transmission channels of monetary policy relative to what is assumed in the 
models; for example, restrictive mortgage  underwriting standards have reduced the 
effects of lower mortgage rates.  Further,  the estimated macroeconomic effects depend on 
uncertain estimates of the persistence of the effects of LSAPs on financial conditions.17  
Overall, however, a balanced reading of th e evidence supports the c onclusion that central 
bank securities purchases have provided m eaningful support to the economic recovery 
while mitigating deflationary risks.  
                                                            
15 See Chung and others (2012) for details of assumptions and simulation results.  Focusing only on the 
second LSAP program, Fuhrer and Olivei (2011) find co mparable effects, attributing to that program a bit 
less than a 1 percent increase in output and 700,000 new jobs.  Using different methodologies, Kiley (2012) 
finds significantly smaller effect s and Baumeister and Benati (201 0) find larger effects.   
16 Joyce, Tong, and Woods (2011) summarize a range of estimates of the macr oeconomic effects of the 
Bank of England’s quantitative easing program, which, relative to size of the U.K. economy, is roughly 
equivalent in scale to the Federal Reserve’s two LSAP programs.  Those estimates suggest a peak effect of 1-1/2 to 2 percent for real output and between 3/4 and 1-1/2 percent for inflation in the United Kingdom.  
See also Baumeister and Benati (2010) and Christensen and Rudebusch (2012).  
17 For example, while the macroecono mic effects reported by Chung and others (2012) are consistent with 
the persistence of financial effects as estimated by Li and Wei (2012), Wright (2012) finds much less 
persistence using a different methodology.  Kiley (2012) also provides arguments and evidence for why 
LSAPs may have been less stimulative than found in Chung and others (2012) and Fuhrer and Olivei (2011). - 9 - 
 
 
 Now I will turn to our use of communications tools.   
Communication Tools 
Clear communication is always importa nt in central ba nking, but it can be 
especially important when economic conditions  call for further policy stimulus but the 
policy rate is already at it s effective lower bound.  In part icular, forward guidance that 
lowers private-sector expecta tions regarding future short-te rm rates should cause longer-
term interest rates to decline, leadi ng to more accommodative financial conditions.18    
The Federal Reserve has made considerab le use of forward guidance as a policy 
tool.19  From March 2009 through June 2011, the FOMC’s postmeeting statement noted 
that economic conditions “are likely to warrant  exceptionally low levels of the federal 
funds rate for an extended period.”20  At the August 2011 meeting, the Committee made 
its guidance more precise by st ating that economic conditions  would likely warrant that 
the federal funds rate remain excep tionally low “at least through mid-2013.”21  At the 
beginning of this year, the FOMC extended the anticipated period of exceptionally low 
rates further, to “at least through late 2014,” guidance that has been reaffirmed at 
subsequent meetings.22  As the language indicates, this  guidance is not an unconditional 
promise; rather, it is a statement about the FOMC’s collective judgment regarding the 
                                                            
18 See Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) and Levin and others (2010) for discussions of the role of 
communication at the zero lower bound. 
19 As with asset purchases, the Federal Reserve has not been alone in using forward policy guidance.  The 
Bank of Canada, for example, announced in April 2009 its intention to hold the overnight policy at 25 basis 
points through the second quarter of 2010; this conditional guidance was subject to the bank’s assessment of future inflation trends.  The Bank of Japan has long provided forward guidance linking policy to 
economic developments.  In March 2001, for example, the Bank of Japan committed to maintain its policy 
rate at zero until Japanese consumer prices stabilized or exhibited a year-on-year increase.  The Riksbank 
and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand in recent years ha ve made statements about the future course of the 
policy rate similar to those provided by the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada.

 path of policy that is likely  to prove appropriate, given th e Committee’s objectives and its 
outlook for the economy.   
The views of Committee members regardi ng the likely timing of policy firming 
represent a balance of many factors, but the current forward guidance is broadly 
consistent with prescriptions coming from a range of standard benchmarks, including 
simple policy rules and optimal control methods.23  Some of the policy rules informing 
the forward guidance relate policy interest rate s to familiar determinants, such as inflation 
and the output gap.  But a number of consideratio ns also argue for planning to keep rates 
low for a longer time than implied by policy rules developed during more normal periods.  
These considerations include the need to ta ke out insurance agains t the realization of 
downside risks, which are particularly difficu lt to manage when rates are close to their 
effective lower bound; the possibility that, be cause of various unusual headwinds slowing 
the recovery, the economy needs more policy support than usual at  this stage of the cycle; 
and the need to compensate for limits to policy accommodation resulting from the lower 
bound on rates.24  
Has the forward guidance been effective?  It is certainly true  that, over time, both 
investors and private forecasters have pushed out considerably the date at which they 
expect the federal funds rate to begin to rise; moreover, current policy expectations 
appear to align well with the FOMC’s forwar d guidance.  To be sure, the changes over 
time in when the private sector expects the fe deral funds rate to begin firming resulted in 
                                                            
23 Yellen (2012a, 2012b) provides details on the current forward guidance. 
24 On responding to unusual headwind s (technically, a situation in which a lower real interest rate is 
required to achieve full employment), see Williams (2009).  On risk management near the zero lower bound, see Orphanides and Wiel and (2000).  On compensating for limits to policy accommodation 
attributable to the lower bound on rates, see Reifschneider and Williams (2000).  Another argument for 
sustaining low rates follows because optimal policies may involve a slow, or  “inertial,” adjustment of rates; 
see, for example, Woodford (2003). - 11 - 
 
 
 part from the same deterioration of the ec onomic outlook that led the FOMC to introduce 
and then extend its forward guidance.  But the private sector’s revised outlook for the 
policy rate also appears to reflect a growing appreciation of how forceful the FOMC 
intends to be in supporting a sustainable re covery.  For example, since 2009, forecasters 
participating in the Blue Chip survey have repeatedly marked down their projections of 
the unemployment rate they expect to prevail at the time that the FOMC begins to lift the 
target for the federal funds rate away from zero.  Thus, the Committee’s forward 
guidance may have conveyed a greater willingness to maintain accommodation than private forecasters had previously believed.
25  The behavior of financial market prices in 
periods around changes in the forward guidance is  also consistent with  the view that the 
guidance has affected policy expectations.26 
Making Policy with Nontraditional Tools:  A Cost-Benefit Framework   
Making monetary policy with nontraditional tools is challenging.  In particular, 
our experience with these tools remains limite d.  In this context, the FOMC carefully 
compares the expected benefits a nd costs of proposed policy actions. 
The potential benefit of policy action, of course, is the possibility of better 
economic outcomes--outcomes more consistent with the FOMC’s dual mandate.  In light 
                                                            
25 In October 2009, private forecasters in the Blue Chip  survey projected that the unemployment rate would 
be near 10 percent and overall inflation as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) would be 2 percent 
at the time that short-term interest rates (three-month Treasury bill rates) rose above 50 basis points.  By 
March 2011, forecasters had lowered the projected unemployment rate at  the policy liftoff date to about 
8-1/2 percent, again accompanied by inflation near 2 percent.  And by March 2012, forecasters projected 
that the unemployment rate would have fallen below 7-1/2 percent, and that CPI inflation would be moving up to close to 2-1/2 percent, before short-term intere st rates would rise appreciab ly above the current target 
range. 
26 For example, Board staff members have performed event studies of the movement in Eurodollar futures 
prices and other financial variables immediately followi ng the release of the August 2011 and January 2012 
FOMC statements.  In both cases, the provision of specific guidance about the likely date of liftoff was 
associated with a noticeable flattening of the expected path of the federal funds rate.  For a formal analysis 
of the effectiveness of the FOMC’s forwar d guidance, see Swanson and Williams (2012). - 12 - 
 
 
 of the evidence I discussed, it appears reasonable to conclude that nontraditional policy 
tools have been and can con tinue to be effective in pr oviding financial accommodation, 
though we are less certain about the magnitude and persistence of th ese effects than we 
are about those of more-traditional policies.    The possible benefits of an action, howe ver, must be considered alongside its 
potential costs.  I will focus now on the potential costs of LSAPs.   
One possible cost of conducting additiona l LSAPs is that th ese operations could 
impair the functioning of securities markets.  As I noted, the Federal Reserve is limited 
by law mainly to the purchase of Treasury and agency securities;  the supply of those 
securities is large but finite, and not all of the supply is actively trad ed.  Conceivably, if 
the Federal Reserve became too dominant a buyer in certain segments of these markets, trading among private agents could dry up, de grading liquidity and price discovery.  As 
the global financial system depends on d eep and liquid markets for U.S. Treasury 
securities, significant impairme nt of those markets would be  costly, and, in particular, 
could impede the transmission of monetary policy.  For example, market disruptions 
could lead to higher liquidity premiums on Treasury securities, which would run counter 
to the policy goal of reducing Treasury yields .  However, although market capacity could 
ultimately become an issue, to this point we have seen few if any problems in the markets for Treasury or agency securities, private-sect or holdings of securities remain large, and 
trading among private market participants remains robust. 
A second potential cost of additional secu rities purchases is that substantial 
further expansions of the balance sheet could reduce public confidence in the Fed’s 
ability to exit smoothly from its accommodative po licies at the appropriate time.  Even if - 13 - 
 
 
 unjustified, such a reduction in confidence might increase the risk of a costly unanchoring 
of inflation expectations, lead ing in turn to financial and economic instability.  It is 
noteworthy, however, that the e xpansion of the balance sheet to date has not materially 
affected inflation expectations, likely in pa rt because of the great emphasis the Federal 
Reserve has placed on developing tools to ensu re that we can normalize monetary policy 
when appropriate, even if our securities holdings remain larg e.  In particular, the FOMC 
will be able to put upward pressure on short-te rm interest rates by raising the interest rate 
it pays banks for reserves they hold at the Fed.  Upward pressure on rates can also be 
achieved by using reserve-dr aining tools or by selling s ecurities from the Federal 
Reserve’s portfolio, thus reversing the effect s achieved by LSAPs.  The FOMC has spent 
considerable effort planning and testing our exit strategy and will act decisively to execute it at the appropriate time.  
A third cost to be weighed is that of ri sks to financial stability.  For example, 
some observers have raised concerns th at, by driving longer-term yields lower, 
nontraditional policies could induce an imprude nt reach for yield by some investors and 
thereby threaten financial st ability.  Of course, one objec tive of both traditional and 
nontraditional policy during recoveries is to prom ote a return to productive risk-taking; as 
always, the goal is to strike the appropriate balance.  More over, a stronger recovery is 
itself clearly helpful for financial stability.  In assessing this risk, it is important to note that the Federal Reserve, both on its own and in collaboration with other members of the 
Financial Stability Oversight Council, has s ubstantially expanded its monitoring of the 
financial system and modified its supervis ory approach to take a more systemic 
perspective.  We have seen li ttle evidence thus far of unsafe buildups of risk or leverage, - 14 - 
 
 
 but we will continue both our careful oversight and the implementation of financial 
regulatory reforms aimed at re ducing systemic risk.   
A fourth potential cost of balance sheet pol icies is the possibility that the Federal 
Reserve could incur financial lo sses should interest rates rise  to an unexpected extent.  
Extensive analyses suggest that, from a purely fi scal perspective, the odds are strong that 
the Fed’s asset purchases will make money for the taxpayers, reducing the federal deficit and debt.
27  And, of course, to the extent that  monetary policy helps strengthen the 
economy and raise incomes, the benefits for the U.S. fiscal position would be substantial.  
In any case, this purely fiscal  perspective is too narrow:  Because Americans are workers 
and consumers as well as taxpayers, mone tary policy can achieve the most for the 
country by focusing generally on improving eco nomic performance rather than narrowly 
on possible gains or losses on the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. 
In sum, both the benefits and costs of nontraditional monetary policies are 
uncertain; in all likelihood, they will also vary over time, depending on factors such as 
the state of the economy and financial market s and the extent of prior Federal Reserve 
asset purchases.  Moreover, nontraditional pol icies have potential costs that may be less 
relevant for traditional policies.  For thes e reasons, the hurdle for using nontraditional 
policies should be higher than for traditional policies.  At the same time, the costs of 
nontraditional policies, when considered care fully, appear manageable, implying that we 
should not rule out the further use of su ch policies if economic conditions warrant.

 Economic Prospects  
The accommodative monetary policies I have reviewed today, both traditional and 
nontraditional, have provided important support to the economic recovery while helping to maintain price stability.  As of July, the unemployment rate had fallen to 8.3 percent 
from its cyclical peak of 10 percent and payr olls had risen by 4 million jobs from their 
low point.  And despite periodic concerns about deflation risks, on the one hand, and 
repeated warnings that excessive policy  accommodation would ignite inflation, on the 
other hand, inflation (except for temporary deviations caused primarily by swings in 
commodity prices) has remained near the Co mmittee’s 2 percent objective and inflation 
expectations have remained stable.  Key sectors such as manufacturing, housing, and 
international trade have strengthened, firms’  investment in equipment and software has 
rebounded, and conditions in financial and credit markets have improved.     
Notwithstanding these positive signs, the economic situation is obviously far from 
satisfactory.  The unemployment rate remains mo re than 2 percentage  points above what 
most FOMC participants see as  its longer-run normal value, and other indicators--such as 
the labor force participation rate and th e number of people working part time for 
economic reasons--confirm that labor force utilization remains at very low levels.  
Further, the rate of improvement in the labor  market has been painfully slow.  I have 
noted on other occasions that the declines in unemployment we have seen would likely 
continue only if economic growth picked up to a rate above its longer-term trend.
28  In 
fact, growth in recent quarte rs has been tepid, and so, not surprisingly, we have seen no 
net improvement in the unemployment rate si nce January.  Unless the economy begins to 
                                                            
28 See Bernanke (2012). - 16 - 
 
 
 grow more quickly than it has recently, the unemployment rate is likely to remain far 
above levels consistent with ma ximum employment for some time.  
In light of the policy actions the FOMC  has taken to date, as well as the 
economy’s natural recovery mechanisms, we might have hoped for greater progress by 
now in returning to maximum employment.  Some have taken the lack of progress as 
evidence that the financial crisis caused stru ctural damage to the economy, rendering the 
current levels of unemployment impervious  to additional monetary accommodation.  The 
literature on this issue is extensive,  and I cannot fully review it today.29  However, 
following every previous U.S. recession sin ce World War II, the unemployment rate has 
returned close to its pre-recession level,  and, although the recent recession was unusually 
deep, I see little evidence of substantial structural change in recent years. 
Rather than attributing the slow recovery to longer-ter m structural factors, I see 
growth being held back curre ntly by a number of headwinds.  First, although the housing 
sector has shown signs of improvement, housi ng activity remains at low levels and is 
contributing much less to the recovery than w ould normally be expected at this stage of 
the cycle.  
Second, fiscal policy, at both the federal a nd state and local levels, has become an 
important headwind for the pace of economic growth.  Notwithstanding some recent improvement in tax revenues, state and local governments still face tight budget 
situations and continue to cu t real spending and employment .  Real purchases are also 
declining at the federal level.  Uncertain ties about fiscal polic y, notably about the 
resolution of the so-called fis cal cliff and the lifting of th e debt ceiling, are probably also 
                                                            
29 See Daly and others (2011) for an overview. - 17 - 
 
 
 restraining activity, although the magnitudes of thes e effects are hard to judge.30  It is 
critical that fiscal policymakers put in place a credible plan that sets the federal budget on 
a sustainable trajectory in the medium a nd longer runs.  However, policymakers should 
take care to avoid a sharp near-term fiscal contraction that could endanger the recovery. 
Third, stresses in credit and financial ma rkets continue to restrain the economy.  
Earlier in the recovery, limited credit availa bility was an importan t factor holding back 
growth, and tight borrowing conditions fo r some potential homebuyers and small 
businesses remain a problem today.  More recently, however, a major source of financial strains has been uncertainty about developm ents in Europe.  These strains are most 
problematic for the Europeans, of course, but  through global trade a nd financial linkages, 
the effects of the European s ituation on the U.S. economy are significant as well.  Some 
recent policy proposals in Europe have been qu ite constructive, in my view, and I urge 
our European colleagues to press ahead with  policy initiatives to resolve the crisis. 
Conclusion 
 Early in my tenure as a member of the Bo ard of Governors, I gave a speech that 
considered options for monetary policy when th e short-term policy interest rate is close to 
its effective lower bound.
31  I was reacting to common assertions at the time that 
monetary policymakers would be “out of a mmunition” as the federal funds rate came 
closer to zero.  I argued that, to the contrary, policy could s till be effective near the lower 
bound.  Now, with several year s of experience with nontrad itional policies both in the 
United States and in other advanced economie s, we know more about how such policies

Bloom, and Davis (2012).

 work.  It seems clear, based on this experience,  that such policies can be effective, and 
that, in their absence, the 2007-09 recession would have been deeper and the current 
recovery would have been slower than has actually occurred. 
As I have discussed today, it is also true  that nontraditional po licies are relatively 
more difficult to apply, at leas t given the present state of our  knowledge.  Estimates of the 
effects of nontraditional policies on economic ac tivity and inflation are uncertain, and the 
use of nontraditional policies involves cost s beyond those generally associated with 
more-standard policies.  Consequently, the bar for the use of nontraditional policies is 
higher than for traditional policies.  In a ddition, in the present context, nontraditional 
policies share the limitations of monetary po licy more generally:  Monetary policy cannot 
achieve by itself what a broader and more  balanced set of economic policies might 
achieve; in particular, it cannot neutralize the fiscal and financial risks that the country 
faces.  It certainly cannot fine-tune economic outcomes. 
 As we assess the benefits and costs of  alternative policy ap proaches, though, we 
must not lose sight of the daunting economic  challenges that confront our nation.  The 
stagnation of the labor market in particular  is a grave concern not only because of the 
enormous suffering and waste of human talent it entails, but also because persistently 
high levels of unemployment will wreak structural damage on our economy that could last for many years.   
Over the past five years, the Federa l Reserve has acted to support economic 
growth and foster job creation, and it is important to achieve further progress, particularly 
in the labor market.  Taking due account of the uncertainties and limits of its policy tools, 
the Federal Reserve will provide additional policy accommodation as needed to promote - 19 - 
 
 
 a stronger economic recovery and sustained im provement in labor market conditions in a 
context of price stability. - 20 -

Council on Foreign Relations

January 20, 2023  
 T
hank you, Ben,  and thank you to the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) for 
inviting me to be part of this discussion.  It has been close to  a year since the Federal 
Open Market Committee (FOMC) began tightening monetary policy.  We began raising 
interest rates in March 2022 and shrinking our securities holdings in June in order to bring inflation down to our 2 percent target.
1  Today I thought I would spend a few 
minutes tak ing stock of the year behind us and talking about what’s next.   
A year ago , inflation was elevated and rapidly accelerating, and the Fed moved to 
quickly and dramatically  tighten monetary policy.  A t the end of December , the federal 
funds rate target was set in a range of 4 .25 percent to 4.5 percent, the highest in 15 years.  
Economic activity, meanwhile, has been holding up well.  After shrinking slightly in the first half of 2022, real gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 3.2 percent in the third quarter, and monthly data suggest it grew around 2 percent in the fourth quarter.  I 
expect such  slowing to continue in this quarter, which is both expected and desirable in 
our ongoing fight to lower inflation.   
The FOMC’s  goal in raising interest rates is to  dampen demand and economic 
activity  to support further reduc tions in inflation .  And t here is ample evidence that this is 
exactly what is going on in the business sector.  On the manufacturing side,  industrial 
production declined for the second  month in December.  And  the Institute for Supply 
Management ’s (ISM) for ward -looking indicators of orders and customers’ inventory 
suggested that further weakening is in train.   Meanwhile, the ISM survey for 
nonmanufacturing businesses, which had reported expansion since April of last year, 
1 The FOMC c ommunicated its i ntentions f or some t ime before M arch, a nd this guidance e ffectively began 
monetary policy tightening before raising rates and beginning the tapering  of asset purchases that mo nth.  
The v iews expressed here are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleag ues on th e FOMC.  -2 -
indicated a slight contract ion in De cember.  This slowdown in services activity was 
widespread, affecting 11 of 17 sectors in the survey, with significant slowdowns in 
construction and real estate, two industries heavily affected by higher interest rates.  This slowing in business activity i s consistent with t he FOMC’s goal of damp ing demand and 
reducing production so that it is in  better alignment with the productive capacity of the 
economy.  The goal is not, I would emphasize, to halt economic activity, and so we will be watching these sectors closely to see how this moderation continues.   
Growth in consumer spending has also begun to slow.  While that growth was 
surprisingly strong through most of the second half of 2022, nom inal personal 
consumption expenditures growth slowed to 0.1 percent in November, and retail sales fell 1 percent.  We don’t have spending data on goods and services for December, but retail sales fell another 1.1 percent.  While the latest readings of cons umer sentiment from the 
University of Michigan moved up some from historic lows, I continue to expect that last year’s decline in real incomes , along with higher borrowing costs, will moderate 
consumer spending this year and  help return inflation more promptly to the FOMC’s 2 
percent target.   Job one is maintaining  the progress we are making in lowering inflation, 
and moderation in consumer spending will support that progress. 
The slowing in output growth has occurred alongside the continuing strength of 
the labor market.  Total nonfarm employment grew 223,000 in December, close to the 
average of 237,000 a month for the fourth quarter.  That is down quite a bit from the monthly  increase of 539,000 in the first quarter of 2022 but still a solid growth rate, far 
above the number of new jobs needed to keep pace with population growth.  Employment  - 3 - 
grew robustly in the leisure and health -care sectors, where labor shortages are reportedly  
severe.   
While the labor market is strong, it is also tight.  The unemployment rate was 3.5 
percent in December , matching the low reached before the pandemic, and the lowest in 
53 years.  But there are signs that demand for labor is moderating.  J ob openings reported 
in the November Job Openings and Labor Tur nover Survey and job postings from 
December ’s Indeed data are down from their recent peak s.  Temporary- help employment, 
which has sometimes been a leading indicator for overall employment, has declined in 
recent months , but that decrease may be due at leas t in part to employers opting to hire 
full-time workers in place of temps to help keep jobs filled.  
A robust labor market, despite modest economic growth, is a plus for workers and 
allows the Fed  to focus on lower ing inflation.  It shows that jobs  and income can hold up 
to the effects of higher interest rates , help ing the FOMC  continue its efforts to lower 
inflation to our 2 percent goal by further tightening monetary policy.  
A potential downside of a tight labor market is if labor costs , which heavily 
influence inflation, grow so fast t hat they  slow progress toward the FOMC’s 2 percent 
objective.  Wages and other measures of compensation accelerated as inflation surged in the second half of 2021 and wage growth remained high in 2022.  But a s overall inflation 
has begun to moderate in recent months, so ha ve some measures of growth in wages and 
other compensation.  For example, t he 12- month increase in average hourly earnings hit a 
recent peak of 5.6 percent in March ( which is when the Fed began raising interest rates) 
and has been falling gradually and fairly steadily since then, reaching an annual ra te of 
4.6 percent in December.  The 3- month annualized change in average hourly earnings — - 4 - 
4.1 percent  in December —is running below the 12- month rate and is thus a signal of 
ongoing moderation.  These are encouraging signs, but we need to see continued 
impro vement across various measures of labor costs, because additional moderation is 
needed to bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal and because a significant  escalation 
in wage growth could drive up longer -range i nflation expectations .  Those longer -range 
expectations  have been fairly s table through this period of very high inflation, and we 
want it to stay that way because escalating expectations could drive inflation higher.  
Let me turn now to the outlook for inflation.  Last week’s report on the Consumer 
Price Index (CPI) showed that inflation continued to moderate in December, which was 
very welcome news.  First, I am going to spell out why this was such good news, and then I am goi ng to turn around and explain why I am still cautious about  the inflation 
outlook and supportive of continued monetary policy tightening. 
Overall headline inflation fell a tenth of a percent month over month in 
December, the first monthly drop since May 2020.  The 12- month change  in inflation 
peak ed at 9 percent i n June, and  has fallen every month since, t o 6.5 percent in 
December.    
A big factor in  the monthly decline in headline inflation in December  was a 
significant drop in energy prices, which more than offset a n increase in food price s.  The 
FOMC targets head line inflation because food and energy are considerable expenses for 
most people, but they are more volatile than other components of the index, and by factoring them out, “core” inflation c an provide a picture of where inflation is headed .  
Here also, we are seeing some progress.  Y early core inflation was down in December to 
5.7 percent, from 6 percent in November and a peak of 6.6 percent in September.  Over   - 5 - 
the past three months, core CPI inflation has run at an annualized rate of 3.1 percent , a 
noticeable drop from earlier in 2022.   
Another encouraging sign is that higher inflation was less concentrated—the share 
of categories of different goods and services with  inflation over 3 percent has declined in 
the past several months, from almost three fourths  in early 2022 to less than one half  in 
December .  That ’s good news because it indicates that broader inflationary pressure 
across the economy is easing. 
Now, here ’s why I am cautious about these latest res ults and why I am not ready 
yet to substantially alter my outlook for inflation.  Month- over-month c ore CPI inflation 
actually ticked up in December from November and is pretty much where it was in 
October  and where it was in March when we began raising interest rates .  Although 
inflation measured over 12 months has been falling, December’s reading is still close to 
where it was a year ago.   Core inflation was 6 percent year over year (YOY) in January 
2022 and was 5.7 percent  YOY last month .  Thus, it basic ally moved sideways all year.   
So, while it is possible to take a month or three months of data and paint a rosy picture , I 
caution against doing so.  T he shorter the trend, the larger the grain of salt when 
swallowing a story about the future.  Back in 2021 , we saw three consecutive months of 
relatively low readings of core inflation before it jumped back up.  We do not want to be head -faked.  I will be looking for the recent improvement in headline and core inflation to 
continue . 
Wages, as I indicated earlier, are another stream of data that I will be watching for 
evidence of continued progress to help ease overall inflation.  Though recent hourly earnings  data are a positive development, I need to see more evidence of wage  - 6 - 
moderation to sustainable leve ls.  The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s Wage G rowth 
Tracker has been running higher lately and has moderated less.  The employment cost 
index for December  won’t be out until the end of this  month.  Over time, we need to see 
wages grow more in line with productivity growth plus 2 percentage points , consistent 
with the FOMC’s inflation target . 
Those are reasons that I am cautious about the recent good news, but it is good 
news.  We have made progress.  Six months ago, when inflation was escalating and 
econ omic output had flattened, I argued that a soft landing was still possible —that it was 
quite plausible  to make progress on inflation without seriously damaging the  labor 
market.  S o far, we have managed to do so, and  I remain optimistic that this progress can 
continue .   
I believe that monetary policy should continue to tighten, but using a comparison 
I employed in a speech a couple months ago, the view from the cockpit  is very different 
at 30,000 feet tha n it is c lose to the ground.  When the FOMC began raising the federal 
funds rate last spring from near zero, it made sense to move quickly.  But after front -
loading monetary policy tightening, with many unprecedented  75 basis point  hikes  in the 
federal funds rate t arget , by early December I believed the policy stance was slightly 
restrictive , and I supported a decision by the Committee to hike  by a still considerable 50 
basis points.2  To return to the airplane image, after climbing steeply and using monetary 
polic y to significantly raise interest rates throughout the economy, it was apparent to me 
that it was time to  slow, but not halt, the rate of ascent.   
 
2 Each 75 basis point  hike was the largest rate single increase since the FOMC began announcing its rate 
decisions in 1994. The Committee raised rates at individual meetings by larger amounts in the e arly 1980s, 
when it raised the federal funds rate to near 20 percent.   - 7 - 
And in keeping with this logic and based on the data in hand at this moment, there 
appears to be little turb ulence ahead , so I currently favor a 25 -basis point increase at the 
FOMC’s next meeting at the end of this month.  Beyond that, we still have a considerable 
way to go toward our 2 percent inflation goal, and I expect to support continued tightening of mone tary policy. 
I think that is probably enough from me, so that there will be  more time for you to 
ask questions.  Thank you again to the CFR for the opportunity to be here today.

What the Federal Reserve Is Doing to Promote a Stronger Job Market 
 
 
Remarks by 
 
Janet L. Yellen 
 
Chair 
 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
 
at 
 
2014 National Interagency Community Reinvestment Conference 
 
Chicago, Illinois 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
March 31, 2014 
  
I am here today to talk about what the Federal Reserve is doing to help our nation 
recover from the financial crisis and the Great Recession, the effects of which were 
particularly severe for the people and the communities you serve.  
Part of that effort has involved strengthening the financial system.  New rules are 
in place to better protect consumers and ensure that credit is available to help 
communities grow.  The Federal Reserve also plays a role in communities by fostering 
dialogue that promotes community development.  I will highlight some initiatives around 
the Federal Reserve System that I believe are making a real difference.  Later today, I 
will visit the Manufacturing Technology Program at Daley College, on Chicago’s south 
side, where adult students are acquiring the skills they need to connect to good-paying 
jobs in that sector.  
The Fed supports the work you do in communities because you make a difference.  
You help ensure that credit is available for families to buy homes and for small 
businesses to expand.  Your organizations sponsor programs that help make communities 
safer and families healthier and more financially secure.  One of the most important 
things you do is to help people meet the demands of finding a job in what remains a 
challenging economy.  And that help is crucial, but I also believe it can’t succeed without 
two other things. 
The first of these is the courage and determination of the people you serve.  The 
past six years have been difficult for many Americans, but the hardships faced by some 
have shattered lives and families.  Too many people know firsthand how devastating it is 
to lose a job at which you had succeeded and  be unable to find another; to run through 
your savings and even lose your home, as months and sometimes years pass trying to find  - 2 - 
work; to feel your marriage and other relationships strained and broken by financial 
difficulties.  And yet many of those who have suffered the most find the will to keep 
trying.  I will introduce you to three of these brave men and women, your neighbors here 
in the great city of Chicago.  These individuals have benefited from just the kind of help 
from community groups that I highlighted a moment ago, and they recently shared their 
personal stories with me. 
It might seem obvious, but the second thing that is needed to help people find 
jobs…is jobs.  No amount of training will be enough if there are not enough jobs to fill.  I 
have mentioned some of the things the Fed does to help communities, but the most 
important thing we do is to use monetary policy to promote a stronger economy.  The 
Federal Reserve has taken extraordinary steps since the onset of the financial crisis to 
spur economic activity and create jobs, and I will explain why I believe those efforts are 
still needed.   
The Fed provides this help by influencing interest rates.  Although we work 
through financial markets, our goal is to help Main Street, not Wall Street.  By keeping 
interest rates low, we are trying to make homes more affordable and revive the housing 
market.  We are trying to make it cheaper for businesses to build,  expand, and hire.  We 
are trying to lower the costs of buying a car that can carry a worker to a new job and kids 
to school, and our policies are also spurring the revival of the auto industry.  We are 
trying to help families afford things they need so that greater spending can drive job 
creation and even more spending, thereby strengthening the recovery.    - 3 - 
When the Federal Reserve’s policies are effective, they improve the welfare of 
everyone who benefits from a stronger economy, most of all those who have been hit 
hardest by the recession and the slow recovery.   
Now let me offer my view of the state of the recovery, with particular attention to 
the labor market and conditions faced by workers.  Nationwide, and in Chicago, the 
economy and the labor market have strengthened considerably from the depths of the 
Great Recession.  Since the unemployment rate peaked at 10 percent in October 2009, the 
economy has added more than 7-1/2 million jobs and the unemployment rate has fallen 
more than 3  percentage points to 6.7 percent.  That progress has been gradual but 
remarkably steady --February was the 41 st consecutive month of payroll growth, one of 
the longest stretch es ever.   
Chicago, as you all know, was hit harder than many areas during the recession 
and remains a tougher market for workers.  But there has been considerable improvement 
here also.  Unemployment in the city of Chicago is down from a peak of nearly 13 
percent to about 9-1/2 percent at last count.  That is about the same improvement as in the 
larger Chicago metro area, where unemployment has fallen to 8-1/2 percent.  Metro 
Chicago has added 183,000 jobs since 2009, just below the rate for job gains nationwide.1 
But while there has been steady progress, there is also no doubt that the economy 
and the job market are not back to normal health.  That will not be news to many of you, 
or to the 348,000  people in and around Chicago who were counted as looking for work in 
                                                 
1 According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, total nonfarm employment for the Chicago-Joliet-Naperville 
metropolitan division has increased 183,000 since December 2009, or about 5 percent.  Over this period, 
employment nationally has increased about 6 percent.      - 4 - 
January.2  It will not be news to consumers or to owners of small and medium-sized 
businesses, who surveys say remain cautious about the strength and durability of the 
recovery.  
The recovery still feels like a recession to many Americans, and it also looks that 
way in some economic statistics.  At 6.7 percent, the national unemployment rate is still 
higher than it ever got during the 2001 recession.  That is also the case in Chicago and in 
many other cities.  It certainly feels like a recession to many younger workers, to older 
workers who lost long-term jobs,  and to African  Americans, who are facing a job market 
today that is nearly as tough as it was during the two downturns that preceded the Great 
Recession.   
In some ways, the job market is tougher now than in any recession.  The numbers 
of people who have been trying to find work for more than six months or more than a 
year are much higher today than they ever were since records began decades ago.  We 
know that the long-term unemployed face big challenges.  Research shows employers are 
less willing to hire the long-term unemployed and often prefer other job candidates with 
less or even no relevant experience.3 
That is what Dorine Poole learned, after she lost her job processing medical 
insurance claims, just as the recession was getting started.  Like many others, she could 
not find any job, despite clerical skills and experience acquired over 15 years of steady 
employment.  When employers started hiring again, two years of unemployment became

workers without a long spell of unemployment.  That career, that part of Dorine’s life, 
had ended.   
For Dorine and others, we know that workers displaced by layoffs and plant 
closures who manage to find work suffer long-lasting and often permanent wage 
reductions.4  Jermaine Brownlee was an apprentice plumber and skilled construction 
worker when the recession hit, and he saw his wages drop sharply as he scrambled for 
odd jobs and temporary work.  He is doing better now, but still working for a lower wage 
than he earned before the recession.  
Vicki Lira lost her full-time job of 20 years when the printing plant she worked in 
shut down in 2006.  Then she lost a job processing mortgage applications when the 
housing market crashed.  Vicki faced some very difficult years.  At times she was 
homeless.  Today she enjoys her part-time job serving food samples to customers at a 
grocery store but wishes she could get more hours.   
Vicki Lira is one of many Americans who lost a full-time job in the recession and 
seem stuck working part time.  The unemployment rate is down, but not included in that 
rate are more than seven million people who are working part time but want a full-time 
job.  As a share of the workforce, that number is very high historically.

I have described the experiences of Dorine, Jermaine,  and Vicki because they tell 
us important things that the unemployment rate alone cannot.  First, they are a reminder 
that there are real people behind the statistics, struggling to get by and eager for the 
opportunity to build better lives.  Second, their experiences show some of the uniquely 
challenging and lasting effects of the Great Recession.  Recognizing and trying to 
understand these effects helps provide a clearer picture of the progress we have made in 
the recovery,  as well as a view of just how far we still have to go.   
And based on the evidence available, it is clear to me that the U.S. economy is 
still considerably short of the two goals assigned to the Federal Reserve by the Congress.  
The first of tho se goals is maximum sustainable employment, the highest level of 
employment that can be sustained while maintaining a stable inflation rate.  Most of m y 
colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee and I estimate that the unemployment 
rate consistent with maximum sustainable employment is now between 5.2 percent and 
5.6 percent, well below the 6.7 percent rate in February.   
The other goal assigned by the Congress is stable prices, which means keeping 
inflation under control.  In the past, there have been times when these two goals 
conflicted --fighting inflation often requires actions that slow the economy and raise the 
unemployment rate.  But that is not a dilemma now, because inflation is well below 
2 percent, the Fed’s longer-term goal.  
The Federal Reserve takes its inflation goal very seriously.  One reason why I 
believe it is appropriate for the Federal Reserve to continue to provide substantial help to 
the labor market, without adding to the risks of inflation, is because of the evidence I see  - 7 - 
that there remains considerable slack in the economy and the labor market.  Let me 
explain what I mean by that word “slack” and why it is so important. 
Slack means that there are significantly more people willing and capable of filling 
a job than there are jobs for them to fill.  During a period of little or no slack, there still 
may be vacant jobs and people who want to work, but a large share of those willing to 
work lack the skills or are otherwise not well suited for the jobs that are available.  With 
6.7 percent unemployment, it might seem that there must be a lot of slack in the U. S. 
economy, but there are reasons why that may not be true.   
One important reason relates to the skills and education of people in the 
workforce.  It is no secret that America faces some daunting challenges in educating 
people and preparing them to work in a 21 st century, globalized economy.  Many of you 
in this audience are helping workers address this challenge, but you also know that the 
economy continues to change very rapidly.   
To the extent that people who desire to work lack the skills that employers are 
demanding, there is less slack in the labor market.  This is an example of what 
economists call “structural” unemployment, and it can be difficult to solve.  Even 
understanding what workers need to appeal to employers is difficult in a fast-changing 
economy.  For government, effective solutions for structural unemployment, beginning 
with improved education, tend to be expensive and take a long time to work.  The 
problem goes deeper than simply a lack of jobs.   
But a lack of jobs is the heart of the problem when unemployment is caused by 
slack, which we also call “cyclical unemployment.”  The governm ent has the tools to 
address cyclical unemployment.  Monetary policy is one such tool, and the Federal  - 8 - 
Reserve has been active ly using it to strengthen the recovery and create jobs, which 
brings me to why the amount of slack is so important.   
If unemployment were mostly structural, if workers were unable to perform the 
jobs available, then the Federal Reserve’s efforts to create jobs would not be very 
effective.  Worse than that, without slack in the labor market, the economic stimulus from 
the Fed could put attaining our inflation goal at risk.  In fact, judging how much slack 
there is in the labor market is one of the most important questions that my Federal 
Reserve colleagues and I consider when making monetary policy decisions, because our 
inflation goal is no less important than the goal of maximum employment.  
This is not just an academic debate.  For Dorine Poole, Jermaine Brownlee, and 
Vicki Lira, and for millions of others dislocated by the Great Recession who continue to 
struggle, the cause of the slow recovery is enormously important.  As I said earlier, the 
powerful force that sustains them and others who keep trying to succeed in this recovery 
is the faith that their job prospects will improve and that their efforts will be rewarded.   
Now let me explain why I believe there is still considerable slack in the labor 
market, why I think there is room for continued help from the Fed for workers, and why I 
believe Dorine Poole, Jermaine Brownlee,  and Vicki Lira are right to hope for better days 
ahead. 
One form of evidence for slack is found in other labor market data, beyond the 
unemployment rate or payrolls, some of which I have touched on already.  For example, 
the seven million people who are working part time but would like a full-time job.  This 
number is much larger than we would expect at 6.7 percent unemployment, based on past 
experience, and the existence of such a large pool of “partly unemployed” workers is a  - 9 - 
sign that labor conditions are worse than indicated by the unemployment rate.  Statistics 
on job turnover also point to considerable slack in the labor market.  Although firms are 
now laying off fewer workers, they have been reluctant to increase the pace of hiring.  
Likewise, the number of people who voluntarily quit their jobs is noticeably below levels 
before the recession; that is an indicator that people are reluctant to risk leaving their jobs 
because they worry that it will be hard to find another.  It is also a sign that firms may not 
be recruiting very aggressively to hire workers away from their competitors. 
A second form of evidence for slack is that the decline in unemployment has not 
helped raise wages for workers as in past recoveries.  Workers in a slack market have 
little leverage to demand raises.  Labor compensation has increased an average of only a 
little more than 2 percent per year since the recession, which is very low by historical 
standards.5  Wage growth for most workers was modest for a couple of decades before 
the recession due to globalization and other factors beyond the level of economic activity, 
and those forces are undoubtedly still relevant.  But labor market slack has also surely 
been a factor in holding down compensation.  The low rate of wage growth is, to me, 
another sign that the Fed’s job is not yet don e. 
A third form of evidence related to slack concerns the characteristics of the 
extraordinarily large share of the unemployed who have been out of work for six months 
or more.  These workers find it exceptionally hard to find steady, regular work,  and they 
appear to be at a severe competitive disadvantage when trying to find a job.  The concern 
is that the long-term unemployed may remain on the sidelines, ultimately dropping out of 
                                                 
5 From 2010 to 2013, average annual growth in compensation per hour, hourly compensation as measured 
in the Employment Cost Index and average hourly earnings for all employees in private industries --all 
independent estimates of wage and compensation growth --increased annually, on average, no more than 2-
1/4 percent .   - 10 - 
the workforce.  But the data suggest that the long-term unemployed look basically the 
same as other unemployed people in terms of their occupations, educational attainment,  
and other characteristics.  And, although they find jobs with lower frequency than the 
short-term jobless do, the rate at which job seekers are finding jobs has only marginally 
improved for both groups.  That is, we have not yet seen clear indications that the short-
term unemployed are finding it increasingly easier to find work relative to the long-term 
unemployed.  This fact gives me hope that a significant share of the long-term 
unemployed will ultimately benefit from a stronger labor market.  
A final piece of evidence of slack in the labor market has been the behavior of the 
participation rate --the proportion of working-age adults that hold or are seeking jobs.  
Participation falls in a slack job market when people who want a job give up trying to 
find one.  When the recession began, 66 percent of the working-age population was part 
of the labor force.  Participation dropped,  as it normally does in a recession , but then kept 
dropping in the recovery.  It now stands at 63 percent, the same level as in 1978, when a 
much smaller share of women were in the workforce.  Lower participation could mean 
that the 6.7 percent unemployment rate is overstating the progress in the labor market. 
One factor lowering participation is the aging of the population, which means that 
an increasing share of the population is retired.  If demographics were the only or 
overwhelming reason for falling participation, then declining participation would not be a 
sign of labor market slack.  But some “retirements” are not voluntary,  and some of these 
workers may rejoin the labor force in a stronger economy.  Participation rates have been 
falling broadly for workers of different ages, including many in the prime of their 
working lives.  Based on the evidence, my own view is that a significant amount of the  - 11 - 
decline in participation during the recovery is due to slack, another sign that help from 
the Fed can still be effective.  
Since late 2008, the Fed has taken extraordinary steps to revive the economy.  At 
the height of the crisis, we provided liquidity to help avert a collapse of the financial 
system, which enabled banks and other institutions to continue to provide credit to people 
and businesses depending on it.  We cut short-term interest rates as low as they can go 
and indicated that we would keep them low for as long as necessary to support a stronger 
economic recovery.  And we have been purchasing large quantities of longer-term 
securities in order to put additional downward pressure on longer-term interest rates--the 
rates that matter to people shopping for a new car, looking to buy or renovate a home, or 
expand a business.  There is little doubt that without these actions, the recession and slow 
recovery would have been far worse. 
These different measures have the same goal --to encourage consumers to spend 
and businesses to invest, to promote a recovery in the housing market, and to put more 
people to work.  Together they represent an unprecedentedly large and sustained 
commitment by the Fed to do what is necessary to help our nation recover from the Great 
Recession.  For the many reasons I have noted today, I think this extraordinary 
commitment is still needed and will be for some time, and I believe that view is widely 
shared by my fellow policymakers at the Fed.   
In this context, recent steps by the Fed to reduce the rate of new securities 
purchases are not a lessening of this commitment, only a judgment that recent progress in 
the labor market means our aid for the recovery need not grow as quickly.  Earlier this  - 12 - 
month, the Fed reiterated its overall commitment to maintain extraordinary support for 
the recovery for some time to come. 
This commitment is strong, and I believe the Fed’s policies will continue to help 
sustain progress in the job market.  But the scars from the Great Recession remain, and 
reaching our goals will take time.  In the meanwhile, the Federal Reserve will continue to 
expand its efforts to promote community development .  The Board and each of the 
12 Reserve Banks have community development staff members who focus on improving 
the availability of financial services in low- and moderate-income communities.  They 
help bankers comply with the Community Reinvestment Act,  but they are also a source 
of research and a facilitator of communication among financial institutions and 
practitioners to identify and share best practices.   
This conference is one example of how the Fed pursues those goals, and I woul d 
like to mention a few of the Fed’s other community development initiatives that I find 
particularly promising.  In 2012, The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco partnered 
with the Low Income Investment Fund (LIIF), a community development financial 
institution that bridges the gap between low-income neighborhoods and private capital 
sources, to publish the book Investing in What Works for America’s Communities .  This 
book cited innovative and effective community development initiatives across the 
country and advocated for a “Community Quarterback” model to coordinate initiatives 
and better leverage funding among groups with similar goals.   
In a similar way, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston has been the catalyst for the 
Working Cities Challenge, inspired by its own research on cities that managed to 
diversify away from a declining, manufacturing-based economy.  The research found that  - 13 - 
one key to success is “collaborative leadership,” when governments, businesses, and 
nonprofits unite behind one focused approach.  The Working Cities Challenge promotes 
that principle by inviting smaller Massachusetts cities to consider how they would use 
collaborative leadership to unite their communities to address a major challenge for 
lower-income residents.  Twenty cities competed for $1.8 million in funding from the 
state and other sources.  Six cities were awarded funds this past January,  but many more 
will benefit from the spread of a new approach to capacity building that Fed research 
shows helps communities thrive.   
Leadership recruitment is also at the heart of a grassroots-oriented program called 
Economic Avenue that was developed by the Kansas City Fed.  In Northeast Kansas City, 
Kansas, residents and neighborhood leaders are forming a leadership council that will 
have responsibility for managing the program, which aims to create and grow local 
businesses, create jobs,  and promote homeownership.  The bank’s community 
development staff is providing education and training to get the council off the ground, 
will measure and evaluate its progress, and assist in connecting leaders to resources and 
other programs.  
These examples are just a few among many throughout the Federal Reserve 
System.  By testing ideas, developing better measurement tools, convening interested 
parties, and sharing the Federal Reserve’s skills and knowledge with our partners at the 
national and local levels, we aim to serve as a catalyst to improve lives.   
Through these initiatives, together with the use of monetary policy and steps to 
safeguard the financial system, the Federal Reserve is committed to strengthening 
communities and restoring a healthy economy that benefits all Americans.  It is my hope  - 14 - 
that the courageous and determined working people I have told you about today, and 
millions more, will get the chance they deserve to build better lives.

I would like to thank the conference organizers for  the opportunity to offer a few 
remarks on the causes of the 200 7-09 financial crisis as well as on the Federal Reserve’s 
policy response.  The topic is a large one, and today I will be able only to lay out  some 
basic themes.  In doing so , I will draw from  talks and testimonies that I gave during the 
crisis and its aftermath , particularly  my testimony to the Financial Crisis Inquiry 
Commission in September 2010.1  Given the time available , I will focus  narrowly  on the 
financial crisis and  the Federal Reserve’s response  in its capacity as liquidity provider of 
last resort , leaving  discussions of monetary policy and the aftermath of the crisis to 
another occasion . 
Triggers and V ulnerabilities  
 In its analysis of the crisis,  my testimony befo re the Financial Crisis Inquiry 
Commission drew the distinction between triggers and vulnerabilities.  The triggers  of 
the crisis were the particular events or factors that touched off the events of 2007 -09--the 
proximate causes, if you will.  Developments  in the market for subprime mortgages were 
a prominent example of a trigger of the crisis.  In contrast, the vulnerabilities  were the 
structural, and more fundamental, weaknesses in the financial system and in regulation 
and supervision that served to propagate and amplif y the initial shocks.   In the private 
sector, some key vulnerabilities included high levels of leverage ; excessive dependence 
on unstable short -term funding ; deficiencies in risk management in major financial firms ; 
and the use of exotic an d nontransparent financial instruments that obscured 
concentrations of risk.  In the public sector, my list of vulnerabilities would include gaps 
in the regulatory structure that allowed systemically important firms and markets to

escape comprehensive supe rvision ; failures of supervisors to effectively apply some 
existing authorities ; and insufficient attention to threats to the stability of the system as a 
whole (that is, the lack of a macroprudential focus in regulation and supervision).  
 The distinction between triggers and vulnerabilities is helpful in that it allows us 
to better understand why the factors that are often cited as touching off the crisis seem 
disproportionate to the magnitude of the financial and economic reaction.  Consider 
subprime mort gages, on which many popular accounts of the crisis focus.  
Contemporaneous data indicated that the total quantity of subprime mortgages 
outstanding in 2007 was well less than $1 trillion ; some more -recent accounts place the 
figure somewhat higher.  In abs olute terms, of course, the potential for losses on these 
loans was large --on the order of hundreds of billions of dollars.   However, judged in 
relation to the size of global financial markets, aggregate exposures  to subprime 
mortgages were  quite modest.  By way of comparison, it is not especially uncommon for 
one day’s paper losses  in global stock markets to exceed the losses on subprime 
mortgages  suffered during the entire crisis, without obvious ill effect on market 
functioning or on the economy.  Thus, losses on subprime mortgages can plausibly 
account for the massive reaction seen during the crisis only insofar as they interacted with 
other factors --more fundamental vulnerabilities --that served to amplify their effects.     
 On the surface, the puzzle of  disproportionate cause and effect seems somewhat 
less stark if one takes the boom and bust in the U.S. housing market as the  trigger  of the 
crisis, as the paper gains and losses associated with the swing in house prices  were many 
times the losses associat ed directly with subprime loans.   Indeed, t he 30  percent  or so 
aggregate decline in house prices  since their peak has by now eliminated nearly  $7  - 3 - 
trillion in paper wealth .  However, on closer examination, it is not clear that even the 
large movements in house prices, in the absence of the underlying weaknesse s in our 
financial system, can  account for the magnitude of the crisis.  First, much of the decline 
in house prices has occurred since the most intense phase of the crisis; the decline in 
prices since  September 2008 is probably better viewed as largely the result of , rather than 
a cause of, the crisis and ensuing recession.  More fundamentally, however, any theory of 
the crisis that ties its magnitude to the size of the housing bust must also explain w hy the 
fall of dot -com stock prices just a few years earlier, which destroyed  as much or more  
paper wealth --more than $8 trillion --resulted in  a relatively short and mild recession  and 
no major financial instability .2  Once again, the explanation of the di fferences between 
the two episodes must be that the problems in housing and mortgage markets interacted 
with deeper vulnerabilities in the financial system in ways that the dot -com bust did not.    
So let me turn, then, to a discussion of those vulnerabilit ies and how they  amplified  the 
effects of triggers  like the collapse of the subprime  mortgage market.    
A number of the vulnerabilities I listed a few moments ago were associated with 
the increased importance of the so -called shadow banking system.  Shadow  bank ing, as 
usually defined, comprises a diverse set of institutions  and markets  that, collectively, 
carry out traditional banking functions --but do so outside, or in ways only loosely linked 
to, the traditional system of  regulated depository institutions .  Examples of important 
                                                 
2 According to the Fede ral Reserve’s statistical release “Flow of Funds Accounts of the United States,” t he 
value of real estate held by households fell from $22.7 trillion in the first quarter of 2006 to $20.9 trillion in 
the fourth quarter of 2007 (down 8.1 percent from the fi rst quarter of 2006).  It then declined to 
$18.5  trillion in the third quarter of 2008 (down 18.6 percent from the first quarter of 2006) and to 
$16.0  trillion in the fourth quarter of 2011 (down 29.7 percent f rom the first quarter of 2006).  The stock 
market wealth of U.S. households peaked at $18.1 trillion in the first quarter of 2000 and fell $6.2 trillion to 
$11.9 trillion through the third quarter of 2001.  After a short -lived recovery, stock market wealth bottomed 
at $9.9 trillion in the third quarte r of 2002.  Overall, stock market wealth fell $8.3 trillion (or 46 percent) 
between its peak in the first quarter of 2000 and its trough in the third quarter of 2002.   The flow of funds 
accounts are published quarterly and are available at www.federalreser ve.gov/releases/z1 .   - 4 - 
components of the shadow banking system include securitization vehicles, asset -backed 
commercial paper (ABCP)  conduits , money market mutual funds,  markets for repurchase 
agreements (repos),  investment banks, and mortgage companies.   Before the crisis, the 
shadow banking system had come to play a major role in global finance . 
Economically speaking , as I noted, shadow bank ing bears strong functional 
similarities to the traditional banking sector.  Like traditional banking,  the shadow 
banking sector facilitates  maturity transformation ( that is, it is used to fund longer -term, 
less-liquid assets with short -term, more -liquid liabilities) , and it channel s savings into 
specific investments, mostly debt-like instruments.   In part, the rapid growth of shadow 
banking reflected various types of regulatory arbitrage --for example, the minimization of 
capital requirements .  However, instruments that fund the shadow bank ing system, such 
as money market mutual funds and repos, als o met a rapidly growing demand among 
investors , generally large  institution s and corporations, seeking cash -like assets for use in  
manag ing their liquidity.  Commercial banks were limited  in their ability to meet this 
growing demand  by prohibitions on the payment of interest on business checking 
accounts and by relatively low limits on the size of deposit accounts that can be insured 
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ). 
As became apparent during the crisis, a key vulnerability of the system was the 
heavy  reliance of the shadow banking sector , as well as some of the largest global banks,  
on various forms of short -term wholesale funding, including commercial paper, rep os, 
securities lending transactions, and  interbank loans .  The ease, flexibil ity, and low 
perceived cost of short -term funding also supported a broader trend toward higher  - 5 - 
leverage and greater maturity mismatch in individual shadow banking institutions and in 
the sector as a whole.  
While banks also rely on short -term funding and le verage, they benefit from a 
government -provided safety net, including deposit insurance  and backstop liquidity 
provision  by the central bank .  Shadow bank ing activities do not have these safeguards , 
so they employ  alternative  mechanisms to gain investor co nfidence .  Among these 
mechanisms are the collateralization of many shadow banking liabilities ; regulatory or 
contractual restrictions placed on portfolio holdings, such as the liquidity and credit 
quality requirements applicable to money market mutual fun ds; and the imprimaturs of 
credit rating agencies.   Indeed, the very foundation of shadow banking and its rapid 
growth before the crisis was the widely held view (among both investors and regulators)  
that these safeguards would protect shadow bank ing activ ities against runs and panics , 
similar to the protection given to commercial banking by the government safety net .  
Unfortunately, this view turned out to be wrong.  When it became clear to investors that 
these alternative protections might not be adequate to protect against losses, widespread  
flight from the shadow banking system occurred, with pernicious dynamics reminiscent 
of the banking panics of an earlier era .  
 Although the vulnerabilities associated with short -term wholesale funding and 
excessive leverage can be seen as structural weakness es of the global financial system, 
they can also be viewed as a consequence of poor risk management by financial 
institutions  and investors, which I would count as a nother  major  vulnerability of the 
system  before the crisis .  Unfortunately, the crisis revealed a number of significant 
defects in private -sector risk management and risk controls , importantly including   - 6 - 
insufficient capacity by many large firms to track firmwide risk exposures, such as  off-
balance -sheet exposures.   
This lack of capacity by major financial institutions  to track firmwide risk 
exposures led in turn  to inadequate risk diversification , so that losses --rather than being 
dispersed broadly --proved in some cases to be heavily concentrated  among relatively 
few, highly leveraged  companies .  Here, I think, is the principal explanation of why the 
busts in dot -com stock prices an d in the housing and mortgage markets had such 
markedly different effects.  In the case of dot -com stocks, losses were spread relatively 
widely acr oss many types of investo rs.  In contrast, f ollowing  the housing  and mortgage  
bust, losses were felt dispropo rtionately at key nodes of the financial system , notably 
highly leveraged banks , broker -dealers , and securitization vehicles .  Some of these 
entities  were forced to engage in  rapid asset sales at fire -sale prices, which undermined 
confidence in counterpart ies exposed to these assets , led to sharp withdrawals of funding, 
and disrupted financial intermediation, with severe consequences for the economy . 
Private -sector risk management also failed  to keep up with financial innovation in 
many cases.  An important example is the extension of the traditional originate -to-
distribute business model to encompass increasingly complex securitized credit products, 
with wholesale market funding playing a key  role.  In general, the originate -to-distribute 
model breaks down the process of credit extension into components or stages --from 
origination to financing and to the postfinancing monitoring of the borrower’s ability to 
repay --in a manner reminiscent of ho w manufacturers distribute the stages of production 
across firms and locations.  This general approach has been used in various forms for 
many years and can produce significant benefits, including lower credit costs and  - 7 - 
increased access of consumers and small and medium -sized b usinesses  to capital markets.  
However, the expanded use of this model to finance subprime mortgages through 
securitization was mismanaged at several points, including the initial underwriting, which 
deteriorated markedly , in part bec ause of incentive schemes that effectively rewarded 
originators for the quantity rather than the quality of the mortgages extended.  Loans 
were then packaged into securities that proved complex , opaque,  and unwieldy; for 
example, when defaults became wides pread, the legal agreements underlying the 
securitizations made reasonable modifications of troubled mortgages difficult.  Rating 
agencies’ ratings of asset -backed securities were revealed to be subject to conflicts of 
interest and faulty models.  At the e nd of the chain were investors who often relied 
mainly on ratings  and did not make distinctions among AAA -rated securities .  Even if the 
ultimate  investors wanted to do their own credit analysis, the information needed to do so 
was often difficult or impos sible to obtain.  
 Dependence on short -term funding , high leverage,  and inadequate risk 
management were critical vulnerabilities of the private sector  prior to the crisis.  
Derivative transactions further increased risk concentrations and the vulnerability of the 
system, notably by shifting the location and apparent nature of exposures in ways that 
were not transparent to many market participants.  But even as private -sector activities 
increased systemic risk, the  public sector also failed to appreciate or s ufficiently respond 
to the building vulnerabilities  in the financial system --both because the statutory 
framework of financial regulation was not well  suited to addressing some key 
vulnerabilities and because some of the authorities that did exist  were not  used 
effectively .  - 8 - 
In retrospect, it is clear that  the statutory framework of financial regulation in 
place before the crisis contained serious gaps.  Critically, shadow bank ing activitie s were, 
for the most part, not subject to consistent and effective re gulatory oversight.  Much 
shadow bank ing lacked meaningful prudential regulation, including various special 
purpose vehicles, ABCP conduits , and many nonbank mortgage -origination companies.  
No regulatory body restricted the leverage and liquidity policies  of these entiti es, and few 
if any regulatory standards were imposed on the quality of their risk management or the 
prudence of their risk -taking.  Market discipline, imposed by creditors and counterparties, 
helped on some dimensions but did not effectivel y limit the systemic  risks these entities 
posed . 
Other shadow bank ing activitie s were potentially subject to some prudential 
oversight, but weaknesses in the statutory and regulatory framework meant that in 
practice they were inadequately regulated and sup ervised.  For example, the Securities 
and Exchange Commission supervised  the largest broker -dealer holding companies but 
only through an opt -in arrangement that lacked the force of a statutory regulatory regime.  
Large broker -dealer holding companies faced  serious losses and funding problems during 
the crisis, and the instability of such firms as Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers severely 
damaged the financial system.  Similarly, the insurance operations of American 
International Group, Inc. (AIG), were supe rvised and regulated by various state and 
international insurance regulators, and the Office of Thrift Supervision had authority to 
supervise AIG as a thrift holding company.  However, oversight of AIG Financial 
Products, which housed the derivatives activ ities that imposed major losses on the firm, 
was extremely limited in practice.   - 9 - 
The gaps in  statutory authority  had the additional effect of limiting  the 
information available to regulators  and, consequently, may have made it more difficult to 
recognize t he underlying vulnerabilities and complex linkages in the overall financial 
system .  Shadow bank ing institutions  that were unregulated  or lightly regulated  were  
typically  not required to report data that would have adequately reveal ed their risk 
positions or practices.  Moreover, the lack of preexisting reporting and supervisory 
relationships hindered systematic gathering of information that might have helped 
policymakers in the early days of the crisis.  
A broader failing was that  regulatory agencies  and supervis ory practices were 
focused on the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions or markets --what 
we now refer to as microprudential supervision .  In the United States and most other 
advanced economies, no governmenta l entity had either a mandate or sufficient 
authority --now often called macroprudential authority --to take actions to limit systemic 
risks  that could result from the collective behavior of financial institutions and markets.   
Gaps in the statutory framewor k were an important reason for the buildup of risk  
in certain parts of the system and for the inadequate response of the public sector to that 
buildup.  But even when the relevant statutory authorities did exist, they were not always 
used forcefully or eff ectively enough by regulators and supervisors, including the Federal 
Reserve.  Notably,  bank regulators did not do enough to force large financial institutions 
to strengthen their internal risk -management systems or to curtail risky practices.  The 
Federal  Reserve’s Supervisory Capital Assessment Program , undertaken in the spring of 
2009  and popularly known as the “stress tests,” played a critical role in restoring 
confidence in the U.S. banking system , but it also demonstrated that many institutions’  - 10 - 
infor mation systems could not provide timely, accurate information about bank exposures 
to counterparties or complete information about the aggregate  risks posed by different 
positions and portfolios.  Regulators had recognized these problems in some cases but did 
not press firms vigorously enough to fix them.   
Even without a macroprudential mandate, r egulators could also have done more to 
try to mitigate  risks to the broader financial system.  In retrospect, stronger bank capital 
standards --notably those relati ng to the quality of capital and the amount of capital 
required for banks’ trading book assets --and more attention to the liquidity risks faced by 
the largest, most interconnected firms  would have made the financial system as a whole 
more resilient.  
The Cr isis as a Classic Financial Panic   
Having laid out some of the triggers and vulnerabilities that set the stage for the 
crisis, I can briefly sketch the evolution of the crisis itself.  As I have noted, 
developments in housing and mortgage markets played an  important role as triggers.  
Beginning in 2007, d eclining house prices and rising rates of foreclosure raised serious 
concerns about the values of mortgage -related assets and considerable uncertainty about 
where those losses would fall.  The economy offic ially fell into recession in 
December  2007, following several months of financial stress .  However, the most severe 
economic consequences followed the extreme market movements in the fall of 2008.  
To a significant extent, the crisis is best understood as a classic financial panic --
differing in details but fundamentally similar to the panics  described by  Bagehot and 
many others.3  The most familiar type of panic  that has occurred historically , involving  
                                                 
3 See Walter Bagehot ([1873] 1897), Lombard Street:  A Description of the Money Market (New York:  
Charles Scribner’s Sons) .  The classic theoretical analysis of “pure” banking panics is in Douglas W.  - 11 - 
runs on banks by retail depositors, ha d been made largely obsolete by deposit insurance , 
central bank backstop liquidity facilities,  and the associated government supervision of 
banks.  But a panic is possible in any situation in which longer -term, illiquid assets are 
financed by short -term, li quid liabilities and in which providers  of short -term funding 
either lose confidence in the borrower or become worried that other short -term lenders 
may lose confidence.  The combination of dependence on wholesale, short -term 
financing; excessive leverage;  generally poor risk management ; and the gaps and 
weaknesses in regulatory oversight created an environment in which a powerful, self -
reinforcing panic could begin.4 
Indeed, panic -like phenomena  arose in multiple contexts  and in multiple ways  
during the cr isis.  The repo market, a major source of short -term credit for many financial 
institutions, notably including the independent investment banks, was an important 
example.  In repo agreements,  loans are collateralized by financial assets,  and the 
maximum am ount of the loan is the current assessed value of the collateral less a safety 
margin, or haircut.  The secured nature of repo agreements gave firms and regulators 
confidence that runs were unlikely .  But this confidence was misplaced.  Once the crisis 
began, repo lenders became increasingly concerned about the possibility that they would 
be forced to receive collateral instead of cash, collateral that would then have to be 
disposed of in falling and illiquid markets.  In some contexts, lenders responded by  
                                                                                                                                                 
Diamond and Philip H. Dybvig (1983 ), “Bank Runs, Deposit Insurance, and Liquidity,” Journal of 
Political Economy , vol. 91 ( 3), pp. 401 -19).  Note that the term “panic” does not necessarily imply 
irrational behavior on the part of depositors or investors; it is perfectly rational to partici pate in a run if one 
fears that the bank will be forced to close.  However, the collective action of many depositors or investors 
can lead to outcomes that are undesirable from the point of view of the economy as a whole.

imposing increasingly higher haircuts, cutting the effective amount of funding available 
to borrowers.  In other contexts, lenders simply pulled away, as in a deposit run; in these 
cases, some borrowers lost access to repo entirely, and some securities be came 
unfundable in the repo market.  In either case, absent sufficient funding, borrowers were 
frequently left with no  option but to sell assets into illiquid markets.  These forced sales 
drove down asset prices, increase d volatility, and weaken ed the fina ncial positions of all 
holders of similar assets.  Volatile asset prices and weaker borrower balance sheets in 
turn heightened  the risks borne by repo lenders , further boost ing the incentives to demand 
higher  haircuts or withdraw funding entirely.  This un stable dynamic was operating in 
full force around the time of the near  failure of Bear Stearns in March 2008 , and again  
during the worsening of the crisis in mid -September  of that year .5 
Classic panic -type phenomena  occurred in other contexts as well.  Early in the 
crisis, s tructured investment vehicles and many other asset -backed programs were unable 
to roll  over their  commercial paper as investors pulled back, and the programs were 
forced to draw on liquidity lines from banks or to sell assets.6  The resu lting pressure on 
the bank liquidity providers, evident especially in the market for dollar -denominated 
loans in short -term funding markets, impeded the functioning of the financial system 
throughout the crisis.  Following the Lehman collapse  and the “brea king of the buck” by

a money market mutual fund that held commercial paper issued by Lehman , both money 
market mutual funds and the commercial paper market  were also subject to runs .7  More 
generally, during the crisis , runs of short -term uninsured creditors created severe funding 
problems for a number of  financial firms , including several  large broker -dealers and also 
some bank holding companies .  In some cases, withdrawals of funds  by creditors were 
augmented by “runs”  in other guises --for example, by prime brokerage customers of 
investment banks concerned about the safety of cash and securities held at those firms or 
by derivatives counterparties demanding additional margin .8  Overall, the emergence of 
run-like phenomena in a variety of contexts  helps  explain the remarkably sharp and 
sudden intensification of the financial crisis, its rapid global spread, and the fact that 
standard market indicators  largely failed to forecast the abrupt deterioration in financial 
conditions .  
The multiple instances of run -like behavior during the crisis, together with the 
associated sharp increases in liquidity premiums and dysfunction in many markets , 
motivated much of the Federal Reserve’s policy response.9  Bagehot advised  central 
banks --the on ly institutions that have the power to increase the aggregate liquidity in the 
system --to respond to panics by lending freely against sound collateral.  Following that 
advice, from the beginning of the crisis , the Fed , like other major central banks , provi ded

large amounts of short -term liquidity to financial institutions, including primary dealers 
as well as banks, on a broad range of collateral.10  Reflecting the contemporary 
institutional environment, i t also provided backstop liquidity support for compon ents of 
the shadow banking system, including money market mutual funds, the commercial paper 
market, and the asset -backed securities markets.  To be sure, the provision of liquidity 
alone can by no means solve the problems of credit risk and credit losses , but it can 
reduce liquidity premiums, help restore the confidence of investors, and thus promote 
stability.   It can also reduce panic -driven credit problems in cases in which such problems 
result from price declines during liquidity -driven fire sales of a ssets.  
The pricing of the liquidity facilities was an important  part of the Federal 
Reserve’s strategy .  Rates could not be too high; to have a positive effect, and to 
minimize the stigma of borrowing, the facilities had to be attractive relative to rates 
available  (or nominally available)  in illiquid, dysfunctional markets.  At the same time, 
pricing had to be sufficiently unattractive that borrowers would voluntarily withdraw 
from these facilities as market conditions normalized.  This desired outcome in fact 
occurred :  By early 2010, emergency lending had been drastically reduced, along with the 
demand for such lending.  
The Federal Reserve’s  response s to the failure or near  failure of a number of 
systemically critical firms reflected the best of bad optio ns, given the absence of a legal 
framework for winding down such firms in an orderly way in the midst of a crisis --a 
framework that we now have .  However, those actions were, again, consistent  with the 
Bagehot approach  of lending against collateral to illiquid but solvent firms.  T he

New York for its conduct of open market operations in the implementation of monetary policy .  - 15 - 
acquisition of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan  Chase was facilitated by a Federal Reserve loan 
against a designated set of assets, and the provision of liquidity to AIG was collateralized 
by the a ssets of the largest insurance company in the U nited States.   In both cases the 
Federal Reserve determined that the loans were adequately secured, and in both cases the 
Federal Reserve  has either been repaid with interest or holds assets whose assessed 
values comfortably cover remaining loans.   
To say that the crisis was purely a  liquidity -based panic  would be to overstate the 
case.  C ertainly, an important part of the resolution of the crisis involved assuring 
markets and counterparties of the solvency of key financ ial institutions, and that 
assurance was provided in significant part by  the injection of capital, including public 
capital , and the issuance of guarantees --measures not available to the Federal Reserve.  In 
these respects , the Treasury -managed T roubled Asset Relief Program and the FDIC’s 
Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program played critical  roles.  As I have noted, the 
Federal Reserve did help restore confidence in the solvency of the banking system by 
leading the stress tests of the 19 largest U .S. bank holding companies in the spring of 
2009.  T hese stress tests , which were both rigorous and transparent,  helped make it 
possible for the tested banks  to raise $120 billion in private capital in the ensuing months.  
The response to the panic also involved an extraordinary amount of international 
consultation and coordination.  Following a key meeting of the Group of Seven finance 
ministers and central bank governors in Washington on October 10, 2008, the  
governments of other industrial countries took strong measures to stabilize key financial 
institutions and markets .  Central banks collaborated closely throughout the crisis; in  
particular, the Federal Reserve undertook swap agreements with 14 other central banks to  - 16 - 
help ensure adequate dollar liquidit y in global markets  and thus keep credit flowing to 
U.S. households and businesses . 
Conclusion  
 The financial crisis of 2007 -09 was difficult to anticipate  for two reasons:  First, 
financial panics, being to a significant extent self -fulfilling crises of c onfidence, are 
inherently difficult to foresee.  Second, although the crisis bore some resemblance at a 
conceptual level to the panics known to Bagehot, it occurred in a rather different 
institutional context and was propagated and amplified by a number of  vulnerabilities that 
had developed outside the traditional banking sector.  Once identified, however, the panic 
could be addressed to a significant extent using  classic tools, including backstop liquidity 
provision by central banks, both here and abroad.  
 To avoid or at least mitigate future panics, the vulnerabilities that underlay the 
recent crisis must be fully addressed.  As you know, this process is well under way at 
both the national and international levels.  I will h ave to leave to another time  a 
discussion of the extensive changes in regulatory frameworks, as well as the changes in 
the Federal Reserve’s own organization and practices, that have been or are being put in 
place.  Instead, I will close by noting that the events of the past few years ha ve forcibly 
reminded us of the damage that severe financial crises can cause.  Going forward, for the 
Federal Reserve as well as other central banks, the promotion of financial stability must 
be on an equal footing with the management of monetary policy as  the most critical 
policy priorities.  ",2012-04-13,bernanke

at the 
 
Federal Reserve Bank of Kans as City Economic Symposium 
 
Jackson Hole, Wyoming 
       
August 26, 2011  
 Good morning.  As always, thanks are due to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas 
City for organizing this conference.  This year’s topic, long-term  economic growth, is 
indeed pertinent--as has so often been the cas e at this symposium in past years.  In 
particular, the financial crisis  and the subsequent slow r ecovery have caused some to 
question whether the United St ates, notwithstanding its long -term record of vigorous 
economic growth, might not now be facing a prolonged period of stagnation, regardless 
of its public policy choices.  Might not the very slow pace of economic expansion of the 
past few years, not only in the United States but also in a number of other advanced 
economies, morph into something far more long-lasting? 
I can certainly appreciate these concerns and am fully aware of the challenges that 
we face in restoring economic and financia l conditions conducive to healthy growth, 
some of which I will comment on today.  With  respect to longer-run prospects, however, 
my own view is more optimistic.  As I will discuss, although important problems 
certainly exist, the growth fundamentals of th e United States do not appear to have been 
permanently altered by the shocks of the past f our years.  It may take some time, but we 
can reasonably expect to see a return to gr owth rates and employmen t levels consistent 
with those underlying fundamentals.  In the interim, however, the challenges for U.S. 
economic policymakers are twofold:  first, to  help our economy further recover from the 
crisis and the ensuing recession, and second, to do so in a way that will allow the 
economy to realize its longe r-term growth potential.  Economic policies should be 
evaluated in light of both of those objectives. 
 This morning I will offer some thoughts on why the pace of recovery in the United States has, for the most part, proved di sappointing thus far, and I will discuss the - 2 - 
 
 
 Federal Reserve’s policy response.  I will then turn briefly to the longer-term prospects of 
our economy and the need for our country’s eco nomic policies to be effective from both a 
shorter-term and longer-term perspective. 
Near-Term Prospects for the Economy and Policy 
In discussing the prospects for the ec onomy and for policy in the near term, it 
bears recalling briefly how we got here.  The financial crisis that gripped global markets 
in 2008 and 2009 was more severe than a ny since the Great Depression.  Economic 
policymakers around the world saw the mounting risks of a global financial meltdown in the fall of 2008 and understood the extraordinar ily dire economic consequences that such 
an event could have.  As I have described in  previous remarks at this forum, governments 
and central banks worked forcefully and in  close coordination to avert the looming 
collapse.  The actions to stabilize the fi nancial system were accompanied, both in the 
United States and abroad, by substantial monetary and fiscal stimulus.  But 
notwithstanding these strong and concerted efforts, severe damage to the global economy 
could not be avoided.  The freezing of credit, the sharp drops in asset prices, dysfunction 
in financial markets, and th e resulting blows to  confidence sent gl obal production and 
trade into free fall in late 2008 and early 2009. 
We meet here today almost exactly thr ee years since the beginning of the most 
intense phase of the financial crisis and a bit more than two years since the National 
Bureau of Economic Research’s date for th e start of the economic recovery.  Where do 
we stand? 
There have been some positive developments over the past few years, particularly 
when considered in the light of economic prosp ects as viewed at the depth of the crisis.  - 3 - 
 
 
 Overall, the global economy has seen signi ficant growth, led by the emerging-market 
economies.  In the United States, a cyclical  recovery, though a modest one by historical 
standards, is in its ninth qua rter.  In the financial sphere , the U.S. banking system is 
generally much healthier now, with banks hol ding substantially more capital.  Credit 
availability from banks has improved, though it remains tight in categories--such as small 
business lending--in which the balance sheets of potential borrowers remain impaired.  
Companies with access to the public bond market s have had no difficulty obtaining credit 
on favorable terms.  Importantly, structural reform is moving forward in the financial 
sector, with ambitious domestic and internat ional efforts underway to enhance the capital 
and liquidity of banks, especia lly the most systemically impor tant banks; to improve risk 
management and transparency; to strengthen market infrastructure; and to introduce a 
more systemic, or macroprudential, approach  to financial regula tion and supervision. 
In the broader economy, manufacturing produc tion in the United States has risen 
nearly 15 percent since its trough, driven substa ntially by growth in exports.  Indeed, the 
U.S. trade deficit has been notably lower recen tly than it was before the crisis, reflecting 
in part the improved competitiveness of U.S. goods and services.  Business investment in equipment and software has continued to expand, and productivity gains in some 
industries have been impressive, though ne w data have reduced estimates of overall 
productivity improvement in recent years.  H ouseholds also have made some progress in 
repairing their balance sheets- -saving more, borrowing less, a nd reducing their burdens of 
interest payments and debt.  Commodity pri ces have come off thei r highs, which will 
reduce the cost pressures facing businesse s and help increase household purchasing 
power.     - 4 - 
 
 
 Notwithstanding these more positive developments, howev er, it is clear that the 
recovery from the crisis has been much less robust than we had hoped.  From the latest 
comprehensive revisions to the national accounts  as well as the most recent estimates of 
growth in the first half of this year, we ha ve learned that the recession was even deeper 
and the recovery even weaker than we ha d thought; indeed, aggr egate output in the 
United States still has not returned to the le vel that it attained before the crisis.  
Importantly, economic growth has for the most part been at rates insufficient to achieve 
sustained reductions in unemployment, which ha s recently been fluctuating a bit above 9 
percent.  Temporary factors, including the effects of the run-up in commodity prices on 
consumer and business budgets and the effect of the Japanese disaster on global supply 
chains and production, were part of the reas on for the weak performance of the economy 
in the first half of 2011; accordingly, growth in  the second half looks likely to improve as 
their influence recedes.  However, the incomi ng data suggest that other, more persistent 
factors also have been at work. 
Why has the recovery from th e crisis been so slow a nd erratic?  Historically, 
recessions have typically sowed the seeds of their own recoveries as reduced spending on 
investment, housing, and consumer durables generates pent-up dema nd.  As the business 
cycle bottoms out and confidence returns, this pent-up demand, often augmented by the 
effects of stimulative monetary and fiscal policies, is met thro ugh increased production 
and hiring.  Increased production in turn  boosts business revenues and household 
incomes and provides further impetus to business and household spending.  Improving 
income prospects and balance sheets also  make households and businesses more 
creditworthy, and financial institutions beco me more willing to lend.  Normally, these - 5 - 
 
 
 developments create a virtuous circle of  rising incomes and profits, more supportive 
financial and credit conditions, and lower uncertainty, allowing the process of recovery to 
develop momentum. 
These restorative forces are at work today, and they will continue to promote 
recovery over time.  Unfortuna tely, the recession, besides bei ng extraordinarily severe as 
well as global in scope, was also unusual in being associated with both a very deep slump 
in the housing market and a hist oric financial crisis.  These two features of the downturn, 
individually and in combination, have acted to slow the natural recovery process.   
Notably, the housing sector has been a signi ficant driver of recovery from most 
recessions in the United States since World War II, but this time --with an overhang of 
distressed and foreclosed properties, tight credit conditions for bu ilders and potential 
homebuyers, and ongoing concerns by both potential borrowers and lenders about 
continued house price declines --the rate of new home cons truction has remained at less 
than one-third of its pre-crisis level.  The low level of construction has implications not 
only for builders but for providers of a wide  range of goods and services related to 
housing and homebuilding.  Moreover, even as tight credit for some borrowers has been 
one of the factors restraining housing recovery, the weakness of the housing sector has in 
turn had adverse effects on financial markets a nd on the flow of credit.  For example, the 
sharp declines in house prices  in some areas have left many homeowners “underwater” 
on their mortgages, creating financial hardsh ip for households and, through their effects 
on rates of mortgage delinquency and default, stress for financial institutions as well.  
Financial pressures on financial institutions and households have cont ributed, in turn, to 
greater caution in the extensi on of credit and to slower gr owth in consumer spending. - 6 - 
 
 
 I have already noted the central role of  the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 in 
sparking the recession.  As I also noted, a grea t deal has been done and is being done to 
address the causes and effects of  the crisis, including a subs tantial program of financial 
reform, and conditions in the U.S. banking sy stem and financial markets have improved 
significantly overall.  Neverthe less, financial stress has been and continues to be a 
significant drag on the recovery, both here and abroad.  Bouts of shar p volatility and risk 
aversion in markets have recently re-emerg ed in reaction to concerns about both 
European sovereign debts and developments rela ted to the U.S. fiscal  situation, including 
the recent downgrade of the U.S. long-term  credit rating by one of the major rating 
agencies and the controversy c oncerning the raising of the U.S.  federal debt ceiling.  It is 
difficult to judge by how much these developm ents have affected economic activity thus 
far, but there seems little doubt that they have hurt household and business confidence 
and that they pose ongoing risks to growth.  The Federal Reserve continues to monitor 
developments in financial markets and institutio ns closely and is in frequent contact with 
policymakers in Europe and elsewhere. 
Monetary policy must be responsive to ch anges in the economy and, in particular, 
to the outlook for growth and inflation.  As  I mentioned earlier, the recent data have 
indicated that economic growth during the first half of this year was considerably slower 
than the Federal Open Market Committee had be en expecting, and th at temporary factors 
can account for only a portion of the econom ic weakness that we have observed.  
Consequently, although we expect a moderate  recovery to continue and indeed to 
strengthen over time, the Committee has marked down its outlook for the likely pace of growth over coming quarters.  With comm odity prices and other import prices - 7 - 
 
 
 moderating and with longer-term inflation ex pectations remaining stable, we expect 
inflation to settle, over coming quart ers, at levels at or below th e rate of 2 percent, or a bit 
less, that most Committee participants view as  being consistent with our dual mandate.   
In light of its current outlook, the Comm ittee recently decided to provide more 
specific forward guidance about its  expectations for the future path of the federal funds 
rate.  In particular, in the statement fo llowing our meeting earlier this month, we 
indicated that economic conditions--including low rates of resour ce utilization and a 
subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally 
low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013.  Th at is, in what the 
Committee judges to be the most likely scenario s for resource utiliza tion and inflation in 
the medium term, the target for the federal f unds rate would be held at its current low 
levels for at least two more years.  
In addition to refining our forward guidan ce, the Federal Reserve has a range of 
tools that could be used to provide additional monetary stimulus.  We discussed the 
relative merits and costs of such tools at our August meeting.  We will continue to 
consider those and other pertinent issues, including of course economic and financial 
developments, at our meeting in September, which has been scheduled for two days (the 
20th and the 21st) instead of one to allo w a fuller discussion.  The Committee will 
continue to assess the economi c outlook in light of incoming information and is prepared 
to employ its tools as appropriate to promot e a stronger economic recovery in a context 
of price stability.

 Economic Policy and Longer-Term Growth in the United States 
 The financial crisis and its aftermat h have posed severe challenges around the 
globe, particularly in the advanced industrial economies.  Thus far I have reviewed some 
of those challenges, offered some diagnoses for the slow economic recovery in the United 
States, and briefly discussed th e policy response by the Federal Reserve.  However, this 
conference is focused on longer-run economic growth, and appropria tely so, given the 
fundamental importance of long-term growth  rates in the determination of living 
standards.  In that spirit, let me turn now to a brief discussion of the longer-run prospects 
for the U.S. economy and the role of econom ic policy in shaping those prospects. 
 Notwithstanding the severe difficulties we currently face, I do not expect the long-run growth potential of the U.S. economy to  be materially affected by the crisis and 
the recession if--and I stress if--our country takes the necessa ry steps to secure that 
outcome.  Over the medium term, housing activity will stabilize and begin to grow again, 
if for no other reason than that ongoing popul ation growth and household formation will 
ultimately demand it.  Good, proactive housing po licies could help speed that process.  
Financial markets and institutions have already made considerable progress toward normalization, and I anticipate that the financia l sector will continue  to adapt to ongoing 
reforms while still performing its vital intermediation functions.  Households will continue to strengthen their ba lance sheets, a process that will  be sped up considerably if 
the recovery accelerates but that will move forw ard in any case.  Businesses will continue 
to invest in new capital, a dopt new technologies, and build on the productivity gains of 
the past several years.  I ha ve confidence that our European colleagues fully appreciate 
what is at stake in the difficult issues they  are now confronting and that, over time, they - 9 - 
 
 
 will take all necessary and appropriate step s to address those issues effectively and 
comprehensively.     
This economic healing will take a while, and there may be setbacks along the 
way.  Moreover, we will need to remain alert to risks to the recovery, including financial 
risks.  However, with one possible exception on which I will elabor ate in a moment, the 
healing process should not leave major scars.  Notwithstanding the trauma of the crisis 
and the recession, the U.S. economy remains the largest in the world, with a highly 
diverse mix of industries and a degree of in ternational competitiveness that, if anything, 
has improved in recent years.  Our economy re tains its traditional advantages of a strong 
market orientation, a robust entrepreneuria l culture, and flexible capital and labor 
markets.  And our country remains a technol ogical leader, with many of the world’s 
leading research universities and the highest spending on re search and development of 
any nation.  
Of course, the United States faces many growth challenges.  Our population is 
aging, like those of many other advanced ec onomies, and our society will have to adapt 
over time to an older workforce.  Our K-12 educational system, despite considerable strengths, poorly serves a s ubstantial portion of ou r population.  The costs of health care 
in the United States are the highest in th e world, without fully co mmensurate results in 
terms of health outcomes.  But all of these long-term issues were well known before the 
crisis; efforts to address these problems have been ongoing, and these efforts will 
continue and, I hope, intensify.  The quality of economic policymaking in the United States will heavily influence the nation’s longer-term prosp ects.  To allow the economy to grow at its full potential, - 10 - 
 
 
 policymakers must work to promote macr oeconomic and financial stability; adopt 
effective tax, trade, and regulatory policie s; foster the development of a skilled 
workforce; encourage productive investme nt, both private and public; and provide 
appropriate support for research and de velopment and for the adoption of new 
technologies. 
The Federal Reserve has a role in prom oting the longer-term performance of the 
economy.  Most importantly, monetary policy th at ensures that inflation remains low and 
stable over time contributes to long-run macroeconomic and financial stability.  Low and 
stable inflation improves the functioning of markets, making them more effective at 
allocating resources; and it allo ws households and businesses to plan for the future 
without having to be unduly concerned with  unpredictable movements in the general 
level of prices.  The Federal Reserve also fosters macroeconomic and financial stability 
in its role as a financial regul ator, a monitor of overall fina ncial stability, and a liquidity 
provider of last resort. 
Normally, monetary or fiscal policies ai med primarily at promoting a faster pace 
of economic recovery in the ne ar term would not be expected  to significantly affect the 
longer-term performance of the economy.  Ho wever, current circumstances may be an 
exception to that standard view--the exception to which I alluded ear lier.  Our economy is 
suffering today from an extraordinarily hi gh level of long-term unemployment, with 
nearly half of the unemployed having been out  of work for more than six months.  Under 
these unusual circumstances, policies that prom ote a stronger recovery in the near term 
may serve longer-term objectives as well.  In the short term, putting people back to work 
reduces the hardships inflicted by difficult economic times and helps ensure that our - 11 - 
 
 
 economy is producing at its full po tential rather than  leaving productive resources fallow.  
In the longer term, minimizing the durat ion of unemployment supports a healthy 
economy by avoiding some of the erosion of sk ills and loss of attachment to the labor 
force that is often associated  with long-term unemployment. 
Notwithstanding this observation, which adds  urgency to the need to achieve a 
cyclical recovery in employment, most of  the economic policies that support robust 
economic growth in the long run are outside th e province of the central bank.  We have 
heard a great deal lately about federal fiscal  policy in the United States, so I will close 
with some thoughts on that topic, focusing on the role of fiscal policy in promoting 
stability and growth.  
To achieve economic and financial stabilit y, U.S. fiscal policy must be placed on 
a sustainable path that ensures that debt relati ve to national income is at least stable or, 
preferably, declining over time.  As I have  emphasized on previous occasions, without 
significant policy changes, the finances of the federal government will inevitably spiral 
out of control, risking severe economic and financial damage.1  The increasing fiscal 
burden that will be associated with the agi ng of the population and the ongoing rise in the 
costs of health care make prompt and decisive  action in this area all the more critical. 
Although the issue of fiscal sustainability must urgently be addressed, fiscal 
policymakers should not, as a consequence, disregard the fragility of the current economic recovery.  Fortunately, the two goals  of achieving fiscal sustainability--which 
is the result of responsible policies set in place for the longer term--and avoiding the 
creation of fiscal headwinds for the current r ecovery are not incompatible.  Acting now to

 put in place a credible plan for reducing futu re deficits over the longer term, while being 
attentive to the implications of fiscal choices  for the recovery in th e near term, can help 
serve both objectives. 
Fiscal policymakers can also promote stronger economic performance through the 
design of tax policies and spending programs.  To the fullest extent possible, our nation’s 
tax and spending policies should increase incen tives to work and to save, encourage 
investments in the skills of our workforce, stimulate private capital formation, promote 
research and development, and provide n ecessary public infrastructure.  We cannot 
expect our economy to grow its way out of our  fiscal imbalances, but a more productive 
economy will ease the tradeo ffs that we face.   
Finally, and perhaps most challenging, the country would be well served by a 
better process for making fiscal decisions.  The negotiations that took place over the 
summer disrupted financial markets and pr obably the economy as well, and similar 
events in the future could, over time, seri ously jeopardize the willingness of investors 
around the world to hold U.S. financial assets  or to make direct investments in job-
creating U.S. businesses.  Although detail s would have to be negotiated, fiscal 
policymakers could consider developing a more  effective process that sets clear and 
transparent budget goals, together with budget m echanisms to establis h the credibility of 
those goals.  Of course, formal budget goals and mechanisms do not replace the need for 
fiscal policymakers to make the difficult choi ces that are needed to put the country’s 
fiscal house in order, which means that public  understanding of and support for the goals 
of fiscal policy are crucial. 
Economic policymakers face a range of difficult decisions, relating to both the - 13 - 
 
 
 short-run and long-run challenges we face.  I have no doubt, however, that those 
challenges can be met, and that the fundame ntal strengths of our economy will ultimately 
reassert themselves.  The Federal Reserve will  certainly do all that it can to help restore 
high rates of growth and employment  in a context of price stability.

at  
 
“Regulation of Systemic Risk ,” a conference cosponsored by the Federal Reserve Board 
and the Journal of Money, Credit and Banking  
 
Washington , D.C.  
 
 
September 15 , 2011   Distinguished guests, I would like to welcome you to this conference on the 
“Regulation of Systemic Risk, ” which is jointly sponsored by the Federal Reserve Board 
and the Journal of Money, Credit and Banking .1  It is the fourth conference in a series 
that was initiated in 2005  and is held every two years .  These conferences support 
original  research on topics that are highly relevant for the Federal Reserve’s public policy 
mission.  Conference proceedings are subsequently published in special issues of the 
journal and disseminate d to researchers at central banks and academic institutions 
worldwide.  
 While the previous three conferences focused on monetary policy  issues , the 
papers presented at this conference relate  to the Federal Reserve’s duty to maintain  
financial stability and contain systemic risk.  The Dodd -Frank Wall Street Reform and 
Consumer Protection Act now requires the Federal Reserve to take a macroprudential 
approach to financial regulation --that is, to consider the health of the financial sys tem as 
well as the health of individual firms and markets . 
 The recent financial crisis has spurred a great deal of research on its causes and, 
more broadly , on the topic of systemic risk and its regulation .  This research is of critical  
importance.  It can inform the design and implement ation of macroprudential regulations 
and policies , and I suspect no one  in this audience need s to be convinced that we must get 
this right .  The nine papers at this conference make  a variety of welcome contributions in 
this area.   Two focus on an important aspect  of the recent financial crisis --namely , the

rise and fall of mortgage securitization  and associated swings  in real estate lending.2  
Other papers  study the causes  and indicators  of systemic risk more generally and look at 
how well macroprudential regulations and policies can address those causes.3  Finally, 
several papers examine specific regulations from a macroprudential perspective, 
including capital requirements  and risk retention rules for  securitization .4     
 The discussants ’ remarks, the general discussions, and the policy panel will surely 
be very helpful in identifying fruitful directions for further research.  I welcome you to 
the Federal Reserve and wish you a stimulating and productive conference.

The Economic Recovery and Economic Policy 
   
Remarks by 
 
Ben S. Bernanke 
Chairman 
 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
 
at 
 
The Economic Club of New York 
 
New York, New York 
       
November 20, 2012 
 
  
Good afternoon.  I am pleased to join the New York Economic Club for lunch 
today.  I know that many of you and your frie nds and neighbors are still recovering from 
the effects of Hurricane Sandy, and I want to  let you know that our  thoughts are with 
everyone who has suffered during the storm and its aftermath.   
My remarks today will focus on the reas ons for the disappointingly slow pace of 
economic recovery in the United States and th e policy actions that have been taken by the 
Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to support the economy.  In addition, I will discuss some important economic challenges our country faces as we close out 2012 and 
move into 2013--in particular , the challenge of putting fede ral government finances on a 
sustainable path in the longer run while avoiding actions that would endanger the 
economic recovery in the near term. 
The Recovery from the Financial Crisis and Recession 
The economy has continued to recover from the financial crisis and recession, but 
the pace of recovery has been slower than FOMC participants and many others had hoped 
or anticipated when I spoke here about th ree years ago.  Indeed, since the recession 
trough in mid-2009, growth in real gross dom estic product (GDP) has averaged only a 
little more than 2 percent per year.   
Similarly, the job market has improved over the past three year s, but at a slow 
pace.  The unemployment rate, which peaked  at 10 percent in the fall of 2009, has since 
come down 2 percentage point s to just below 8 percent.  This decline is obviously 
welcome, but it has taken a long time to ach ieve that progress, and the unemployment 
rate is still well above both its  level prior to the onset of the recession and the level that 
my colleagues and I think can be sustained once a full recovery has been achieved.   
 - 2 -
Moreover, many other features of the jobs ma rket, including the historically high level of 
long-term unemployment, the large number of people working part time because they 
have not been able to find full-time jobs, and the decline in labor  force participation, 
reinforce the conclusion that we have some way to go before the labor market can be 
deemed healthy again. 
Meanwhile, inflation has generally rema ined subdued.  As is often the case, 
inflation has been pushed up and down in recen t years by fluctuations in the price of 
crude oil and other globally traded commoditie s, including the increase in farm prices 
brought on by this summer’s drought.  But w ith longer-term inflation expectations 
remaining stable, the ebbs and flows in commod ity prices have had only transitory effects 
on inflation.  Indeed, since the recovery began about three years ago, consumer price 
inflation, as measured by the personal cons umption expenditures (PCE) price index, has 
averaged almost exactly 2 percent, whic h is the FOMC’s longer-run objective for 
inflation.1  Because ongoing slack in labor a nd product markets should continue to 
restrain wage and price increases, and with th e public’s inflation expectations continuing 
to be well anchored,  inflation over the next fe w years is likely to remain close to or a 
little below the Committee’s objective. 
As background for our monetary policy  decisionmaking, we at the Federal 
Reserve have spent a good deal of effort attempting to understand the reasons why the 
economic recovery has not been stronger.  St udies of previous financial crises provide 
one helpful place to start.2  This literature has found that severe financial crises--
                                                 
1 Inflation excluding food and energy has averaged a little less, about 1-1/2 percent, over this period.   
2 See Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff (2009), This Time Is Different:  Eight Centuries of 
Financial Folly  (Princeton:  Princeton University Press); Mo ritz Schularick and Alan M. Taylor (2012), 
  
 - 3 -
particularly those associated  with housing booms and busts--have often been associated 
with many years of subsequent weak performance.  While th is result allows for many 
interpretations, one possibility is that financia l crises, or the deep recessions that typically 
accompany them, may reduce an economy’s poten tial growth rate, at  least for a time. 
The accumulating evidence does appear consis tent with the financial crisis and 
the associated recession having reduced th e potential growth rate of our economy 
somewhat during the past few years.  In pa rticular, slower growth of potential output 
would help explain why the unemployment rate has declined in the face of the relatively 
modest output gains we have seen during the recovery.  Output normally has to increase 
at about its longer-term trend ju st to create enough jobs to absorb new entrants to the 
labor market, and faster-than-trend growth is  usually needed to reduce unemployment.  
So the fact that unemployment has declined in recent years despite economic growth at 
about 2 percent suggests that the growth rate of potential output must have recently been 
lower than the roughly 2-1/2 per cent rate that appeared to be  in place before the crisis.3

3 That said, GDP growth in excess of potential is probably not the whole explanation for the decline in 
unemployment.  Some of the decline in unemployment during the recovery could also reflect a reversal of 
the especially large increases that oc curred during the deepest part of the recession, when firms appeared to 
cut their workforces by  greater numbers than would normally be as sociated with the decline in GDP.  (For 
a discussion, see Ben S. Bernanke (2012), “Recent Deve lopments in the Labor Mark et,” speech delivered at 
the National Association for Business Economics 28th Annual Economic Policy Conference, Arlington, 
Va., March 26,   www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20120326a.htm.)  A reduction in the number of people receiving extended or emerge ncy unemployment insurance benefits may have 
contributed to the decline in unemployment as well.    
 - 4 -
There are a number of ways in which the financial crisis could have slowed the 
rate of growth of the economy’s potential.  For example, the extraordinarily severe job 
losses that followed the cris is, especially in housing-re lated industries, may have 
exacerbated for a time the extent of mismatch  between the jobs available and the skills 
and locations of the unemployed.  Meanwh ile, the very high level of long-term 
unemployment has probably led to some loss of skills and labor force attachment among 
those workers.  These factors may have pushed up to some degree the so-called natural rate of unemployment--the rate of unemplo yment that can be sustained under normal 
conditions--and reduced labor force participa tion as well.  The pace of productivity 
gains--another key determinant of growth in potential output--may also have been 
restrained by the crisis, as business investment declined sh arply during the recession; and 
increases in risk aversion a nd uncertainty, together with ti ght credit conditions, may have 
impeded the commercial application of new t echnologies and slowed the pace of business 
formation. 
Importantly, however, although the natio n’s potential output may have grown 
more slowly than expected in recent years, this slowi ng seems at best a partial 
explanation of the disappoin ting pace of the economic reco very.  In particular, even 
though the natural rate of unemployment may have increased somewhat, a variety of 
evidence suggests that any such increase has been modest, and that  substantial slack 
remains in the labor market.  For example, th e slow pace of employme nt growth has been 
widespread across industries a nd regions of the country.  Th at pattern suggests a broad-
based shortfall in demand rather than a substantial increase in mismatch between 
available jobs and workers, because greater  mismatch would imply that the demand for  
 - 5 -
workers would be strong in some regions and industries, not weak almost across the 
board.  Likewise, if a mismatch of jobs and workers is the predominant problem, we 
would expect to see wage pressures devel oping in those regions and industries where 
labor demand is strong; in fact, wage gains have been quite subdued in most industries 
and parts of the country.4  Indeed, as I indicated earl ier, the consensus among my 
colleagues on the FOMC is that the unemploy ment rate is still we ll above its longer-run 
sustainable level, perhaps by 2 to  2-1/2 percentage points or so.5   
A critical question, then, is  why significant slack in the job market remains three 
years after the recovery began.  A likely expl anation, which I will discuss further, is that 
the economy has been faced with a variety of headwinds that have hindered what 
otherwise might have been a stronger cy clical rebound.  If so, we may take some 
encouragement from the likelihood that there are potentially two s ources of faster GDP 
growth in the future.  First, the effects of th e crisis on potential output should fade as the 
economy continues to heal.6  And second, if the headwinds be gin to dissipate, as I expect, 
                                                 
4 In addition, while the changing relationship betwee n job vacancies and unempl oyment--the shift in the 
Beveridge curve--probably does point to some greater difficulty matching jobs with workers, factors other 
than mismatch likely explain some of that shift.  For example, evidence suggests that firms tend to become 
more selective in hiring when their hiring needs are not urgent.  For further discussion of these labor market issues, see Bernanke, “Recent Developmen ts,” in note 3 and the references cited therein.  See also Edward 
P. Lazear and James R. Spletzer (2012), “The United St ates Labor Market:  Status Quo or a New Normal?” 
paper delivered at “The Changing Policy Landscape,” a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson Hole, Wyo., August 30-September 1, 
www.kansascityfed.org/publicat/sympos/2012/el-js.pdf. 
5 In the September 2012 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), the central tendency of FOMC 
participants’ estimates of the long-run normal rate of  unemployment ranged from 5.2 to 6 percent.  The 
SEP is an addendum to the FOMC minutes and is available at Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2012), “Minutes of the Fe deral Open Market Committee, Septem ber 12-13, 2012,” press release, 
October 4, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20121004a.htm.  
6 For example, mismatch problems in the labor market should fade as the economy strengthens, a further 
rise in business investment would contribute to faster growth in the capital stock, and an improving 
economy should cause investors to become less risk averse.    
 - 6 -
growth should pick up furthe r as many who are currently une mployed or out of the labor 
force find work.    
Headwinds Affecting the Recovery 
What are the headwinds that have slow ed the return of our economy to full 
employment?  Some have come from the housin g sector.  Previous recoveries have often 
been associated with a vigorous rebound in  housing, as rising incomes and confidence 
and, often, a decline in mortgage  interest rates led to shar p increases in the demand for 
homes.7  But the housing bubble and its aftermath ha ve made this episode quite different.  
In the first half of the past decade, both housing prices and constr uction rose to what 
proved to be unsustainable levels, leading to a subsequent coll apse:  House prices 
declined almost one-third nationally from  2006 until early this y ear, construction of 
single-family homes fell two-thirds, and the number of construction jobs decreased by 
nearly one-third.  And, of course, the asso ciated surge in delinquencies on mortgages 
helped trigger the broader financial crisis. 
Recently, the housing market has shown some clear signs of improvement, as 
home sales, prices, and cons truction have all moved up sinc e early this year.  These 
developments are encouraging, and it seems lik ely that, on net, residential investment 
will be a source of economic growth and ne w jobs over the next couple of years.  
However, while historically low mortgage inte rest rates and the drop in home prices have 
made housing exceptionally affordable, a number of factors continue to prevent the sort 
of powerful housing recovery that has typically  occurred in the past.  Notably, lenders 
                                                 
7 In the recoveries following the 1975 and 1982 recessions, for example, residential construction directly 
contributed about 1 percentage point to GDP growth during the two years following the recession trough; indirect effects--through th e effect of home prices on consumer spending or through multiplier effects--no 
doubt added to the contribution.    
 - 7 -
have maintained tight terms and conditions  on mortgage loans, even for potential 
borrowers with relatively good credit.8  Lenders cite a number of factors affecting their 
decisions to extend credit, including ongoing uncertainties about the course of the 
economy, the housing market, and the regulator y environment.  Unfortunately, while 
some tightening of the terms of mortgage cred it was certainly an appropriate response to 
the earlier excesses, the pendulum appears to have swung too far, restraining the pace of 
recovery in the housing sector.   
Other factors slowing the recovery in housing include the fact that many people 
remain unable to buy homes despite low mortgage  rates; for example, about 20 percent of 
existing mortgage borrowers owe more on thei r mortgages than their houses are worth, 
making it more difficult for them to refinan ce or sell their homes.  Also, a substantial 
overhang of vacant homes, either for sale or in  the foreclosure pipeline, continues to hold 
down house prices and reduce the need for ne w construction.  While these headwinds on 
both the supply and demand sides of the housing market have clearly started to abate, the 
recovery in the housing sector is likely to remain moderate by historical standards. 
A second set of headwinds stems from th e financial conditions facing potential 
borrowers in credit and capital markets.  Afte r the financial system seized up in late 2008 
and early 2009, global economic activity cont racted sharply, and credit and capital 
markets suffered significant damage.  Although dramatic actions by governments and 
central banks around the world helped these markets to stabilize and begin recovering, 
                                                 
8 For example, according to the Apr il 2012 Senior Loan Of ficer Opinion Survey on  Bank Lending, about 
one-half of lenders reported that they were “somewhat less likely” or “much less likely” than in 2006 to 
originate a mortgage to a borrower with a FICO score of 680 and a 10 percent down payment.  The complete survey is available on the Board’s website at 
www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/snloansurvey/201205/default.htm.

tight credit and a high degree of  risk aversion have restrained economic growth in the 
United States and in ot her countries as well. 
Measures of the condition of U.S. fina ncial markets and in stitutions suggest 
gradual but significant progress has been achieved since the crisis.  For example, credit 
spreads on corporate bonds and syndicated loan s have narrowed considerably, and equity 
prices have recovered most of their losses.  In addition, indicators  of market stress and 
illiquidity--such as spreads in short-term funding markets--have ge nerally returned to 
levels near those seen before the crisis .  One gauge of the overall improvement in 
financial markets is the National Financial Conditions Index maintained by the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Chicago.  The index shows th at financial conditions, viewed as a whole, 
are now about as accommodative as they were in the spring of 2007. 
In spite of this broad improvement, the ha rm inflicted by the financial crisis has 
yet to be fully repaired in important segments  of the financial sector.  One example is the 
continued weakness in some categories of bank lending.  Banks’ capital positions and 
overall asset quality have improved substant ially over the past several years, and, over 
time, these balance sheet improvements will po sition banks to extend considerably more 
credit to bank-dependent borrowers.  Ind eed, some types of bank credit, such as 
commercial and industrial loans, have expanded notably in recent quart ers.  Nonetheless, 
banks have been conservative in exte nding loans to many consumers and some 
businesses, likely even beyond the restrictions  on the supply of mo rtgage lending that I 
noted earlier.  This caution in lending by banks reflects, among other factors, their 
continued desire to guard against the risks of further economic weakness.   
 - 9 -
A prominent risk at present--and a majo r source of financial headwinds over the 
past couple of years--is the fi scal and financial situation in  Europe.  This situation, of 
course, was not anticipated when  the U.S. recovery began in 2009.  The elevated levels of 
stress in European economies and uncertain ty about how the problems there will be 
resolved are adding to the risks that U.S.  financial institutions, businesses, and 
households must consider when making lend ing and investment decisions.  Negative 
sentiment regarding Europe appears to have weighed on U.S. equity prices and prevented 
U.S. credit spreads from narrowing even furthe r.  Weaker economic conditions in Europe 
and other parts of the world have also weighed on U.S. e xports and corporate earnings. 
 Policymakers in Europe have taken some  important steps recently, and in doing 
so have contributed to some welcome easing of financial conditions.  In particular, the 
European Central Bank’s new Outright Mone tary Transactions program, under which it 
could purchase the sovereign debt of vulnera ble euro-area countries who agree to meet 
prescribed conditions, has helped ease market concerns about those countries.  European 
governments have also taken steps to strength en their financial firewalls and to move 
toward greater fiscal and banking union.  Fu rther improvement in global financial 
conditions will depend in part on the extent  to which European policymakers follow 
through on these initiatives.  A third headwind to the recovery--and one  that may intensify in force in coming 
quarters--is U.S. fiscal policy.  Although fi scal policy at the federal level was quite 
expansionary during the recession and early in  the recovery, as the recovery proceeded, 
the support provided for the economy by federal fiscal actions was increasingly offset by 
the adverse effects of tight budget conditions  for state and local governments.  In  
 - 10 -
response to a large and sustained decline in their tax revenues, state and local 
governments have cut about 600,000 jobs on ne t since the third quarter of 2008 while 
reducing real expenditures for infras tructure projects by 20 percent.   
More recently, the situation has to some extent reversed:  The drag on economic 
growth from state and local fiscal policy has diminished as revenues have improved, 
easing the pressures for further spending cuts or tax increases.  In contrast, the phasing-
out of earlier stimulus programs and policy actions to reduce the federal budget deficit 
have led federal fiscal policy to begin restra ining GDP growth.  Indeed, under almost any 
plausible scenario, next year the drag from federal fiscal policy on GDP growth will outweigh the positive effects on growth from fis cal expansion at the state and local level.  
However, the overall effect of federal fiscal  policy on the economy, both in the near term 
and in the longer run, remains quite uncerta in and depends on how policymakers meet 
two daunting fiscal challenges--one by the st art of the new year and the other no later 
than the spring. 
Upcoming Fiscal Challenges 
What are these looming challenges?  Fi rst, the Congress a nd the Administration 
will need to protect the economy from the full brunt of the severe fiscal tightening at the 
beginning of next year that is built into cu rrent law--the so-calle d fiscal cliff.  The 
realization of all of the automatic tax increases and spending cuts that make up the fiscal cliff, absent offsetting changes, would pose a substantial threat to the recovery--indeed, 
by the reckoning of the Congr essional Budget Office (CBO) and that of many outside 
observers, a fiscal shock of  that size would send the economy toppling back into 
recession.  Second, early in the new year it will be necessary to approve an increase in the  
 - 11 -
federal debt limit to avoid any possibility  of a catastrophic de fault on the nation’s 
Treasury securities and other obligations.  As you will recall, the threat  of default in the 
summer of 2011 fueled economic uncertainty  and badly damaged confidence, even 
though an agreement ultimately was reached.  A failure to reach a timely agreement this 
time around could impose even heavier economic and financial costs. 
As fiscal policymakers face these critical decisions, they should keep two 
objectives in mind.  First, as I think is wi dely appreciated by now, the federal budget is 
on an unsustainable path.  The budget deficit, which peaked at about 10 percent of GDP in 2009 and now stands at about  7 percent of GDP, is expect ed to narrow further in the 
coming years as the economy continues to recover.  However, the CBO projects that, under a plausible set of policy assumptions, the budget deficit would still be greater than 
4 percent of GDP in 2018, assuming the econom y has returned to it s potential by then.  
Moreover, under the CBO projection, the defi cit and the ratio of federal debt to GDP 
would subsequently return to an upward trend.
9  Of course, we shoul d all understand that 
long-term projections of ever-increasing de ficits will never actually come to pass, 
because the willingness of lenders to con tinue to fund the government can only be 
sustained by responsible fiscal  plans and actions.  A credib le framework to set federal 
fiscal policy on a stable path--f or example, one on which the ra tio of federal debt to GDP 
eventually stabilizes or declin es--is thus urgently needed to ensure longer-term economic 
growth and stability. 
                                                 
9 This projection is the alternative fiscal scenario  in a CBO report from August of this year.  See 
Congressional Budget Office (2012), An Update to the Budget and Economic Outlook:  Fiscal Years 2012 
to 2022 (Washington:  CBO, August), available at www.cbo.gov/publication/43539.   
 - 12 -
Even as fiscal policymakers address the urgent issue of longer-run fiscal 
sustainability, they should not ignore a s econd key objective:  to avoid unnecessarily 
adding to the headwinds that are alrea dy holding back the economic recovery.  
Fortunately, the two objectives are fully compa tible and mutually reinforcing.  Preventing 
a sudden and severe contraction in fiscal policy early next ye ar will support the transition 
of the economy back to full employment; a stronger economy will in turn reduce the 
deficit and contribute to achie ving long-term fiscal sustaina bility.  At the same time, a 
credible plan to put the fede ral budget on a path th at will be sustainable in the long run 
could help keep longer-term interest rates low and boost household and business 
confidence, thereby supporti ng economic growth today. 
Coming together to find fiscal solutions will not be easy, but the stakes are high.  
Uncertainty about how the fiscal cliff, the ra ising of the debt limit, and the longer-term 
budget situation will be addre ssed appears already to be a ffecting private spending and 
investment decisions and may be contribu ting to an increased sense of caution in 
financial markets, with adverse effects on th e economy.  Continuing to  push off difficult 
policy choices will only prolong and intensify these uncertainties.  Moreover, while the 
details of whatever agreement is reached to  resolve the fiscal cliff are important, the 
economic confidence of both market participan ts and the general pub lic likely will also 
be influenced by the extent to which our political system proves able to deliver a 
reasonable solution with a minimum of un certainty and delay.  Finding long-term 
solutions that can win suffici ent political support to be enac ted may take some time, but 
meaningful progress toward th is end can be achieved now if  policymakers are willing to 
think creatively and work together constructively.  
 - 13 -
Monetary Policy  
Let me now turn briefl y to monetary policy. 
Monetary policy can do little to reverse the effects that the financial crisis may 
have had on the economy’s productive potential.  However, it has been able to provide an 
important offset to the headwinds that have  slowed the cyclical recovery.  As you know, 
the Federal Reserve took strong easing measur es during the financial crisis and recession, 
cutting its target for the fede ral funds rate--the traditional tool of monetary policy--to 
nearly zero by the end of 2008.  Since that  time, we have provided additional 
accommodation through two nontraditional polic y tools aimed at putting downward 
pressure on longer-term interest rates:  asse t purchases that reduce the supply of longer-
term securities outstanding in the market, a nd communication about th e future path of 
monetary policy. 
Most recently, after the September FO MC meeting, we announced that the 
Federal Reserve would purchase additional agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) 
and continue with the program to extend the maturity of our Treasury holdings.10  These 
additional asset purchases s hould put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates 
and make broader financial conditions more accommodative.11  Moreover, our purchases 
                                                 
10 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2012), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC 
Statement,” press release, September 13, 
www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20120913a.htm. 
11 One way in which our asset purchases affect the economy is through the so-called portfolio balance 
channel.  Because different classes of financial assets  are not perfect substitutes in investors’ portfolios, 
changes in the supplies of various assets available to private investors may affect the prices and yields of 
those assets.  Thus, the Federal Reserve’s purchases of  Treasury securities, for example, should raise the 
prices and lower the yields of those securities; moreover, as investors rebalance their portfolios by replacing the Treasury securities sold to the Federal Re serve with other assets, the prices of those other 
assets should rise and their yields decline as well.  An increase in our asset purchases may also act as a 
signal that we intend to pursue a persistently more accommodative polic y stance than prev iously thought, 
thereby lowering investors’ expectations for the future  path of the federal funds rate and putting additional 
downward pressure on longer-term interest rates.

of MBS, by bringing down mortgage rates,  provide support direc tly to housing and 
thereby help mitigate some of the headwinds  facing that sector.  In announcing this 
decision, we also indicated that we w ould continue purchasing MBS, undertake 
additional purchases of longer-term securities,  and employ our other policy tools until we 
judge that the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of 
price stability.   
Although it is still too early to assess the full effects of  our most recent policy 
actions, yields on corporate bonds and agency  MBS have fallen significantly, on balance, 
since the FOMC’s announcement.  More gene rally, research suggest s that our previous 
asset purchases have eased overall financia l conditions and provided meaningful support 
to the economic recovery in recent years.12 
In addition to announcing new purchases of  MBS, at our September meeting we 
extended our guidance for how long we expect  that exceptionally low levels for the 
federal funds rate will likely be warrant ed at least through the middle of 2015.  By

pushing the expected period of low rates further into the future, we are not saying that we 
expect the economy to remain weak until mid-20 15; rather, we expect --as we indicated in 
our September statement--that a highly accomm odative stance of monetary policy will 
remain appropriate for a considerable tim e after the economic recovery strengthens.13  In 
other words, we will want to be sure that the recovery is established before we begin to normalize policy.  We hope that such assura nces will reduce uncertainty and increase 
confidence among households and businesses,  thereby providing additional support for 
economic growth and job creation. 
Conclusion  
In sum, the U.S. economy continues to be  hampered by the lingering effects of the 
financial crisis on its pro ductive potential and by a numbe r of headwinds that have 
hindered the normal cyclical ad justment of the economy.  The Federal Reserve is doing 
its part by providing accommodative monetary  policy to promote a stronger economic 
recovery in a context of pri ce stability.  As I have said before, however, while monetary 
policy can help support the economic recovery, it is by no means a panacea for our economic ills.  Currently, uncertainties about th e situation in Europe and especially about 
the prospects for federal fiscal policy seem to  be weighing on the sp ending decisions of 
households and businesses as well as on financ ial conditions.  Such uncertainties will 
only be increased by discord and delay.  In c ontrast, cooperation and creativity to deliver 
fiscal clarity--in particular, a plan for resolving the natio n’s longer-term budgetary issues 
without harming the recovery--could help make the new year a very good one for the American economy.

Economic Prospects for the Long Run

Let me start by congratulating the gra duates and their parents.  The word 
“graduate” comes from the Latin word for “s tep.”  Graduation from college is only one 
step on a journey, but it is an importa nt one and well worth celebrating. 
I think everyone here appreciates what a special privilege each of you has enjoyed 
in attending a unique institution like Simon’ s Rock.  It is, to my knowledge, the only 
“early college” in the United States; many of you came here after the 10th or 11th grade 
in search of a different educational expe rience.  And with only about 400 students on 
campus, I am sure each of you has felt yourself to be part of a close-knit community.  
Most important, though, you have completed a curriculum that empha sizes creativity and 
independent critical thinking, habits of mind that I am sure will stay with you. 
What’s so important about creativity a nd critical thinking?  There are many 
answers.  I am an economist, so I will answer by talking first about our economic future--or your economic future, I should say, because each of you will have many years, I hope, 
to contribute to and benefit from an incr easingly sophisticated, complex, and globalized 
economy.  My emphasis today will be on prospe cts for the long run.  In particular, I will 
be looking beyond the very real challenges of economic recovery that we face today--
challenges that I have every confidence we will overcome--to speak, for a change, about economic growth as measured in decades, not months or quarters. 
Many factors affect the development of the economy, notably among them a 
nation’s economic and political institutions, but over long periods probably the most 
important factor is the pace of scientific a nd technological progress.  Between the days of 
the Roman Empire and when the Industrial Re volution took hold in Europe, the standard 
of living of the average pe rson throughout most of the world changed little from  - 2 -
generation to generation.  For centuries, many, if not most, people produced much of 
what they and their families consumed and neve r traveled far from where they were born.  
By the mid-1700s, however, growing scientific  and technical knowledge was beginning 
to find commercial uses.  Since then, accord ing to standard accounts, the world has 
experienced at least three ma jor waves of technological innov ation and its application.  
The first wave drove the growth of the early industrial era, which lasted from the mid-
1700s to the mid-1800s.  This period saw the i nvention of steam engines, cotton-spinning 
machines, and railroads.  These i nnovations, by introducing mechanization, 
specialization, and mass produc tion, fundamentally changed how and where goods were 
produced and, in the process, greatly increa sed the productivity of workers and reduced 
the cost of basic consumer goods.  The s econd extended wave of invention coincided 
with the modern industrial era,  which lasted from the mid-1 800s well into the years after 
World War II.  This era featured multiple innovations that radically changed everyday 
life, such as indoor plumbing, the harnessing of electricity for use in homes and factories, 
the internal combustion engine, antibiotics,  powered flight, telephones, radio, television, 
and many more.  The third era, whose roots go back at least to the 1940s but which began 
to enter the popular consciousness in the 1970s and 1980s, is defined by the information 
technology (IT) revolution, as well as fields  like biotechnology that improvements in 
computing helped make possible.  Of cour se, the IT revolution is still going on and 
shaping our world today. 
Now here’s a question--in fact, a key ques tion, I imagine, from your perspective.  
What does the future hold for the working li ves of today’s graduates?  The economic 
implications of the first two waves of innova tion, from the steam engine to the Boeing  - 3 -
747, were enormous.  These waves vastly expa nded the range of available products and 
the efficiency with which they could be produc ed.  Indeed, according to the best available 
data, output per person in the United States increased by approximately 30 times between 
1700 and 1970 or so, growth that has resulted in multiple transformations of our economy 
and society.1  History suggests that economic prospects during the coming decades 
depend on whether the most recent revolution, the IT revolution, has economic effects of 
similar scale and scope as the previous two.  But will it?   
I must report that not everyone thinks s o.  Indeed, some knowl edgeable observers 
have recently made the case that the IT revolut ion, as important as it surely is, likely will 
not generate the transformative economic effects that flowed  from the earlier 
technological revolutions.2  As a result, these observers argue, economic growth and 
change in coming decades likely will be noticeably slower than the pace to which 
Americans have become accustomed.  Such an outcome would have important social and 
political--as well as econ omic--consequences for our  country and the world. 
This provocative assessment of our econom ic future has attracted plenty of 
attention among economists and others as well.  Does it make sense?  Here’s one way to 
think more concretely about the argument th at the pessimists are making:  Fifty years 
ago, in 1963, I was a nine-year-old growing up in a middle-class home in a small town in 
South Carolina.  As a way of getting a handl e on the recent pace of economic change, it’s

interesting to ask how my family’s everyday life  back then differed from that of a typical 
family today.  Well, if I think about it, I could quickly come up with the Internet, 
cellphones, and microwave ovens as important conveniences that most of your families 
have today that my family lacked 50 years ago.  Health care has improved some since I 
was young; indeed, life expectancy  at birth in the United Stat es has risen from 70 years in 
1963 to 78 years today, although some of this improvement is probably due to better nutrition and generally higher leve ls of income rather than a dvances in medicine alone.  
Nevertheless, though my memory may be sel ective, it doesn’t seem to me that the 
differences in daily life between then a nd now are all that la rge.  Heating, air 
conditioning, cooking, and sanitation in my ch ildhood were not all that different from 
today.  We had a dishwasher, a washing mach ine, and a dryer.  My family owned a 
comfortable car with air condi tioning and a radio, and th e experience of commercial 
flight was much like today but without the long security lines.  For entertainment, we did 
not have the Internet or video games, as I mentioned, but we had plenty of books, radio, 
musical recordings, and a color TV (alt hough, I must acknowledge, the colors were 
garish and there were many fewer channels to choose from).   
The comparison of the world of 1963 with th at of today suggests quite substantial 
but perhaps not transformative economic cha nge since then.  But now let’s run this 
thought experiment back another 50 years, to 1913 (the year the Federal Reserve was 
created by the Congress, by the way), and co mpare how my grandparents and your great-
grandparents lived with how my family live d in 1963.  Life in 1913 was simply much 
harder for most Americans than it would be  later in the century.  Many people worked 
long hours at dangerous, dirt y, and exhausting jobs--up to 60 hours per week in  - 5 -
manufacturing, for example, and even more in agriculture.  Hous ework involved a great 
deal of drudgery; refrigerators, freezers, v acuum cleaners, electric stoves, and washing 
machines were not in general use, which s hould not be terribly su rprising since most 
urban households, and virtually a ll rural households, were not ye t wired for electricity.  In 
the entertainment sphere, Americans did not yet have access to commercial radio 
broadcasts and movies would be silent for another decade and a half.  Some people had 
telephones, but no long-distance service was available.  In  transportation, in 1913 Henry 
Ford was just beginning the mass production of the Model T automobile, railroads were powered by steam, and regular commercial ai r travel was quite a few years away.  
Importantly, life expectancy at birth in 1913 was only 53 years, reflecting not only the 
state of medical science at the time--infec tion-fighting antibiotics and vaccines for many 
deadly diseases would not be developed for se veral more decades--but also deficiencies 
in sanitation and nutrition.  This was quite a different world than the one in which I grew 
up in 1963 or in which we live today. 
The purpose of these comparisons is to make concrete the argument made by 
some economists, that the economic and t echnological transforma tion of the past 50 
years, while significant, does not match the ch anges of the 50 years--or, for that matter, 
the 100 years--before that.  Extrapolating to the future, the conclusion some have drawn 
is that the sustainable pace of economic growth and change and the associated 
improvement in living standards will likely slow further, as our most recent technological 
revolution, in computers and IT, will not transf orm our lives as dramatically as previous 
revolutions have.    - 6 -
Well, that’s sort of depressi ng.  Is it true, then, as baseba ll player Yogi Berra said, 
that the future ain’t what it used to be?  Nobody really know s; as Berra also astutely 
observed, it’s tough to make predictions, especi ally about the future.  But there are some 
good arguments on the other side of this debate.  
First, innovation, almost by definition, i nvolves ideas that no one has yet had, 
which means that forecasts of future technolog ical change can be, and often are, wildly 
wrong.  A safe prediction, I think, is that human innovation and creativity will continue; 
it is part of our very nature.  Another pr ediction, just as safe, is that people will 
nevertheless continue to forecast the end of innovation.  The famous British economist 
John Maynard Keynes observed as much in th e midst of the Great Depression more than 
80 years ago.  He wrote then, “We are sufferi ng just now from a bad attack of economic 
pessimism.  It is common to hear people say that the epoch of enormous economic 
progress which characterised the 19th century is  over; that the rapid improvement in the 
standard of life is now going to slow down.”3  Sound familiar?  By the way, Keynes 
argued at that time that such a view was shortsighted and, in characterizing what he 
called “the economic possibiliti es for our grandchildren,” he  predicted that income per 
person, adjusted for inflation, could rise as much as four to eight times by 2030.  His guess looks pretty good; income per person in  the United States today is roughly six 
times what it was in 1930. 
Second, not only are scientific and techni cal innovation themselves inherently 
hard to predict, so are the long-run practi cal consequences of innovation for our economy 
and our daily lives.  Indeed, some would say that  we are still in the early days of the IT

revolution; after all, computing speeds a nd memory have increased many times over in 
the 30-plus years since the first personal co mputers came on the market, and fields like 
biotechnology are also advancing rapidly.  Moreover, even as the basic technologies 
improve, the commercial applications of thes e technologies have ar guably thus far only 
scratched the surface.  Consider, for example, the potential for IT and biotechnology to improve health care, one of the largest a nd most important sectors of our economy.  A 
strong case can be made that the modernizati on of health-care IT sy stems would lead to 
better-coordinated, more effec tive, and less costly patient care than we have today, 
including greater responsivene ss of medical practice to th e latest research findings.
4  
Robots, lasers, and other advanced technol ogies are improving surgical outcomes, and 
artificial intelligence systems are being used  to improve diagnoses and chart courses of 
treatment.  Perhaps even more revolutionary  is the trend toward so-called personalized 
medicine, which would tailor medical treatments for each patient based on information 
drawn from that individual’s genetic code.  Taken together, such advances could lead to 
another jump in life expectancy and improved health at older ages.   
Other promising areas for the applica tion of new technologies include the 
development of cleaner energy--for exampl e, the harnessing of wind, wave, and solar 
power and the development of electric and hybr id vehicles--as well as potential further 
advances in communications and robotics.  I’m sure that I can’t imagine all of the 
possibilities, but historians of science have commented on our collective tendency to

Optimistic Perspective,” International Productivity Monitor,  Spring, pp. 3-12.  - 8 -
overestimate the short-term effects of new technologies while underestimating their 
longer-term potential.5   
Finally, pessimists may be paying too lit tle attention to the strength of the 
underlying economic and social forces that ge nerate innovation in the modern world.  
Invention was once the province of  the isolated scientist or ti nkerer.  The transmission of 
new ideas and the adaptation of the best new insights to commercial uses were slow and 
erratic.  But all of that is ch anging radically.  We live on a pl anet that is becoming richer 
and more populous, and in which not only th e most advanced economies but also large 
emerging market nations like China and India increasingly see their economic futures as tied to technological innovation.  In that c ontext, the number of trained scientists and 
engineers is increasing rapidl y, as are the resources for research being provided by 
universities, governments, and th e private sector.  Moreover, because of the Internet and 
other advances in communications, collaborati on and the exchange of ideas take place at 
high speed and with little regard for geographi c distance.  For example, research papers 
are now disseminated and critiqued almost inst antaneously rather than  after publication in 
a journal several years after they are written.  And, importantly, as trade and globalization 
increase the size of the potential market for new products, the possible economic rewards 
for being first with an innovative pro duct or process are growing rapidly.
6  In short, both 
humanity’s capacity to innovate and the incen tives to innovate are gr eater today than at 
any other time in history.

Well, what does all this have to do with creativity and critical  thinking, which is 
where I started?  The history of techno logical innovation and economic development 
teaches us that change is the only constant.  During your working lives, you will have to 
reinvent yourselves many times.  Success and satisfaction will not come from mastering a 
fixed body of knowledge but from constant adaptation and creativity in a rapidly 
changing world.  Engaging with and applying ne w technologies will be  a crucial part of 
that adaptation.  Your work here at Simon’ s Rock, and the intellect ual skills, creativity, 
and imagination that that work has fostere d, are the best possible preparation for these 
challenges.  And while I have emphasized tec hnological and scientific  advances today, it 
is important to remember that the arts and humanities facilitate new and creative thinking as well, while helping us to draw meaning th at goes beyond the purely material aspects of 
our lives.  I wish you the best in facing the di fficult but exciting challe nges that lie ahead.  
Congratulations.

Addressing Workforce Development Challenges in Low -Income Communities  
   
Remarks by  
 
Janet L. Yellen  
 
Chair  
 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  
 
at 
 
“Creating a Just Economy ,” the 2017 annual conference of the  
National Community Reinvestment Coalition   
 
Washington, D.C. 
  
 
 
   
March 28, 2017  
  
Thank you for this opportunity to be part of the National Community 
Reinvestment Coalition ’s annual conference.  It is a pleasure to address a group of 
organizations committed to improving the lives of low - and moderate -income Americans 
and strengthening communities.  I am especially pleas ed to be with you in 2017, which 
marks the 40th anniversary of the Community  Reinvestment Act  (CRA) . 
As you know, the CRA requires banks  to help meet the credit needs of the 
communit ies they are chartered to serve, including low - and moderate -income 
neighborhoods.  Since its enactment, t he CRA has helped channel capital into 
communities and, in the process, support ed innovative and effective approaches to  
community development.   
We at t he Federal Reserve take our CRA responsibilities seriously.  We evaluate 
the CRA performance of the state -chartered banks we supervise and make the ratings and 
written evaluations public .1  We currently are improving  our e xamination procedures and 
examiner training.  W e also work with our fellow bank regulators to continually  improve 
our implementation of the law.  And, as many of you know, we  recent ly revised our  
interagency guidance to clarify how various community development activities  are 
considered in assessing CRA performance, among them  workforce development , which 
is my topic today .2   
Workforce Development Initiatives  and Challenges  
Workforce development is a bit of a catchall phrase encompassing different types 
of initiatives that help prepare people for jobs by providing them with training, placement

Answers” available at https://www.ffiec.gov/cra/qnadoc.htm .   - 2 - 
assistance, and other support.  O rganizations dedicated to providing workforce 
development are interested not just in helping people secure any jobs, but jobs that pay 
well, provide benefits, offer opportunities for advancement, and are  less likely to be 
eliminated during economic downturns .  Significant job market changes in recent years,  
brought about by global com petition and technological advances --and the new and 
shifting skills that these changes  demand --make workforce development more important 
than ever before.  
As community development practitioners, you know that good -paying, stable j obs 
are not only important to workers and their families , but also are the foundation of strong 
neighborhoods .  As part of our CRA responsibilities, the Federal Reserve, t ogether with 
the Federal Depos it Insurance Corporation and the Office of the C omptroller of the 
Currency , has ma de it clear that banks  will receive CRA recognit ion for lending to, 
investing in, and providing services to workforce development initiatives .  In fact,  two 
Federal Reserve Banks recently publi shed a framew ork describing how  workforce 
development initiatives can fit within a bank’s broader CRA strategy.3 
 While the job  market for the United States as a whole has improved markedly 
since the depths of the financial crisis, the persistently higher unemployment rates in lower -income and minority communities show why workforce development is so 
essential.  F or instance, u nemployment rates averaged 13  percent in low - and moderate-
                                                 
3 See Elizabeth Sobel Blum and Steven Shepelwich (2017), Engaging Workforce Development:  A 
Framework for Meeting CRA Obligations,  Federal Reserve Banks of Dallas and  Kansas City (Dallas:  FRB 
Dallas, January), https://www.dallasfed.org/ -/media/Documents/cd/pubs/workforce.pdf?la=en .   - 3 - 
income communities from 2011 through 2015, compared with  7.3 percent in higher -
income communities.4   
The challenges for workers in minority communities are even greater.   The  
average u nemployment rate across all census tracts where minorities made up a majority 
of the population averaged 14.3 percent from 2011 through 2015.  Also, a much smaller 
share of  the prime working -age population in these areas is employed--67.7 percent 
during this period, which is nearly 9 percentage points lower than in communities with smaller minority populations.
5  These elevated unemployment rates and depressed 
employment- to-population ratios underscore the strong need for  effective workforce 
development options for these  communit ies.  
Education as a Workforce Development Strategy 
Probably the most important workforce development strategy is improving the 
quality of general ed ucation.  The rapid rise in U.S. education levels in the 20th century, 
facilitated by the growing availability of high school education in the first part of the century and the rapid expansion of public universities after World War II, contributed enormous ly to the broad- based economic gains associated with that  period.
6  But , 
unfortunately, for a wide variety of reasons that are beyond the scope of this talk, education levels have historically lagged in low - and moderate -income communities, 
                                                 
4 Low- and moderate -income communities are census tracts with a family median income under 80 percen t 
of the area median income.  Higher -income communities are census tracts with median incomes of 80 
percent of the area median income or greater.  Statistics represent the average of census tract 
unemployment rates rather than the unemployment rate across all individuals in these tracts combined.  
5 Prime -age workers are those who are aged  25 to 54.  Statistics are from the American Community Survey 
(ACS) data releases  from 2011 through 2015, available on the U.S. Census Bureau’s website at 
https://www.census.gov/programs -surveys/acs . 
6 See Claudia Goldin  (2001) , “The Human -Capital Century and American Leadership:  Virtues of the Past, ” 
Journal of Economic History,  vol. 61 (June) , pp. 263-92, https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop -
cambridge -core/content/view/S0022050701028017.   - 4 - 
particularly co mmunities of color.  Between 2011 and 2015, the average proportion of 
adults in low - and moderate -income communities who had dropped out of high school 
was 23.5 percent, which is more than double  the 10.9 percent rate in higher -income 
communities  during that period.7   
 When students  from low - and moderate -income families do complete high 
school, they are less likely to pursue a college degree.  And when they do attend college, 
those students are less likely to graduate.8  Among the reasons for the disparit y are a lack 
of money to pay for college and the burden of family responsibilities .9  As a result, the 
proportion of adults in low - and moderate -income communities from 2011 through 2015 
who had a four -year college degree or graduate degree was about half  the share in higher -
income communities --17.6 percent versus 34 percent.10   
This educational disparity matter s because, among many reasons,  people with less 
education experience both higher unemployment and lower average earnings.  In 
December 2016, for ex ample, the unemployment rate for people age d 25 and older  with a 
bachelor’s or higher degree was only 2.6 percent.  However, the rate was nearly double, 
                                                 
7 Adults are defined here as individuals aged  25 and older .  Statistics are from the ACS data releases  from 
2011 through 2015; see note 5 . 
8 Following a cohort of high  school sophomores in 2002, 96 percent of students from a high 
socioeconomic -status family pursued at least some higher education and 60 percent compl eted a bachelor’s 
degree.  Among students from a low socioeconomic -status family, 72 percent pursued higher education and 
14 percent completed a bachelor’s degree.  Socioeconomic status is based on family income and parents’ 
education.  See National Center  for Education Statistics (2015) , “Postsecondary Attainment:  Differences 
by Socioeconomic Status,” in The Condition of Education 2015 (Washington:  NCES), 
https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/pdf/coe_tva.pdf .  
9 Many people who did not enroll for or did not complete a degree also gave as a reason that they wanted to 
work, which may also reflect budget constraints that made pursuing or completing a higher education 
difficult.  See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2016) , Report on the Economic Well -
Being of U.S . Families in 2015  (Washington:  Board of Governors, May) , 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/2015 -report -economic -well-being -us-households -201605.pdf .

5.1 percent, for workers in this age group with only a high school diploma and about 
triple, 7.9 percent, for those without a high school degree.11   
While high  school graduates earn somewhat more than people who did not finish 
high school, the big payoff comes with a four -year college or advanced degree.12  The 
advantages of higher education, evidenced by lower unemployment rates and higher earnings, are clear across the spectrum but are greater for non -Hispanic whites than for 
African  Americans and Hispanics. 
  
Improving educational  levels in low - and moderate -income communities is a 
long-term task .  At leas t partially  because of  a lack of early childhood education and the 
sometimes lower quality of schools, children in these neighborhoods score substantially lower on standardized tests and drop out of high school at higher rates.
13  Thus, a starting 
point is to improve access to quality education in early childhood and improve the quality of primary and secondary schooling.  
                                                 
11 Moreover, “over 95 percent of jobs created during the recovery have gone to workers with at least some 
college education, while  those with a high school diploma or less are being left behind” (as quoted from  the 
introduction on the webpage  for Anthony P. Carnevale , Tamara Jayasundera, and Artem Gulish  (2016),

for Education and the Workforce), https://cew.georgetown.edu/cew -reports/americas -divided- recovery ).

women with a bachelor’s or higher degree.

We must also recognize and address the barriers faced by low - and moderate -
income students trying to attain higher levels of education --barriers not typically faced by 
their more well- off peers.  First, these students often do not have friends or family who 
have achieved higher educational levels , which matters because students whose parents 
did not attend college are much less likely to pursue a college degree themselves.14  Even 
so, these students can benefit from high school counselors or other mentors who can 
assist them in choos ing schools that provide the financial and counseling support that will 
help them complete their de grees.  And they can benefit from help in picking majors and 
degrees that lead to higher earnings. 15   
Second, lower -income students often pursue their education while working to 
support themselves and family members.  Educational programs that help students 
balance these competing responsibilities go a long way to improving completion rates.  In recognitio n of this fact, the U.S. Department of Education is offering competitive grants 
to postsecondary institutions to support or establish campus -based childcare programs 
primarily serving the needs of low -income students.
16 
I want to reiterate that addressing t he particular barriers standing in the way of 
lower -income students attending college and earning a degree requires a long -term 
                                                 
14 For example, 65 percent of young adults (age d 25 to 34) with a parent who received a bachelor’s degree 
completed one themselves, compared with 16 percent of young adults whose parents completed no 
education beyond high school.  See Board of Governors of t he Federal Reserve System  (2016) , Report on

strategy.  However , not every student wants a two - or four -year degree or will have the 
financial wherewithal to pursue and complete a postsecondary degree.  To  support 
programs aimed at students not bound for college , in 2015, the Federal Reserve Banks of 
Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Atlanta identifie d occupations with  above -average wages 
for workers without a bachelor's degree in the country’s 100 largest metropolitan areas .17  
The Reserve Banks made this information available to workforce development providers 
online and in workshops.  Educational programs and training that lead to better paying 
and more steady work are crucial fo r people without college degrees, particularly lower -
income workers.   
Workforce Development Programs in Action  
In the rest of my remarks, I would like to highlight some examples of successful 
initiatives that illustrate key features of effective workforce  development.18  As you 
know, within our community affairs offices, the Federal Reserve devotes considerable 
effort to studying and promoting effective workforce development, so I am able to draw 
                                                 
17 Top occupations noted across all MSAs  included the following : registered nurses; first -line supervisors 
of office and administrative support workers; sales represen tatives, wholesale and manufacturing ; business 
operations specialists, sales representative services; general and operations managers; computer system 
analysts; automotive service technicians and mechanics; first -line supervisors of construction trades and  
extraction work; plumbers, pipefitters, and steamfitters; first -line supervisors of mechanics, installers ; and 
construction laborers.   See Keith Wardrip, Kyle Fee, Lisa Nelson, and Stuart Andreason, Identifying 
Opportunity Occupations in the Nation’s Largest Metropolitan Economies,  Federal Reserve Banks of 
Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Ohio (Cleveland:  FSB of Cleveland), available at 
https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom -and-events/publications/special- reports/sr -20150909- identifying -
opportunity- occupations.aspx .  
18 For a broad summary of recent research and policy issues related to workforce development, see the 2015 
publication  Transforming U.S. Workforce Development Policies for the 21st Century  (available at 
https://www.kansascityfed.org/publications/community/transform workforce ) developed by the Federal 
Reserve Banks of Atlanta and Kansas City  in partnership with the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce 
Development at Rutgers University .  In addition, all Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors are 
currently engaged i n a System workforce development initiative that will gather up -to-date perspectives 
from employers and organizations engaged i n worker training and education.   This initiative will include a 
series of regional Reserve Bank meetings, a publication on effective investments and outcomes, and a capstone conference in October  in Austin, Texas.    - 8 - 
on the knowledge and experience of our staff.  In discussing the examples, I  woul d like to 
make five points.  
First, it is crucial for younger workers to establish a solid connection to 
employment early in their work lives.  The Federal Reserve’s 2013 Survey of Young 
Workers  found that 18-  to 30-year-olds with early work experience were more likely to  
emerge from the recent recession with a permanent job.19  Other s tudies have  found that 
students who worked 20 hours per week in the ir senior year of high school earned higher 
wages later in life than those wh o did not, and that summer youth employment programs 
improved participants’ attitudes toward their communities, raised their  academic 
aspirations, and boost ed their job readiness skills .20  The findings point to some of the 
reasons that the Boston Fed decid ed to lend technical support to a pilot program  called 
Pocket Change, which aims  to reduce unemployment among low -income 18 - to 24-year-
olds in Somerville, Massachusetts , through internships, training in job skills, and 
reinforcement of important soft skil ls such as  punctuality and effective communication.  
In its  first two years , the initiative  trained 53 low -income young people and placed 20 of 
them in jobs .  The  results  of this modest program  indicate the promise of efforts that 
                                                 
19 The survey found that 82 percent of workers who had worked for pay during high school had a 
permanent job --4 percentage points higher than for all workers combined.  See Board of Governors of the 
Federal Reserve System (2014), In the Shadow of the Great Recession:  Experiences and Perspectives of 
Young Workers  (Washington:  Board of Governors, November), 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/2013 -experiences -and-perspectives -of-young -workers -
201411.pdf . 
20 Baum and Ruhm (2016)  do obser ve, however,  that these gains from employment during the 
senior year of high school have diminished substantially relative to earlier cohorts.  See Charles L. 
Baum and Christopher J. Ruhm (2016 ), “The Changing Benefits of Early Work Experience ,” 
Southern E conomic Journal, vol. 83 (October), pp. 343- 63.  - 9 - 
focus on first -time work experiences , and Somerville is now seeking to expand the 
initiative.21 
My second observation is that c areer and technical education (CTE) programs , 
which have seen a revival in recent years, have considerable potential.  For some time, 
vocational education had fallen out of favor or was in decline in the United States, as it was associated with the deleterious practice of “tracking” less advantaged students that denied them the opportunity for the best education.  But more recently, CTE has been refined and has made a comeback as an effective way to help non -college -bound workers 
gain valuable skills and obtain a foothold in a labor market that increasingly requires technical proficiency.  These programs teach the skills needed to pursue career s in fields  
such as construction, manufacturing, health care, information technology , hospitality, and  
financial services.   
This point brings me to my third observation, which is that effective CTE 
programs and other workforce development initiatives are able to match e ducation and  
training to  good- paying jobs when they actively engage  employers in the training 
process .  WorkAdvance , a regional  sector -specific program , is a good example.  It 
delivers an array of aligned services  to meet local business needs and provide j obs for 
unemployed and low -income adults in multiple cities.
22  An evaluation of the program  
last year  in Tulsa, New York City,  and northeast Ohio found it was especially effective 
                                                 
21 For more information on Pocket Change, see the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s Working Cities 
Challenge webpage at 
https://www.bostonfed.org/workingcities/massachusetts/round1/cities/somerville.html . 
22 Aligned s ervices may include intensive screening, occupational skills t raining, job development and 
placement services, and retention and advancement services .   - 10 - 
because it offered  training for in -demand  skills  and industry -recognized certifications,  
and it focus ed on jobs that have clear paths for advancement.23 
A fourth observation is that apprenticeships, which are more common in other 
countries, could play a larger role for low - and moderate -income individuals in our 
country as part of broader career and technical education efforts.  For instance, a state -run 
program  in South Carolina, Apprenticeship Carolina, helps employers develop 
apprenticeships at no cost to the m.  Business es receive a $1,000 annual tax credi t per 
apprenticeship , and the program  assists them with information and technical needs, 
paperwork, and the integrat ion of  classroom learning at local technical colleges .  The 
program has led to sizable job gains at  a modest cost to  the state.24  Similarly,  
Washington State r egistered a pprenticeship program s contributed to substantial long -term 
increases  in employment rates and hourly wage s.25  
My fifth and final observation is that promoting entrepreneurship could play a 
greater role in workforce development .  Entrepreneurship is a fundamental strength of the 
American economy, and owning your own business or working for yourself can offer 
income, a means of building wealth, and, sometimes, greater flexibility for balancing job and family commitments .  Yet we see less self -employment in low - and moderate -income

to have paid employees .27  These findings speak to the opportunities that could be 
realized by helping people start t heir own businesses and then helping them grow their 
businesses.  Programs that equip people with the management skills and knowledge they 
need to start and operate a successful small business  can help.  R elevant and effective 
training can reduce the failure rate of businesses by helping owners make better decisions  
and avoid costly mistakes.28  These programs are especially critical i n low -income and 
rural communities where other resources  to support small business development may be 
scarce. 
As part of their community affairs work, several Federal Reserve Banks have 
small business development initiatives.  T he Federal Reserve Bank of New York 
organized a s mall business protection and  education s eries last ye ar in partnership with 
the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce and a local d evelopment c orporation.  Participants 
learned about capital resources available to small businesses, online credit alternatives for small businesses, and the risks of handling large volum es of cash.   In another example, 
the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City developed a  guide to help rural and smaller 
                                                 
26 From 2011 through  2015, only 8 percent of households in low - and moderate- income communities 
reported self -employment income, compared with 11 percent of all households  (see ACS data releases in 
note 5).  
27 Only 4 percent of African American -owned firms and 9 percent of Hispanic -owned firms have paid 
employees, compared with 22 percent of non -minority -owned firms; see U.S. Department of Commerce,

metropolitan communities promote conditions favorable to grow ing local businesses  
rather than relying only on efforts to attract large companies.29   
Of course, in addition to training, small business owners need financing .  But, as 
many of you know, factors such as lack of a credit history or a poor  credit history  and 
limited collateral--for example,  home equity --make it difficult for the own ers of small 
enterprises  to access traditional business credit .  This situation is true for many  minority, 
women, and low -income borrowers.30  Nontraditional  lenders , including more than 1,000 
Community Development Financial Institutions  around the country, help fill the gap.31   
Conclusion  
To conclude, while the economy overall is recovering and the job market has 
improved substantially since the recession, pockets of persistently high unemployment, as 
well as other challenges, remain.  F ortunately, programs such as the ones I  have 
highlighted today can help address these challenges in more targeted ways than the Federal Reserve is equipped to do through monetary policy.  I want you to know that we applaud your work, and we thank you for doing all that you do to serve the needs of 
lower -income communities across the country.  Whether you work to provide affordable 
housing, homeownership counseling, small business credit and technical support, or workforce development, I hope you know that y ou have a partner in the Federal Reserve.  
In the ways we can, with the different tools we each have, our aim is the same:  to make

Thank you, and I also would like to thank the organizers of this forum for 
arrang ing for me to be part of your conversation, on a day when other business 
unfortunately prevents me from travelling to Kansas City.   
And I am really looking forward to hearing from all of you on what I expect will 
be a range of topics, but I thought I might start with a few remarks about something of  
considerable interest to me, which is diversity and inclusion. 
I think the Kansas City Fed is an excellent place to discuss this issue because of 
the recognition it has received for promoting diversity and inclusion, both among 
businesses and other organizations in the 10th District and in its own ranks.  I know that the Bank is continuing to hold Diversity Summits with firms a nd community groups, the 
most recent of which was last month.  In various ways, it is also promoting diversity among its own staff and senior leaders through recruiting, hiring and promotions, and is 
closely tracking progress.  The Greater Kansas City Cham ber of Commerce singled out 
the Bank this year for its diversity efforts from among 20 organizations and businesses. 
I believe these efforts reflect a commitment to diversity that is found throughout 
the Federal Reserve System, and I  woul d like to talk a b it about the basis for that 
commitment, starting with why it is that diversity, in its different forms, is so important.   
One r eason that the Fed organizes conferences such as this one is to facilitate 
communication.  In this case, we want to communicate with you, as leaders of institutions we oversee and are otherwise affected by our decisions.  We want to understand your views and try to explain what we are trying to accomplish.  Such communication would not be effective if only one or just a few banks i n the 10th District were part of the 
conversation.  Today’s forum includes bankers from smaller community banks , regional  - 2 - 
banks , and large banks because the roles of your institutions in your communities differ, 
and hearing your different views provides a fuller picture of the industry’s views.  
Similarly, it is important to include in the conversation bankers of diverse backgrounds, which is why it is important that we hear from minority bankers.  
In these examples, diversity in its various  forms is a sourc e of strength, which  is 
something that we as financial regulators understand very well.  The Federal Reserve 
supports an ongoing role for community banks in part because diversity among financial institutions promotes a stable and healthy financial system,  spurring competition and 
ensuring that customers of all types have access to a wide variety of services.  The Federal Reserve supports the Partnership for Progress, which assists and advises minority -owned financial institutions, because we believe that t hose institutions  are 
likewise a source of diversity that contributes to a healthy financial system.  
I expect it is not news, either, to bankers, that diversity is a source of strength.  
Every day, in serving customers, bankers can see the strength that comes from diversity --
the wisdom of diversification in investment decisions, in diverse product lines for the businesses  you lend to, and especially in the strength of diverse communities.    
Diversity also strengthens organizations by making it possible to have a wide 
variety of views available.  It helps ensure that individuals within those organizations have the opportunity to shine and employ their talents to the fullest and that their best ideas are heard and acted on.  The banks you serve are better abl e to reach new 
customers, especially groups of customers who have historically been underbanked, when they show that serving those customers is a top priority.  And one of the most effective ways of showing a commitment to a diverse customer base is showin g a commitment to a  - 3 - 
diverse workforce.  Demographic trends indicate that minorities will be an increasing 
share of the population in the years and decades ahead, and thus an increasing share of new customers for your institutions.  
My organization, the Fede ral Reserve, is also committed  to a diverse workforce 
and to diversity in our senior leadership.  T he Federal Reserve is pursuing  this goal  not 
only for all of the practical reasons I  have cited to seek diversity , but also because it is the 
right thing to do.  I want to be clear to all of you that I am committed to  improving 
diversity throughout our organization, including at the upper ranks.  Diversity is also important on the boards of directors and advisory councils of Reserve Banks.  I hope, in fact, th at in this room today there are individuals who one day may serve as a n advisor, 
director or even a Reserve Bank President or member of the Board of Governors.  
Improving diversity requires effort and constant focus.  We will continue working 
hard to achiev e this goal.  I believe it is as vital to the Federal Reserve as it is to your 
employers, and to every employer, to improve diversity and extend opportunity to everyone.

I’m very pleased to participate in this conference honoring my good friend 
Mervyn King.  As Mervyn noted in a recent speech in New York, we had adjoining 
offices at MIT as young academics and never imagined that 30 years later we still would be colleagues --as central bankers.
1  Now, as then, I value his advice and insight.  
The topic of this session is lessons learned from the financial crisis.  For me, 
perhaps the central insight is that the recent crisis, despite its many exotic features, was in 
fact a classic financial panic--a systemwide run of “hot money ” away from assets whose 
values suddenly became uncertain.  In that respect, the crisis was akin to many other 
financial crises faced by governments and central banks --including that most venerable of 
central banks, the Bank of England--over the centuries.  The response to the crisis likewise followed the classic prescriptions of liquidity provision, liability guar antees, 
asset evaluation and disposition, and recapitalization where necessary.  Although the crisis had classic features, to a significant extent it took place in a novel institutional context , making diagnosis and response more challenging :  For example,  in the United 
States,  collateralized  wholesale funding rather than conventional bank deposits 
constituted the hot money, and run pressure was experienced not only by banks but by 
diverse other institutions, such as structured investment vehicles.  In addi tion, the scale 
and complexity of globalized financial institutions and markets made it difficult to predict how the crisis might spread  or to coordinate the response .  One of the few positive 
aspects of th is episode  was the extraordinary degree of international cooperation achieved 
among  policymakers, including the Bank of Engla nd and the Federal Reserve, in 
responding to the crisis .

Because I have developed these themes in some detail elsewhere, I thought today 
I would tackle a different and more recent i ssue that has arisen in the aftermath of the 
crisis --the issue of whether , in the widespread easing of monetary policies, we are seeing 
a competitive depreciation of exchange rates .2  Like other aspects of the crisis, the notion 
of competitive depreciation  has strong classical antecedents , particularly in relation to  the 
global Great Depression of the 1930s.  So let me start by briefly revisiting  the older 
discussion and its evolution. 
As my audience knows, on the eve of the Great Depression the exchange ra tes of 
most industrial countries were determined by the rules of the international gold standard--
or, more technically, by the gold- exchange standard, as foreign exchange (primarily 
dollars and pounds sterling) was used along with gold as a form of interna tional reserves.  
The gold standard, which had been suspended during World War I, was painstakingly rebuilt in the 1920s.  Unfortunately, the reconstructed gold standard had a number of serious problems.  For one, the exchange rates implied by the gold val uations that 
countries chose for their currencies following World War I were in some cases far from the levels consistent with balanced flows in trade and payments.  Notably, as John Maynard Keynes pointed out in his famous pamphlet , The Economic Consequences of 
Mr. Churchill , the British pound was overvalued under the new gold standard, which 
disadvantaged British exports and contributed to weak economic conditions in the United 
                                                 
2 See, for example, Ben S. Bernanke (2009), “Reflections on a Y ear of Crisis,” speech delivered at 
“Financial Stability and Macroeconomic Policy,” a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Kansas City , held in  Jackson Hole, Wyo ., August 20 -22,

Kingdom in the late  1920s.3  One of Mervyn King’s predecessors as governor of the 
Bank of England, Montagu Norman, who presided over both Britain’s return to the gold 
standard and its subsequent exit, said of the ill -fated choice of parity for the pound:  
“Only God could tell whether it [the value in gold chosen for the pound sterli ng] was or 
was not the correct figure”; another  commentator added, “But of course the Deity may 
not be an Economist.”4  
Another problem, which became clear as the global economy weakened and 
financial conditions deteriorated, was that fixed exchange rates under the gold standard 
were vulnerable to speculative runs.  Although runs, or in some cases policy decisions, effectively took a number of countries off the gold standard in the early 1930s , the 
financial world was shaken to its foundation when the Unite d Kingdom, the unofficial 
center of the global gold standard, was forced by a speculative attack to leave gold in September 1931.  Over the next five years, essentially all of the world’s industrial nations left the gold standard, either de facto or de jur e.  Declines in the value of the departing 
nation’s currency, sometimes very sharp ones, typically followed.  
The uncoordinated abandonment of the gold standard in the early 1930s gave rise 
to the idea of “beggar -thy-neighbor ” policies.  According to this a nalysis, as put forth by 
important contemporary economists like Joan Robinson, exchange rate depreciations 
helped the economy whose currency had weakened by making the country more competitive internationally.
5  Indeed, the decline in the value of the pound after 1931 was

associated with a relatively early recovery from the Depression by the United Kingdom , 
in part because of some rebound in  exports.  However, according to this view, the gains 
to the depreciatin g country were equaled or exceeded by the losses to its trading partners, 
which became less internationally competitive --hence, “beggar thy neighbor.”  Over 
time, so -called competitive depreciations became associated in the minds of historians 
with the tar iff wars that followed the passage of the Smoot -Hawley tariff in the United 
States.  Both types of policies were decried --and in some textbooks, still are --as having 
prolonged the Depression by disrupting trade patterns while leading to an ultimately 
fruitless and destructive battle over shrinking international markets.  
Economists still agree that Smoot- Hawley and the ensuing tariff wars were highly 
counterproductive and contributed to the depth and length of the global Depression.  However, modern research on the Depression, beginning with the seminal 1985 paper by Barry Eichengreen and Jeffrey Sachs, has changed our view of the effects of the 
abandonment of the gold standard.
6  Although it is true that leaving the gold standard and 
the resulting currency depreciation conferred a temporary competitive advantage in some cases, modern research shows that the primary benefit of leaving gold was that it freed countries to use appropriately expansionary monetary policies.  By 1935 or 1936, when essentially all ma jor countries had left the gold standard and exchange rates were market -
determined, the net trade effects of the changes in currency values were certainly small.  
Yet the global economy as a whole was much stronger than it had been in 1931.  The 
reason was  that, in shedding the strait jacket of the gold standard, each country became 
free to use monetary policy in a way that was more commensurate with achieving full 
                                                 
6 See Barry Eichengreen  and Jeffrey Sachs (1985),  “Exchange Rates and Economic Recovery in the 
1930s, ” Journal of Economic History , vol. 45  (December ), pp. 925-46.  - 5 - 
employment at home.  Moreover, and critically, countries also benefited from stronger 
growth in trading partners that purchased their exports.  In sharp contrast to the tariff 
wars, monetary reflation in the 1930s was a positive -sum exercise, whose benefits came 
mainly from higher domestic demand in all countries , not from  trade diversion arising 
from  changes  in exchange rates.  
The lessons for  the present are clear.  Today most advanced industrial economies 
remain, to varying extents, in the grip of slow recoveries from the Great Recession.  W ith 
inflation generally contained, central banks in thes e countries are providing 
accommodative monetary policies to support growth.  Do these policies constitute competitive devalu ations?  To the contrary, because mone tary policy is accommodative 
in the great majority of advanced industrial economies, one woul d not expect large and 
persistent changes in the configuration of exchange rates among these countries.  The benefits of monetary accommodation in the advanced economies are not created in any 
significant way by changes in exchange rates; they  come instead  from the support for 
domestic aggregate demand in each country or region.  Moreover, because stronger growth in each economy confers beneficial spillovers to trading partners, these policies are not “beggar -thy-neighbor” but rather are positive -sum, “enri ch-thy-neighbor” actions.  
Again, the distinction between monetary policies aimed at domestic objectives 
and trade -diverting exchange  rate devaluations or other protectionist measures is critical.  
The former can be mutually beneficial, the latter are not.  Indeed, it was this view that 
prompted the Group of Seven central bankers and finance ministers to issue a statement in February agreeing to refrain from actions focused on achieving competitive advantage  - 6 - 
by weakening their currencies and reaffirming that  fiscal and monetary policies would 
remain oriented toward meeting domestic objectives using domestic instruments.7   
Among the advanced economies, the mutual benefits of monetary easing are 
clear.  The case of emerging market economies is more complicated .  To a first 
approximation, industrial countries are most concerned that domestic aggregate demand 
be set at the level that best fosters price stability and a return to full employment at home .  
In contrast, many emerging market economies may be concerned  not only with the level 
of domestic demand (as needed to achieve objectives for employment and inflation) but with other considerations as well.  First, because in recent decades many of these countries have pursue d an export -led strategy for industrializ ation, they may be leery of 
expansionary policies in the advanced economies that, all else being equal, tend to cause the currencies of emerging market economies to appreciate, restraining their exports .  
Second, because many emerging market economies have  financial sectors that are small  
or less developed by global standards but open to foreign investors, they may perceive themselves to be vulnerable to asset bubbles and financial imbalances caused by heavy and volatile capital inflows, including those ari sing from low interest rates in the 
advanced economies.  
I agree these challenges are significant.  However, a few points should be made.  
Regarding the effects of monetary  easing on exchange rates and exports,  I would note 
that trade -weighted real exchange rates of emerging market economies, with some 
exceptions, have not changed much from their values shortly before the intensification of the financial crisis in late 2008.  Moreover, even if the expansionary policies of the

advanced economies were to lead to significant currency appreciation in emerging 
markets, the resulting drag on their competitiveness would have to be balanced against the positive effects of stronger advanced -economy demand.  Which of these two effects 
would be greater is an empirical matter.  Simulations of the Federal Reserve Board’s econometric models of the global economy suggest that the effects are roughly offsetting, so that accommodative monetary policies in the advanced economies do not appear, on 
net, to have adverse consequences for output and exports in the emerging market economies.
8  A return to solid growth among the advanced economies is ultimately in the 
interest of advanced and emerging market economies alike.  
Regarding capit al flows:  It is true that interest rate differentials associated with 
differences in national monetary policies can promote cross -border capital flows  as 
investors seek higher returns .  But my reading of recent research makes me skeptical that 
these polic y differences are the dominant force behind capital flows to emerging market 
economies; differences in growth prospects  across countries  and swings in investor risk 
sentiment seem to have played a larger role.9  Moreover, the fact that some emerging 
market  economies have policies that depress the values of their currencies may create an 
expectation of future appreciation that in and of itself induces speculative inflows. 
                                                 
8 Other work  also supports the finding of no adverse spillovers.  For example, one that finds strong positive 
spillovers is  Bennett T. McCallum (20 03), “Japanese Monetary Policy, 1991- 2001, ” Federal Reserve Bank 
of Richmond,  Economic Quarterly , vol. 89 (Winter ), pp. 1-31, 
www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_quarterly/2003/winter/pdf/mccallum.pdf .   
9 For example, Fratzscher , Lo Duca, and Straub find that factors other than U.S. monetary policy have been 
substantially more important as drivers of capital flows to emerging market economies ; see Marcel 
Fratzscher, Marco Lo Duca, and Roland Straub  (2012 ), “A Global Monetary Tsun ami?   On the Spillovers 
of US Quantitative Easing,” Centr e for Economic Policy and Research, Discussion Paper Number 9195 
(London:  CEPR, October),  www.cepr.org/pubs/dps/DP9195.asp.  See also Atish R. Ghosh, Jun Kim, 
Mahvash S. Qureshi, and Juan Zalduendo  (2012) , “Surges,” IMF Working Paper WP/12/22 (Washington:

Manag ing Capital Inflow --Cross -Cutting Themes and Possible Policy Framework ,” paper (Washington:  
IMF, February), www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2011/021411a.pdf .   
  - 8 - 
Of course, heavy capital inflows and their volatility pose challenges to emerging  
market policymakers, whatever their source.  Policymakers do have some tools to address 
these concerns.  In recent years, emerging  market nations have implemented 
macroprudential measures aimed at strengthening their financial systems and reducing overheat ing in specific sectors, such as property markets.  Policymakers have also 
experimented with various forms of capital controls.  Such controls raise concerns about effectiveness, cost of implementation, and possible microeconomic distortions.  Nevertheless , the International Monetary Fund has suggested that, in carefully 
circumscribed circumstances, capital controls may be a useful tool.
10 
In sum, the advanced industrial economies are currently pursuing appropriately 
expansionary policies to help support rec overy and price stability in their own countries.  
As the modern literature on the Great Depression demonstrates, these policies confer net benefits on the world economy as a whole and should not be confused with zero- or 
negative -sum policies of trade diversion.  In fact, the simultaneous use by several 
countries of accommodative policy can be mutually reinforcing to the benefit of all.  
Let me end these remarks as I began , by paying tribute to Mervyn  King .  He has 
been a leader in the central banking comm unity during an extraordinarily difficult period.  
I wish him the very best in the next stage of his career.  
                                                 
10 Importantly, such circumstances exclude the use of capital controls to avoid other necessary 
macroeconomic policy adjustments, such as greater exchange rate flexibility.   See, for example,

Institutional View ,” (Washington:  International Monetary Fund).  ",2013-03-25,bernanke

 Good evening.  Thank you for the invitation to speak at the Carroll Round this 
year.1  
Economics, like any other discipline, has its own established  canon and set of 
rules and models.  But it is also constantly evolving, growing, and changing shape.  New 
approaches and methods are developed.  Unique forces arise and long-established 
behaviors can change —as we have seen over the past three years, and even the past 
decade.  There will always be unasked questions and new trails to blaze.  And, as in any 
field, the people who make up the profession lie at the heart of its  growth and progress.  
It is a pleasure to be here today among  such a talented group of future economists.  
Your research reflects everything that is exciting about the discipline.  Because you have 
interesting theses.  Because you have used an impressive v ariety of data sets and models.  
And because you have a perspective that is unique to your generation and experiences.  
As you know, I was a professor of economics and international relations at 
Michigan State University  for nearly two decades before joinin g the Board of Governors.  
Among my favorite courses to teach were undergraduate  research courses.  It was 
magical to see the novel ways that  students brought new ideas, literature, models, 
methods, and data to the most pressing problems of the day.  I see some of that magic in 
the research represented here this evening . 
In keeping with that spirit of inquiry, I would like to talk today about some of the 
open questions I see for understanding  the economic outlook and for setting monetary 
policy.  I will als o focus on some of the data sources I find valuable for answering those 
questions.   
 
1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open 
Market Committee.

Inflation  
For monetary policy, the foremost questions currently are about the inflation 
process.   The pandemic -related economic shutdown created rapid shifts in demand, 
which continued through the reopening process and reflected people’s wants and needs 
during that time.  For instance, there was a sharp move away from in -person services and 
toward goods.  This was coupled with disruptions to supply, both in global supply cha ins 
and the labor force.  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year further restricted access to 
commodities, and the subsequent surge in energy prices drove a spike in consumer price 
inflation to a peak in mid -2022, reaching levels not seen since the 1980s.  
As energy prices have moderated and supply disruptions have eas ed, inflation has 
followed suit and started to abate.  Last week, data on the consumer price index (CPI) 
showed 12 -month inflation falling  to 5 percent in March from a peak of about 9  percent 
last June.  The Fed has a  preferred consumer price measure , which  is the personal 
consumption expenditures (PCE) price index .  It covers a broader set of goods and 
services  than the CPI , and its weighting of individual prices can change each month to 
reflect consumer spending behavior.  Last week’s data suggest that PCE inflation likely 
will be somewhat above 4 percent in March, also significantly lower than last June.  The 
big question,  however, is whether, and how quickly, inflation will continue its downward 
path toward our target of 2 percent.  Much of the decline so far has been driven by the 
moderation in energy prices, and there is evidence that the path back to our low and 
stable inflation goal could be long and is  likely to be uneven and bumpy.  
Total (or headline) inflation tells us something critical about the effect  on our 
daily lives —simply put , people  need to eat, pay their bills, and get to work and school,  
 - 3 - 
among other things , and their budgets feel the impact.   We also look at core inflation, 
which omits volatile food and energy prices and tends to give a more accurate signal of 
total inflation ’s trajectory.   The rise and fall in core measures has been less dramatic than 
that of total inflation.  We also look at other measures of underlying inflation, that try to 
get at the central tendency of inflation, such as median or trimmed -mean inflation.  All of 
these measures have come off their peaks but remain elevated, suggesting t hat inflation 
has become broad  based in the economy.  
Of course, economic data are generally backward looking.  One question is 
whether timely data can give us a sense of where inflation is going.  To this end, I have 
found several useful sources of data.  For instance, t o forecast core goods prices —which 
drove much of the initial surge in inflation —I look at various measures of supply chain 
disruptions and input prices.  Those indicators helped predict the moderation in goods 
prices that emerged last fall.  For automobiles, where shortages of semiconductors held 
down production and drove up prices for both new and used cars, I looked at wholesale 
used car prices as a leading indicator of retail prices.  Those wholesale prices declined 
last fall but have turn ed up recently, suggesting that the moderation in goods prices may 
not be a smooth process.  
A big contributor to inflation over the past two years has been housing services 
prices (rent and a measure called owners’ equivalent rent —essentially what a homeow ner 
would pay if they had to rent their home).  To help forecast this component , I have 
looked at rent increases on new leases , which slowed sharply over the past six months , as 
a leading indicator.  These data come from sources that might be familiar to y ou, like 
Zillow, Apartments.com, and Apartment  List.  One encouraging development is that last  
 - 4 - 
week’s CPI data showed a significant slowing in housing services inflation.  This 
development likely reflects moderation in demand and has been helped by the add itional  
supply of multifamily housing that is being completed.  More places available to lease 
should contribute to easing rental prices.  
Finally, in forecasting inflation, especially for the broader category of core 
services ex. housing, a looming questi on is how the relationship between inflation and 
measures of economic slack —including  in the labor market —will play out.  This 
relationship has been challenged in recent years , particularly in terms of trying to explain 
the large movements in inflation sin ce the pandemic.  
Labor Markets  
The labor market poses its own set of questions .  To what extent has the labor 
market recovered from the 2020 downturn, and in what ways will it continue to differ 
from its pre -pandemic structure?  With a range of data to consult , which indicators best 
capture the state of the jobs market?  
By many measure s, the U .S. labor market is very strong.  Payroll employment 
growth was robust in the first three months of this year, unemployment is near record 
lows, and job openings remain very high.  A critical component of the labor market’s 
fortitude is that it has  extended its benefits to historically disadvantaged groups —those 
who have persistently seen gaps with their counterparts in other demographics, especially 
along racial lines.  The African American unemployment rate historically has been about 
4 to 5 perce ntage points above the overall unemployment rate, but that gap was cut in 
about half in 2019, following years of sustained expansion.  After widening during the  
 - 5 - 
pandemic, that gap has once again narrowed, this time more quickly, and African 
American unempl oyment was at a record low of 5.0 percent in March.   
Similarly, w orkers in the lowest -income quartile have seen the strongest wage 
growth  relative to other quartiles  over the past two years .  Those  workers  have benefitted 
from the availability of jobs and , in many cases, the ability to move to better, higher -
paying jobs in the current strong labor market.  
Nonetheless, there are some signs that this strong labor market is softening at the 
margin.  Wage growth has moderated somewhat from the rates reached ab out a year ago.  
Indicators of hiring have slowed.  Job openings , while still elevated, have declined in 
recent months.  And the quits rate has retraced more than half of its pandemic -era rise, 
falling from a 3  percent peak in late 2021 to 2.6 percent in F ebruary.  That could be 
significant, as much of the surge in wage growth a year ago may have been driven by 
outsized wage gains of those changing jobs and by employers raising wages to retain 
existing workers.  
Supply  
The wage moderation may partly reflect some improvement in labor supply.  One 
factor is that new estimates show higher population growth over the past year amid a 
rebound in immigration  from its reduced levels during  the pandemic.  Labor force 
participation also has edged up to 62.5 percent in the most recent data.  Prime -age 
participation (for workers age d 25 to 54) is now back to pre -pandemic levels.  In our 
series of Fed Listens  events in 2019 , when we talked with a wide range of people and 
community organizations, we heard that a strong labo r market can pull in people  from the  
 - 6 - 
sidelines who have skills that can be developed if given a chance .  That appears to be 
happening now.   
The Fed cannot directly act to increase supply in the economy, but supply is a key 
input to our economic outlook.  One important source of increased supply is productivity 
growth, which comes through both capital investment and innovation.  My hope is that 
we will see increased innovation and productivity associated with the spurt of new 
businesses that have opened sin ce the onset of the pandemic.   
Supply -side issues , especially innovation and productivity , have been a theme of 
my own academic research , including papers on patents and on the growth and funding of 
small businesses.  So I am so pleased to see many of your topics touching on these issues, 
often using novel data sets from a wide range of countries.  
International  
International issues are also an important  area of research —and open questions —
and have bee n another theme of my career.   Much of the recent inf lation episode was tied 
to international factors , including  global supply chain  disruptions  and the surge in 
commodity prices.   The continued war in Ukraine, China’s economic reopening, and 
OPEC+ decisions on oil supply are some of the international forces  that could affect the 
U.S. economy this year.  
We can also learn a lot from comparisons across economies with different 
economic structures and different policy responses to global shocks such as COVID.   The 
importance of watching and learning from  foreign  economies  has also been a  central 
tenet  of my career  in economics.  Economic forces and reverberations cannot be 
contained within regional or national borders.  Even a giant  like the U .S. economy does  
 - 7 - 
not operate alone.  One of my top 10 pieces of advice for future economists is to study 
foreign economies (and languages, if you have the opportunity).  
I wrote my dissertation on the Russian banking system.   It certainly taught me a 
lot about Russia and its economy specifically, and, given that I was there during the post -
Soviet transition, it was an immersive  experience of change.   What I saw in Russia taught 
me that you could apply the same playbook that had seen near-uniform success but see it 
fail when the necessary foundation was lacking.  In this case, the banking  system model 
that worked here could not take hold in post -Soviet Russia, because it was missing trust 
and universal faith in the rule of law , which are critical to the functioning of financial 
institutions in market economies .  A major lesson f or me was that models help clarify our 
thinking, but any particular model is  not always relevant for the given time, situation , or 
context.  
That experience was also possibly the best research training in the world.  It is one 
thing to do your dissertation without  the internet —it is another level to manually make 
your way through the records of the Kremlin’s statistical agency !  
I will finish t he “research abroad hard  sell” by noting that nothing gives you quite 
the same clarity and perspective on a situation  as seeing it through someone else’s eyes.  
Immersing yourself in a new culture is reward in and of itself, but it will also teach you as 
much about your own world as it does about that of others.  
Monetary Policy  
Stepping back into the United States in 2023, what does the state of the economy 
mean for monetary policy?  Relevant questions  include , what are the channels through  
 - 8 - 
which policy ti ghtening affects the economy?  And what are the lags before the full 
effects are felt on the economy and on inflation?  
Since my first Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) meeting last June, my 
approach has been one of data dependen ce.  It has also taken in to account  risk 
management , which concedes that the Federal Reserve cannot eliminate risks but can 
manage  them.  This data -dependent, risk -management framework has led me to support 
the F OMC ’s response of rapid  monetary  policy tightening —we have raised int erest rates 
475 basis points in a year to bring inflation under control.   Currently, with the federal 
funds rate target near 5 percent, I am looking at what rate will be sufficiently restrictive 
to bring inflation down to 2  percent, over time.   
I am weighi ng the implications of stronger momentum in the economy apparent in 
economic indicators over the past few months against potential headwinds from recent 
banking developments.  If tighter financing conditions are a significant headwind on the 
economy, the a ppropriate path of the federal funds rate may be lower than it would be in 
their absence.  But if data show continued strength in the economy and slower 
disinflation, we may have more work to do.  
In setting monetary policy, I continue to be guided by  our d ual-mandate goals of 
maximum employment and price stability.  I, like my colleagues on the FOMC,  am 
committed  to bring ing inflation back to its 2 percent target over time, which will lay the 
foundation for sustainable strength in the labor market and the U .S. economy.   
Thank  you. ",2023-04-21,cook

July 10, 20 13 
  
I’d like to thank the National Bureau of Economic Research for organizing this 
conference in recognition of the Federal Reserve’s centennial , and I’m glad to have the 
opportunity to participate .  In keeping with the spirit of the conference, my remarks today 
will take  a historical perspective.  I will leave discussion of current policy to today’s 
question -and-answer  session and, of course, to my c ongressional testimony next week.  
  Today , I’ll discuss the evolution over the past 100 years of three key aspects of 
Federa l Reserve policymaking:  the goals of policy, the policy framework, and 
accountability and communication.  The changes over time in these three areas provide a 
useful perspective, I believe, on how the role and functioning of the Federal Reserve have 
chang ed since its founding in 1913, as well as some lessons for the present and  for the 
future.  I will pay particular attention to several key episodes of the Fed’s history, all of 
which have been referred to in various contexts with the adjective “Great” attached to 
them:   the Great Experiment of the Federal Reserve’s founding , the Great Depression , the 
Great Inflation and  subsequent d isinflation , the Great Moderation , and the recent Great 
Recession.  
The Great Experiment  
In the words of one of the authors of the Federal Reserve Act, Robert Latham 
Owen, t he Federal Reserve was establ ished  to “provide a means by which periodic panics 
which shake the American Republic and do it enormous injury shall be stopped. ”1  In 
short, the original goal of the Great Experiment that was the founding of the Fed was the 
                                                 
1 See Owen (1919, p. 24 ).  The Treasury carried out some central banking functions before the creation of 
the Federal Reserve.  In addition, the United States had experimented with central banking before, with the 
First and Second Banks of the United States.   By 1913, however, it had been about 75 years since the latter 
institution had ceased fulfilling that purpose.  Moreover, the Federal Reserve operated somewhat 
differently from the prior institutions, and, in that respect, its creation amounted to an expe riment.   - 2 - 
preservation of financial stabi lity.2  At the time, the standard view of panics was that they 
were triggered when the needs of business and agriculture for liquid funds outstripped the 
available supply --as when seasonal plantings or shipments of crops had to be financed, 
for example --and that panics were further exacerbated by the incentives of banks and 
private individuals to hoard liquidity during such times .3  The new institution was 
intended to relieve such  strains  by providing  an “elastic” currency --that is, by providing  
liquidity  as needed  to individual member banks through the  discount window ; 
commercial banks, in turn, would then be able to accommodate their customers.  
Interestingly, although congressional advocates hoped the creation of the Fed would help 
prevent future panics, they did not fully embrace the idea that the Fed should help end 
ongoing panics by serving as lender of last resort, as had been recommended by the 
British economist and writer Walter Bagehot .4  Legislators imposed  limits on the Federal 
Reserve’s ability t o lend in response to panics , for example,  by denying nonmember 
banks access to the discount window and by restricting the type s of collateral that the Fed 
could accept .5 
The framework that the Federal Reserve employed in its early years to promote 
financial stability  reflected in large measure the influence of  the so-called  real bills 
                                                 
2 Per a review of the 1929 book Wall Street and Washington  in the New York Times , “The Federal Reserve 
System has from the first necessarily been a great experiment, bound to adjust its general policies to the 
requirements of such novel and varying  situations as should arise in the course of our financial history and 
which could not possibly be foreseen”  (Noyes, 1929) .  
3 Friedman and Schwartz (1963) describe the debate about the elastic currency.  Warburg (1914 ) discusses 
hoarding and the panic dyn amics that the  Federal Reserve was established to prevent.  
4 See Willis (1923, p. 1407 ), Carlson and Wheelock (2012), and Bordo and Wheelock (2013).  Bagehot 
([1873 ] 1897 ) is the source of the classic dictum that a panic should be addressed by the central bank, by 
lending freely at a penalty rate.  
5 The Monetary Control Act of 1980 gave all depository institutions access to the discount window.  The 
collateral acceptable to be pledged to the discount window has been expanded significantly over time; in 
particular, various pieces of banking legislation in the early 1930s enabled the Federal Reserve to make 
advances to member banks so long as the loans were “secured to the satisfaction” of the Federal Reserve 
Bank extending the loan.   - 3 - 
doctrine , as well as the fact that the United States was on the gold standard.6  In the 
framework of the real bills doctrine , the Federal Reserve saw its function  as meeting the 
needs of business for liquidity --consistent  with the idea of providing an elastic currency --
with the ultimate goal of supporting financial and economic stability.7  When business 
activity was increasing, the  Federal Reserve helped accommodate th e need for credit by  
supplying liquidity to banks; w hen business was contracting  and less credit  was needed , 
the Fed reduced the liquidity in the system . 
As I mentioned, the Federal Reserve pursued this approach to policy in the 
context of the gold standar d.  Federal Reserve notes were redeemable in gold on demand , 
and the  Fed was required  to maintain a gold reserve equal to 40 percent of outstanding 
notes.  However, contrary to the principles of an idealized gold standard, the Federal 
Reserve often took ac tions to prevent inflows and outflows of gold from being fully 
translated into changes in the domestic money supply.8  This practice, together with the 
size of the U.S. economy, gave the Federal Reserve considerable autonomy in monetary 
policy and, in part icular, allowed the Fed to conduct policy according to the real bills 
doctrine without much hindrance.  
The policy framework of the Fed’s early years has been much criticized in 
retrospect.  Although the gold standard did not appear to have greatly constrai ned U.S. 
monetary policy in the years after the Fed’s founding, subsequent research has 
highlighted  the extent to which the international gold standard served to destabilize the 
                                                 
6 See Humphrey (1982) for  a discussion of the historical evolution of the real bills doctrine.  
7 This interpretation follow s from the discussion in the Tenth Annual Report of the Federal Reserve Board  
(Board of Governors, 1924).  Soon after the  Federal Reserve was founded, its mission shifted to supporting 
the war effort and then to managing the unwinding of that support.  The year 1923 was thus one of the first 
in which the  Federal Reserve confronted normal peacetime financial conditions, and it took the opport unity 
to articulate  its views on the appropriate condu ct of policy in such conditions.

market operations, discussed later.   - 4 - 
global economy in the late 1920s and early 1930s.9  Likewise, economic histori ans have 
pointed out that, under the real bills doctrine, the Fed increased the money supply 
precisely at those times at which business activity and upward pressures on prices were 
strongest; that is, monetary policy was procyclical.  Thus, the Fed’s actio ns tended to 
increase rather than decrease the volatility in economic activity and prices.10   
During this early period , the new central bank did make an important addition to 
its menu of policy tools.  Initially, the Fed’s main tools were the quantity of i ts lending 
through the discount window and the interest rate at which it lent, the discount rat e.  
Early on, however, to generate earnings to finance  its operations, the  Federal Reserve 
began purchasing government securities in the open market --what came t o be known as 
open market operations.  In the early 1920s, Fed officials discovered  that these operations 
affected the supply and cost of bank reserves and, consequently, the terms on which 
banks extended credit to their customers.   Subsequently,  of course , open market 
operations became a principal monetary policy tool, one that allowed the Fed to interact 
with the broader financial markets, not only with banks .11   
I’ve discussed the original mandate and early policy framework of the Fed.  What 
about its accountability to the public ?  As this audience  know s, when the  Federal Reserve 
was established,  the question of whether it should be a private or a public institution was 
highly contentious.  The compromise solution created a hybrid Federal Reserve System.  
The System was headed by a governmentally  appointed Board, which initially included  
the Secre tary of the Treasury and the Comptroller of the Currency .  But the 12 regional 
Reserve Banks were placed under a mixture of public and private oversight, including 
                                                 
9 See, for example, Eichengree n (1992 ). 
10 See Friedman and Schwartz (1963), Humphrey (1982), and Meltzer (2003).  
11 See Strong ( 1926 ).  - 5 - 
board members drawn from the private sector, and they  were given  considerable scope to 
make policy decisions that applied to their own Districts.  For example, Reserve Banks 
were permitted  to set their own discount rates , subject to a minimum set by the Board.  
While the founders of the  Federal Reserve hope d that this new institution would 
provide  financial and hence economic stability , the policy framework and the institutional 
structure would prove inadequate to the challenges the Fed would soon face.   
The Great Depression  
The Great Depression was the Federal Reserve’s most difficult test.  Tragi cally, 
the Fed failed to meet its mandate to maintain financial stability.  In particular, although 
the Fed provided substantial liquidity to the financial system following the 1929 stock 
market crash, its response to the subsequent banking panics was limi ted at best; the 
widespread bank failures and the collapse in money and credit that ensued were major 
sources of the economic downturn.12  Bagehot’s dictum to lend freely at a penalty rate in 
the face of panic appeared to have few adherents at the Federal R eserve of that era.13 
Economists have also  identified a number of instances from the late 1920s to the 
early 1930s when Federal Reserve officials, in the face of the sharp economic contraction 
and financial upheaval , either tightened monetary policy or chose inaction.  Some 
historians trace  these policy mistakes to  the early death of Benjamin Strong , governor  of 
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in 1928 , which left the decentralized system 
without an effective leader.14  Whether valid  or not , this hypothesis raises the interesting  
question of what intellectual framework a n effective leader would have drawn on at the 
                                                 
12 See Friedman and Schwartz (1963).  
13 Meltzer (2003, pp. 282, 729 -30) notes that Board members discussed Bagehot’s ideas but nevertheless 
did not integr ate them fully into their approach to policy.  
14 See Friedman and Schwartz  (1963, chapter 7).   - 6 - 
time to develop  and justify a more activist  monetary policy.  The degree to which  the 
gold standard actually  constrained U.S. monetary policy during the early 1930s  is 
debated; but the gold standard philosophy clearly did not encourage the sort of highly 
expansionary policies that were  needed.15  The same can be said for the real bills  
doctrine, which apparently led policymakers to conclude, on the basis of low nominal 
interest rates and low borrowings from the Fed, that monetary policy was appropriately 
supportive and that further actions would be fruitless .16  Historians have also noted the 
prevalence at the time of yet another coun terproductive doctrine:  the so -called 
liquidationist view, that depressions perform a necessary cleansing function.17  It may be 
that the Federal Reserve suffered less from lack of leadership in the 1930s than from the 
lack of an intellectual framework for  understanding what was happening and what needed 
to be done.  
The Fed’s inadequate  policy frameworks  ultimately collapsed under the weight of 
economic failures, new ideas, and political developments.  The international gold 
standard was abandoned during th e 1930s.  The real bills doctrine likewise lost prestige 
after the disaster of the 1930s; for  example, the Banking Act of 1935 instructed the 
Federal Reserve to use open market operations with  consideration of “the general credit 
situation of the country,” not just to focus narrowly on  short -term liquidity needs.18  The 
Congress also expanded the Fed’s ability to provide credit through the discount window, 
                                                 
15 Wicker (1965), Temin (1989), and Eichengreen (1992) suggest that U.S. policymakers felt constrained 
by the gold standard.  In contrast, Hsieh and Romer (2006), as well as Bordo, Choudhri, and Schwartz 
(2002), focus on the short -lived monetary expansion in  1932 as evidence against the existence of important 
constraints on the Federal Reserve.  
16 See Meltzer (2003) and Romer and Romer (2013).

allowing loans to a broader array of co unterparties, secured by a broader variety of 
collateral.19 
The experience of the Great Depression had major ramifications for all three 
aspects of the Federal Reserve I am discussing here:  its goals, its policy framework, and 
its accountability to the pub lic.  With respect to goals, the high unemployment of the 
Depression --and the fear that high unemployment would return after World War II --
elevated the maintenance of full employment as a goal of macroeconomic policy.   The 
Employment Act of 1946 made the p romotion of employment a general objective for the 
federal government.  Although the Fed did not have a formal employment goal until the 
Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977 codified “maximum employment,” along with 
“stable prices,” as part of the Fed’s so -called dual mandate, earlier legislation nudged the 
central bank in that direction.20  For example, legislators described the intent of the 
Banking Act of 1935 as  follows :  “To increase the ability of the banking system to 
promote stability of employment and  business, insofar as this is possible within the scope 
of monetary action and credit administration .”21  
The policy framework to support this new approach reflected the development of 
macroeconomic theories --including the work of Knut Wicksell, Irving Fish er, Ralph 
Hawtrey, Dennis Robertson, and John Maynard Keynes --that laid the foundations for 
understanding how monetary policy could affect real activity and employment and help 
                                                 
19 For example, section 10B enhanced the powers of the Federal Reserve to lend to member banks, and 
sections 13(3) and 13(13) enabled the Federal Reserve to provide short -term credit to a wide range of 
potential borrowers in specific circumstances.   
20 More precisely, the  three statutory objectives for monetary policy set forth in the Federal Reserve 
Reform Act of 1977 are maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long -term interest rates.  The 
dual mandate refers to the first two goals, and the long -term interest ra te goal is viewed as likely to emerge 
from the macroeconomic environment associated with achievement of the employment and price stability 
goals (Mishkin, 2007).  Thus, the interest rate goal of the Federal Reserve Reform Act can be regarded as 
subsumed wi thin the dual mandate.

reduce cyclical fluctuations.  At the same time, the Federal Reserve became les s focused 
on its original mandate of preserving financial stability, perhaps in part because it felt 
superseded by the creation during the 1930s of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
and the Securities and Exchange Commission, along with other refor ms intended to make 
the financial system more stable . 
In the area of governance  and accountability to the public , policymakers  also 
recognized the need for  reforms to improve the Federal Reserve’s  structure and  
decisionmaking.  The Banking Act of 1935 simu ltaneously bolstered the legal 
independence of the Federal Reserve and provided for stronger central control by the 
Federal Reserve Board.  In particular, the act created the modern configuration of the 
Federal Open Market Committee  (FOMC) , giving the Boar d the majority of votes on the 
Committee, while removing  the Secretary of the Treasury and the Comptroller of the 
Currency  from the Board.  I n practice , however, the Treasury continued to have 
considerable sway over  monetary policy after 1933, with o ne eco nomic historian 
describing  the Fed as “in the back seat. ”22  During World War II, the Federal Reserve 
used its tools to support the war financing efforts.  However, even after the war, Federal 
Reserve policy remained subject to considerable Treasury influen ce.  It was not until the 
1951 Accord  with the Treasury that the Federal Reserve began to recover genuine 
independence in setting monetary policy.     
The Great Inflation and Disinflation  
Once the Federal Reserve regained its policy independence, its goals centered on 
the price stability and employment objectives laid out in the Employment Act of 1946.  In 
the early postwar decades , the Fed used open market operations and the discount rate to 
                                                 
22 See Meltzer (2003).   - 9 - 
influence short -term market interest rates , and the federal funds rate gradually emerged as 
the preferred operating target.  Low and stable inflation  was achieved for most of the 
1950s and the early 1960s.  However, beginning in the mid -1960s, inflation began a long 
climb upward, partly because policymakers proved to be too optimistic about the 
economy’s ability to sustain rapid growth without inflation .23   
Two mechanisms might have  mitigated the damage from that mistaken optimism.   
First, a strong er policy response to inflation --more like that obs erved in the 1950s --
certainly would have helped.24  Second,  Fed policymakers could have reacted to 
continued high readings on inflation by adopting a more realistic assessment of the 
economy’s productive potential.25  Instead, policymakers chose to emphasize  so-called 
cost-push and structural factors as sources of inflation  and saw wage - and price -setting as 
having become insensitive to economic slack.26  This perspective, which contrasted 
sharply  with Milton Friedman’s famous dictum  that “inflation is always and everywhere 
a monetary phenomenon ,” led to Fed support for measures such as wage and price 
controls rather than monetary solutions to address inflation.27  A further obstacle was the 
view among many economists that the gains from low inflation did not ju stify the costs of 
achieving it.28  
The consequence  of the monetary framework of the 1970s was two bouts of 
double -digit inflation.  Moreover, by the end of the decade, lack of commitment to 
                                                 
23 See, for example, Orphanides (2003) and Meltzer (2009a).  
24 See Romer and Romer (2002 b). 
25 See Lars Svensson’s remarks in S tokey (2002, p. 63).  
26 See, for example, Poole (1979), Romer and Romer (2002a, 2013), Bernanke (2004), and Nelson (2005).  
27 Estimates of the response of the federal funds rate to inflation for the 1970s generally show only a weak 
reaction .  See Judd and Rudebusch (1998); Taylor  (1999a); and Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (2000).  For the 
quotation, see Friedman (1963, p.17).

inflation.   - 10 - 
controlling inflation had clearly resulted in inflation expectatio ns becoming 
“unanchored,” with high estimates of trend inflation embedded in longer -term interes t 
rates .   
As you know, u nder the leadership of Chairman Paul Volcker, the Federal 
Reserve  in 1979 fundamentally changed its approach to the issue of ensuring p rice 
stability .  This change  involved  an important rethinking on the part of policymakers.  By 
the end of the 1970s, Federal Reserve officials increasingly accepted the view that 
inflation is a monetary phenomenon,  at least in the medium and longer term; t hey became 
more  alert to the risks of excessive optimism about the economy’s potential output ; and 
they placed renewed emphasis  on the distinction between real --that is, inflation -
adjusted --and nominal interest rates.29  The change in policy framework was i nitially tied 
to a change in operating procedures that put greater focus on growth in bank reserves, but 
the critical change --the willingness to respond more vigorously to inflation --endured even 
after the Federal Reserve resumed its traditional use of the  federal funds rate as the policy 
instrument.30  The new regime also reflected an improved understanding of the 
importance of  providing a firm anchor, secured by the credibility of the central bank, for 
the private sector’s inflation expectations .31  Finally, it entailed a changed view about the 
                                                 
29 For discussion of these points, see Meltzer (2009b ). 
30 See, for example, Axilrod (1982).  
31 Central banks’ emphasis on expectations management partly reflected lessons from the rational 
expectations literature of the 1970s.  Monetary policy implications of the rational expectations literature 
were further clarified by later research.  For example, Sargent (1982) brought out dramatically the 
dependence of inflation expectations on the monetary policy regime in his study of major disinflations, 
while rational expectations models were extended to include stick y prices (Fischer, 1977; Taylor, 1980; 
Rotemberg, 1982; Calvo, 1983) and interest rate rules (Sargent and Wallace, 1975; McCallum, 1981; 
Taylor, 1993, 1999b; Woodford, 2003).   - 11 - 
dual mandate, in which policymakers regarded achievement of price stability as helping 
to provide the  condition s necessary for sustained maximum employment.32 
The Great Moderation  
Volcker’s successful battle a gainst inflation set the stage for the so -called  Great 
Moderation  of 1984 to 2007, during which the Fed enjoyed considerable success in 
achieving both objectives of its dual mandate.   Financial stability remained a goal, of 
course .  The Federal Reserve mon itored threats to financial stability and r esponded when 
the financial system was upset by events such as the 1987 stock market crash and the 
terrorist attacks of 2001 .  More routinely, it shared supervisory duties with other banking 
agencies .  Nevertheles s, for the most part, financial stability did not figure prominently in 
monetary policy discussions  during these years .  In retrospect, it is clear that 
macroeconomists --both inside and outside central banks --relied too heavily during th at 
period  on varian ts of the so -called Modigliani -Miller theorem, an implication of which is 
that the details of the structure of the financial system can be ignored when analyzing the 
behavior of the broader economy.  
An important development of the Great Moderation was the  increasing emphasis 
that central banks around the world put  on communication and transparency, as 
economists and policymakers  reached  consensus on the value of communication  in 
attaining monetary policy  objectives .33  Federal Reserve officials , like those at other 
central banks, had traditionally been highly guarded in their public pronouncements.  
They believed, for example, that the ability to take  markets by surprise  was important for 
                                                 
32 See Lindsey, Orphanides, and Rasche (2005). 
33 See Woodford (2005).   Many of the se principles were codified in the emerging doctrine of inflation 
targeting, the practice of which was greatly advanced by c entral banks in other countries .  One of the most 
notable examples is New Zealand’s introduction of inflation targeting  in 1990.   - 12 - 
influencing financial conditions .34  Thus, although Fed policymakers of  the 1980s and 
early 1990s had become somewhat more explicit about policy objectives and strategy, the 
same degree of transparency was not forthcoming on monetary policy decisions and 
operations.35  The release of a postmeeting statement  by the FOMC , a prac tice that began  
in 1994, was, therefore, an  important watershed .  Over time, t he statement  was expanded 
to include more detailed  information about the reason for the policy decision  and an 
indication of the balance of risks.36 
In addition to improving the effectiveness of monetary policy, these developments 
in communications also enhanced the public accountability of the Federal Reserve .  
Accountability is, of course, essential for policy independence in a democracy.  During 
this period, economists found considerable evidence that central banks that are afforded 
policy independence in the pursuit of their mandated objectives deliver better economic 
outcomes.37   
One cannot look back at the Great Moderation today without asking whe ther the 
sustained economic stability of the period somehow promoted the excessive risk -taking 
that followed.  The idea that this long period of calm lulled investors, financial firms, and 
financial regulators into paying insufficient attention to building  risks must have some 
truth in it.  I don’t think we should conclude, though, that we therefore should not strive 
to achieve economic stability.  Rather, the right conclusion is that, even in (or perhaps, 
especially in) stable and prosperous times, monetar y policymakers and financial 
                                                 
34 See, for example, Goodfriend (1986) and Cukierman and Meltzer (1986).  
35 See Orphanides (2006) for a discussion of the Federal Reserve’s move during the 1980s and 1990s to 
increased clarity about policy objectives.  
36 See Lindsey (2003).  
37 See Alesina and Sum mers (1993) and Debelle and Fischer (1994).   - 13 - 
regulators should regard safeguarding  financial stability to be of equal importance as --
indeed, a necessary prerequisite for --maintaining macroeconomic stability.  
Macroeconomists and historians will continue to debate the sour ces of the 
remarkable economic performance during the Great Moderation.38  My own view is that 
the improvements in the monetary policy framework and in monetary policy 
communication, including , of course , the better management of inflation and the 
anchoring  of inflation expectations, were important reasons for that strong performance.  
However, we have learned in recent years that while well -managed monetary policy may 
be necessary for economic stability, it is not sufficient.  
The Financial Crisis, the Great  Recession, and Today  
It has been about six years since the first signs of the financial crisis appeared in 
the United States, and we are still working to achieve a full recovery from its effects.  
What lessons should we take for the future from this expe rience, particularly in the 
context of a century of Federal Reserve history?  
The financial crisis and the ensuing Great Recession reminded us of a les son that 
we learned both in the 19 th century and  during the Depression  but had forgotten to some 
extent , which is that severe financial instability can do grave  damage to the broader 
economy.  The implication is that  a central bank must take into account risks to financial 
stability  if it is to help achieve good macroeconomic performance .  Today, t he Federal 
Reserve sees its responsibilities for the maintenance of financial stability as coequal with 
its responsibilities for the management of monetary policy, and we have made substantial 
                                                 
38 For a sampling of the debate, see Stock and Watson (2003); Ahmed, Levin, and Wilson (2004); Dynan, 
Elmendorf, and Sichel  (2006); and Davis and Kahn (2008).   - 14 - 
institutional changes in recognition of this change in goals .  In a sense,  we have come full  
circle, back to the original goal of the Federal Reserve of preventing financial panics .39   
How should a central bank enhance financial stability?  One means is by 
assuming the lender -of-last-resort function that Bageh ot understood and de scribed 
140 years ago, under which the central bank uses its power to provide liquidity to ease 
market conditions during periods of panic or incipient panic.  The Fed’s many liquidity 
programs played a central role in containing the crisis of 2008  to 2009.   However, putting 
out the fire is not enough; it is also important to foster a financial system that is 
sufficiently resilient to withstand large financial shocks.  Toward that end, the Federal 
Reserve, together with other regulatory agencies and the Fina ncial Stability Oversight 
Council, is actively engaged in monitoring financial developments and working to 
strengthen financial institutions and markets.  The reliance on stronger regulation is 
informed by the success of New Deal regulatory reforms , but cu rrent reform efforts go 
even further by working to identify and defuse risks not only to individual firms but to 
the financial system as a whole, an approach known as macroprudential regulation.   
Financial stability is also linked to monetary policy, thou gh these links are not yet 
fully understood.  Here the Fed’s evolving strategy is to make monitoring, supervision, 
and regulation the first line of defense against systemic risks; to the extent that risks 
remain, however, the FOMC strives to incorporate th ese risks in the cost -benefit analysis 
applied to all monetary policy actions.40 
What about the monetary policy framework?  In general, the Federal Reserve’s 
policy framework inherits many of the elements put in place during the Great 
                                                 
39 See Bernanke  (2011) .

Moderation.  These features include the emphasis on preserving the Fed’s inflation 
credibility, which is critical for anchoring inflation expectations, and a balanced approach 
in pursuing both parts of the Fed’s dual mandate in the medium term.  We have also 
continued to inc rease the transparency of monetary policy.  For example, the 
Committee’s communications framework now includes a statement of its longer -run 
goals and monetary policy strategy.41  In that statement, the Committee indicated that it 
judged that inflation at a  rate of 2 percent (as measured by the annual change in the price 
index for personal consumption expenditures) is most consistent over the longer run with 
the FOMC’s dual mandate.  FOMC participants also regularly provide estimates of the 
longer -run normal  rate of unemployment; those estimates currently have a central 
tendency of 5.2 to 6.0 percent.  By helping to anchor longer -term expectations, this 
transparency gives the Federal Reserve greater flexibility to respond to short -run 
developments.  This fram ework, which combines short -run policy flexibility with the 
discipline provided by the announced targets, has been described as constrained 
discretion.42  Other communication innovations include early publication of the minutes 
of FOMC meetings and quarterl y postmeeting press conferences by the Chairman.  
 The framework for implementing monetary policy has evolved further in recent 
years, reflecting both advances in economic thinking and a changing policy environment.   
Notably, following the ideas of Lars Sv ensson and others, the FOMC has moved  toward a  
framework  that ties policy settings more directly to the economic outlook, a so -called 
forecast -based approach .43  In particular, the FOMC has releas ed more detailed 
                                                 
41 The statement can be found at www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20120125c.htm . 
42 See Bernanke and Mishkin (1997).  
43 In a forecast -based approach, monetary policymakers inform the public of their medium -term targets --
say, a specific value for the inflation rate --and attempt to vary the instruments of policy as needed to meet  - 16 - 
statements following its meetings that have related the outlook for policy to prospective 
economic developments and has introduced regular summaries of the individual 
economic projections of FOMC participants (including for the target federal funds rate).   
The provision of additional information abo ut policy plans has helped Fed policymakers 
deal with the constraint posed by the effective  lower bound on short -term interest rates; in 
particular, b y offer ing guidance  about how policy will respond to economic 
developments, the Committee has been able to  increase  policy accommodation, even 
when the short -term interest rate is near zero and cannot be meaningfully reduced  
further .44  The Committee has also sought to influence interest rates further out on the 
yield curve, notably through i ts securities purch ases.  Other central banks in advanced 
economies, also confronted with the effective  lower bound on short -term interest rates, 
have taken similar measures.  
In short, the recent crisis has underscored the need both to strengthen our 
monetary policy and fina ncial stability frameworks and to better integrate the two.  We 
have made progress on both counts, but more needs to be done.  In particular, the 
complementarities among regulatory and supervisory policies (including macroprudential 
policy), lender -of-last-resort policy, and standard monetary policy are increasingly 
evident.  Both research and experience are needed to help the Fed and other central banks 
develop comprehensive frameworks that incorporate all of these elements.  The broader 
conclusion  is what  might be described as the overriding lesson of the Federal Reserve’s 
history:  that central banking doctrine and practice are never static.  We and other central 
                                                                                                                                                 
that target over time.  In contrast, an instr ument -based approach involves providing the public information 
about how the monetary policy committee plans to vary its policy instrument --typically, a short -term 
interest rate, like the federal funds rate --in response to economic conditions.  See Svensso n (2003).

banks around the world will have to continue to work hard to adapt to events, new ideas, 
and changes in the economic and financial environment.   - 18 -

Panel Discussion at the European Central Bank:  
Emerging from the Crisis :  Where Do We Stand?  
   
Remarks by  
 
Ben S. Bernanke  
 
Chairman  
 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  
 
at the  
 
Sixth European Central Bank Cent ral Banking Conference  
 
Frankfurt, Germany  
   
November 19, 2010 
 The last time I was here at the E uropean C entral Bank (ECB) , almost exactly two 
years ago , I sat on a distinguished panel much like this one  to help  mark  the 10th 
anniversary of the euro .  Even as we celebrated the remarkable achievements of the 
founders of the common currency, however, the global economy stood near the  precipice.  
Financial markets  were volatile and illiquid,  and the viability of some  of the world’s 
leading financial institutions had been  called into question.  With asset prices falling and 
the flow of credit to the nonfinancial sector constricted, most of the world’s economies 
had entered what would prove to be  a sharp and protracted economic downturn.   
 By the time of that meeting, the world ’s central banks had already taken 
significant steps to stabilize financial markets  and to mitigate  the worst effects of the 
recession , and they would go on to do much more.  Very broadly, the responses of central 
banks to the crisis fell into two  classes .  First , central banks undertook a range of 
initiatives to restore normal functioning to financial markets and to strengthen the banking system.  They expanded existing lending facilities and c reated new facilities to 
provide liquidity to the financial sector.  Key examples include the ECB’s one -year long -
term refinancing operations, the Federal Reserve’s auctions of discount window credit (via the Term Auction Facility), and the Bank of Japan’s  more recent extension of its 
liquidity supply operations.  To help satisfy banks’ funding needs in multiple currencies, central banks established liquidity swap lines  that allowed them to draw  each other’s 
currencies and lend those funds to financial inst itutions in their jurisdictions; the Federal 
Reserve ultimately established swap lines with 14 other central banks.  Central banks also worked to stabilize financial markets that were important conduits of credit to the nonfinancial sector.  For example, t he Federal Reserve launched facilities to help stabilize - 2 - 
 
 
 the commercial paper market and the market for asset -backed securities, through which 
flow much of the funding for student, auto, credit card, and small business loans as well 
as for commercial mortg ages.   In addition, the Federal Reserve, the ECB, the Bank of 
England, the Swiss National Bank, and other central banks played important roles in 
stabilizing and strengthening their respective banking systems.  In particular, central banks helped develop and oversee stress tests that assessed banks’ vulnerabilities and capital needs.  These tests proved instrumental in reducing investors’ uncertainty about banks’ assets and prospective losses, bolstering confidence in the banking system , and 
facilitating banks’ raising of private capital.   Central banks are also playing an important 
ongoing role in the development of new international capit al and liquidity s tandards for 
the banking system that will help protect against future crises.  
Second , beyond necessary measures to stabilize financial markets and banking 
systems,  central banks moved proactively to ease monetary policy to help support their 
economies.  Initially , monetary policy was eased through the conventional means of cuts 
in short -term policy rates, including a coordinated rate cut in October 2008 by the Federal 
Reserve, the ECB, and other leading central banks.  However, as policy r ates approached 
the zero lower bound, central banks eased policy by additional means.  For example, some central banks, including the Federal Reserve, sought to reduce longer -term interest 
rates  by communicating that policy  rates were likely to remain low for some time.  A 
prominent example of the use of central bank communication to further ease policy was  
the Bank of Canada ’s conditional commitment to keep rates near zero until the end of the - 3 - 
 
 
 second quarter of 2010.1  To p rovide additional monetary accommodation, s everal central 
banks --among  them the Fed eral Reserve, the Bank of England, the ECB, and the B ank of 
Japan --purchase d significant quantities of financial assets , including  government debt, 
mortgage -backed securities, or covered bonds, depending on the central bank.  Asset 
purchases seem to have been effective in easing financial conditions; for example, the 
evidence suggests that such purchases significantly  lowered long er-term interest rates in 
both the United States and the United Kingdom.2
   Although the efforts of central banks to stabilize the financial system and provide 
monetary accommodation helped set  the stage for recovery, economic growth rates in the 
advanced economies  have been relatively  weak.   Of course, t he economic outlook varies 
importantly by country and region, and the policy responses to these developments 
among central banks have differed according ly.  In the United States, we have seen a 
slowing of t he pace of expansion since earlier this year .  The u nemployment  rate has 
remained  close to 10 percent  since mid -2009, with  a substantial fraction  of the 
unemployed out of work for six  months or longer .  Moreover, i nflation has been 
declining and is currently quite low , with measures of underlying inflation running close 
to 1 percent .  Although we project that economic growth will pick up and unemployment 
decline somewhat in the coming year , progress thus far has been disappointingly slow.    
 In this environment , the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) judged that 
additional monetary policy accommodation was needed to support the e conomic recovery 
and help ensure that inflation, over time, is at desired levels .  Accordingly , the FOMC 
                                                           
1 Recent work at the Bank of Canada (see He, 2010) suggests that the b ank’s forward guidance may have 
pushed back expectations of when policy accommodation would be withdrawn.   For a differing view, see 
Chehal and Trehan (2009).  
2 For the United States,  see Gagnon and others (2010), D’Amico and King (2010), and Hamilton and Wu 
(2010) ; for the United Kingdom, see Joyce and others (2010).  - 4 - 
 
 
 announced e arlier  this month its intention to purchase an additional $600 billion of 
longer -term Treasur y securities  by the end of the second quarter of 2011, a pace of about  
$75 billion per month.  The Committee also will maintain its current policy of reinvesting 
principal payments from its securities holdings in longer -term Treasur y securities .  
Financial conditions eased notably in anticipation of the Committee’s announcement, suggesting that this policy will be effective  in promoting recovery. As has been the case  
with more conventional monetary policy  in the past , this policy action will be regularly 
reviewed in light of the evolving economic outlook and the Committee’s assessment of the effects of its policies  on the economy.   
 I draw several lessons from our collective experience in dealing with the crisis .  
(My list is by no means exhaustive. )  The first lesson  is that, in a world in which the 
consequences of financial crises can be devastating,  fostering f inancial stability is a 
critical part of overall macroeconomic management.  Accordingly, c entral banks and 
other financial regulators must be vigilant in  monitoring financial markets  and 
institutions for threats to systemic stability  and diligent in taking steps to address such 
threats.  S upervision of i ndividual financial institutions , macroprudential monitoring, and 
monetary policy are mutually reinforcing undertakings, with active involvement in one sphere providing crucial information and expertise for the others.  Indeed, at the Federal 
Reserve, we h ave restructured  our financial supervisory functions so that staff members 
with expertise in a range of areas --including economics, financial markets, and 
supervision--work closely together in evaluating potential risks . 
  Second , the past two years have demonstrated the value of policy flexibility and 
openness to new approaches .  During the crisis , central banks were creative and - 5 - 
 
 
 innovative, developing programs that played a significant role in easing financial stress 
and supporting economic activity.  As  the global financial system and national economies  
become increasing ly complex and interdependent, novel policy challenges will continue 
to require innovative policy responses.  
 Third, as was the focus of my remarks two years ago, i n addressing financial 
crises , international cooperation can be very helpful ; indeed, given the global integration 
of financial markets, such cooperation is essential .  Central bankers worked closely 
together throughout the crisis and continue to do so.  Our frequent contact, whether in bilateral discussions or in international meetings, permits us to share our thinking , 
compare analyses , and stay informed of developments  around the world.  It also enables  
us to move quickly when shared problems  call for swift joint responses, such as the 
coordinated rate cuts and  the creation of  liquidity swap lines  during the crisis .  These 
actions and others we’ve taken over the past few years  underscore our resolve to work 
together to address our common economic challenges.

June 25, 2023  It is a pleasure to be with you here in Salzburg.1  Bank r egulators, particularly in the 
United States, have come to an inflection point where we are again taking stock of the reforms 
implemented after the 2008 financial crisis and evaluating whether these reforms have proven to 
be sufficient .  One justification for pushing these reviews forward has been the recent stress in 
the banking system .   
The regulatory framework has evolved substantially since  the 2008 financial crisis.   The 
regulatory landscape has become more restrictive, with large in creases in capital and liquidity 
requirements, and other post -crisis reform s to improve bank resiliency.  S ince that time, the 
banking landscape has also evolved.  Today, to stay competitive, banks need to be able to 
quickly adopt new and innovative technology .   
My remarks this afternoon will address  the importance of a responsive  and responsible 
regulatory framework, including regulation and supervision.  A responsive framework adapt s 
quickly to changing economic conditions, changing business activities a nd models, and emerging 
risks.  A responsible framework enables regulators to make changes that are informed by open 
debate and take into account intended and unintended consequences.  These two concepts —
adapting to changing conditions, and transparency ab out regulatory adjustments —are 
intertwined .  They inform my view about how bank regulation should evolve and adapt over 
time.  This is particularly relevant now in light of the calls for reform of the regulatory 
framework, motivated in part by a  desire to remediate perceived weaknesses that contributed to  
recent bank failures .

Responsive  Regulation  and Supervision  
This year, we have seen the failures  of Silicon Valley Bank  (SVB),  Signature Bank 
(Signature) , and First Republic Bank, and the merger of Credit Suisse into UBS.  In the United 
States, the bank f ailures of SVB and Signature were accompanied by government intervention in 
the form of a guarantee on uninsured deposits  at these institutions, and the creation of a new , 
broad-based,  emergency liquidity facility designed to calm markets and provide reass urance 
about the underlying strength of the U.S. banking system.  T hese bank failures also highlighted 
the need for regulators to consider reform efforts  to make the financial system stronger and more 
resilient.  
Many of the problems we have seen at these banks —interest rate risk, liquidity risk, poor 
risk management —are not caused by any evolution in banking.  These b ank failures and recent 
stress in the banking system have highlighted key deficiencies in risk man agement practices , and 
key deficiencies in  supervisory priorities .  The Federal Reserve and other banking agencies have 
been trying to determine what more can be done to respond to the recent stress, but we also need 
to reflect on how reform efforts can le ad to the best results, while minimizing unintended 
consequences.  
Independent Review  
In my view , a necessary next step is to engage an independent third party to analyze the 
surrounding events of the recent bank failures to fully understand the factors and circumstances 
that contributed to the recent bank failures and to the ensuing stress in the banking system.2

Several efforts have been undertaken to provide  this type of after-the-fact review .3  Much of the  
work  done to date  has been helpful and has brought to light some uncomfortable realities about 
the lead -up to the bank failures.  But much of this work was prepared internally , by Federal 
Reserve supervision staff, relying on a limited number of unattributed source interviews,  and 
completed on an expedited timeframe with a limited scope .  Although the report was published 
as a report of the Board  of Governors , it was the product of  one Board Member, and was not 
reviewed by the other members of the Board prior to its publica tion.  Troublingly, other Board 
members were afforded no ability to contribute to the report’s content .  There is a genuine 
question whether these efforts provide a sufficient accounting of what occurred.  A 
supplemental, independent review would help over come the limitations of scope and timing of 
these initial efforts, and address concerns about the impartiality and independence of the reviews.   
Additional, independent reviews could add substantial value .4  These  reviews should play 
an important role in informing the future path of supervision and regulation.   The diagnosis of 
what went wrong can  help inform necessary changes to supervision and regulation,  the Fed’s

emergency authorities  and liquidity tools , and the resolution, auction , and insurance  process es of 
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) .   Misperceptions  and misunderstandings  
about the root causes and related issues could result in changes that are not only unnecessary but  
result in real harm to banks and their customers, to the financial system, and to the broader 
economy.  
The policy agenda —the set of reforms to supervision and regulation that are intended to 
remediate perceived shortcomings —has already begun to take shape , driven by the conclusions  
from the curre nt set of limited reviews .  And while I think some changes to supervision and 
regulation —such as a renewed examination focus on core banking risks like liquidity and 
interest rate risk  and a careful review of liquidity requirements and expectations —are warranted 
and helpful, I am concerned that other  reforms  may be based on faulty assumptions or 
incomplete information.    
In particular, as the United States move s forward with implementing new international 
capital standards, I am concerne d that new capital requirements could unnecessarily hinder  bank 
lending and diminish competition .  We need to consider whether examiners have the appropriate 
tools and support to identify important issues and demand prompt remediation.   Increasing 
capital requirements simply does  not get at this underlying concern about the effectiveness of 
supervision.    
I have heard the argument that recent bank stress was the result of changes Congress 
made several years ago to promote risk-based and tailored supervision,  and a shift to a less 
assertive supervisory approach.  I have not seen compelling evidence to support this.  As I and 
many of my colleagues have noted, the banking system today is strong and resilient , despite - 5 - 
recent banking stress .5  This is  in no small part due to the extensive reforms implemented after 
the 2008 financial crisis.   Banks today are much better capitalized, with substantially more 
liquidity, and are subject to a new range of supervisory tools that did not exist prior to 2008.  The 
strong foundation of the banking system results in banks that are well prepared to continue 
lending to their communities and support ing the broader economy even in stressful economic 
times .  The underlying strength and resilience of the banking system also begs the question—
what are the justifications for higher capital requirements?  
Supervisory Reform  
Supervisory reform proposals —particularly those that address a perceived retreat from 
robust  supervision over the last few years —could similarly be improved by additional review , 
analysis, and discussion.  T he notion that any regulator, including the Federal Reserve , would 
purpose fully promote a less assertive supervisory approach or try to limit the ability of examiners 
to identify  issues and require remediation , is inconsistent with every experience of my nearly 14 
years in the professional banking and regulatory environments —as a banker, a state bank 
commissioner, and as a member of the Federal Reserve Board .6  Supervision has long been and

continues to be a critical element of the regulatory framework at the Federal Reserve, the other 
U.S. banking agencies, and internationally.  While I have long been an advocate for greater 
transparency in supervision, transparency should not be  mistaken for leniency.7  When we 
provide regulated institutions with clear expectations, and institutions fail to live up to those 
expectations, examiners are better positioned to require prompt remediation.  T his approach 
results in  greater consistency and fairness and supports bank efforts to meet supervisory 
expectations  by facilitating  open engagement  with examiners.  
Echoes of the Past 
The recent banking stress presents many of the same dynamics that led to the s avings and 
loan crisis in the 1980s .  Savings and loan institutions  have been and continue to be important 
providers of banking services in the United States, but during the 1980s many of these 
institution s failed .  These institutions experienced a period of rapid asset growth, followed by 
rapidly rising interest rates  that depressed the value of some of the se assets and an erosion of 
customer confidence that led to deposit withdrawals.   
Many of these same dynamics  create d banking stress over the past few months , but the

ultimately fatal to the bank.  It seems obvious  that reform efforts should concentrate on 
supervision progr ams and their effectiveness in identifying material risks  to banking institutions . 
It is incumbent on policymakers, as we revisit the regulatory framework, to pursue policy 
informed by an impartial review of the facts .  There are several areas where it is apparent that 
improvements are needed—more effective communication among regulators and within the 
Federal Reserve  System and Board’s supervisory program , greater transparency in supervisory 
expectations  with enforceable and timely consequences when expect ations are not met , a focus 
on the most relevant banking risks  with a demonstrated nexus to bank stability and safety and 
soundness , and a clearly articulated and implementable approach to the supervision of novel 
banking activities .   
One area in particul ar that requires attention is the current approach to the supervision of 
novel banking activities , which  leaves financial institutions in a supervisory void.  While there 
have been some efforts to provide guidance, there remains substantial uncertainty about the 
permissibility of and supervisory expectations for these activities , including banking as a service, 
digital assets , and other novel activit ies.  This leaves banks in the perilous position of relying on 
general but non -binding statements by policymakers only to be criticized at some  point in the 
future .  The absence of a clear regulatory and supervisory approach creates the risk that 
regulators may determ ine novel activities  are impermissible or impose new requirements and 
expectations on these  activities after the fact  and, for some first movers, after significant 
investment .  If our role is effective supervision and regulation, we must be willing to enga ge on 
both the novel and traditional activities.      
These  changes in supervisory approach could help remediate current shortcomings and 
build capacity to embrace, evolve with , and respond to emerging risks.  Failure to follow this - 8 - 
approach could have significant consequences for banks navigating higher interest rates while 
meet ing the credit and financial needs of  their customers.  
Responsible Reform of the Regulatory Framework   
A review of bank regulation would be incomplete without  a discus sion of  some basic 
principles for how the regulatory framework should evolve over time .  In my view, r esponsible 
reforms reflect and incorporate a number of principles I have spoken about in the past:  a 
commitment to transparency, accountability, efficien cy, and due process .8  These considerations 
are all important, but one overlooked aspect of responsible reform is the imperative of evaluating 
the consequences  of revisions .  I view this as an extension of the need for efficiency.  A broader 
consideration of consequences does not assume the need for a particular reform, but instead takes 
into account h ow a particular policy change would interact with the regulatory framework  and 
the impact on the broader financial system.  
In thinking through regulatory reform, it is critical to understand the context.  
Requirements for c apital, liquidity, resolution plan s, stress testing, and supervisory approach are 
all elements of the regulatory framework .  Each of these  complement s the other s in support of 
safety and soundness .  So, when considering reforms , we must think about which tools are most 
effective and efficient in addressing identified shortcomings.   I expect that w e will find 
improvements to supervision, revisions to liquidity requirements, or  improvements to bank

preparedness to access liquidity  are more effective than increases in capital  for a broad set of 
banks , especially during a time of economic uncertainty.  
Last year,  the U .S. banking regulators confirmed their commitment to implementing the 
Basel III endgame reforms, and I expect a proposal for public comment will be published this 
summer .9  I intend to approach the proposal with an open mind, as we  consider taking 
appropriate and measured steps to reform the U.S. capital framework .  I support providing 
sufficient time , of at least 120 days,  for industry and stakeholders to review and provide 
comment on the proposal .   
A key element of the rulemaking process i s openness and transparen cy.  In the past, the 
Board has held public meetings to consider rules of significance .  During the pandemic, the 
Board largely departed from this practice .  I believe we should return to having more public, 
open meetings on matters of importance.  Public Board meetings enable Board m embers to air 
their views and perspectives and raise potential concerns about how proposals will affect 
economic activity and financial stability.   Public meet ings also promote accountability by 
allowing interested parties to hear the discussion and debate among policymakers on matters that 
directly affect them.  
As we and other regulators around the world begin the process for implementing the final 
elements of the Basel III international capital framework, it is imperative that we understand 
both the underlying goals of these changes and the ir practical impacts.   When policymakers raise 
capital requirements, the tendency can be to singularly focus on the  perceived  benefits —higher 
capital implies greater resiliency of the banking system .  But there’s a tradeoff.  Resiliency, in

Comptroller of the Currency, ""Agencies Reaffirm Commitment to Basel III Standards"" joint press release

terms of higher capital, comes at a cost —namely, decreased credit availability and increased cost 
of credit in normal times —and ca n have broad impacts on banks, the broader financial system, 
and the economy.  
One of the core objectives of the  Basel capital standards is to promote a level playing 
field internationally among banks subject to the standards.   This objective can be challen ging to 
evaluate —the business activities, structure, and broader financial landscape varies significantly 
from country to country, which complicates a horizontal evaluation of capital standards across 
jurisdictions.  And while Basel capital standards are n egotiated and internationally agreed to 
among financial regulators , they also require implementation by each  of the many jurisdiction s.   
In contrast, r egulators in the United States have often adopted “gold-plating” for 
international Basel capital standar ds during implementation, layering on higher or expanded 
requirements  above those adopted internationally, including an added stress capital buffer,  the 
enhanced supplementary leverage ratio,  and the “method two ” calculation methodology  for the 
global syst emically important bank ( G-SIB ) surcharge.   Some gold-plating in the United States is 
the product of Congressional directives, like the so-called Collins floor, which requires large 
U.S. banks to calculate their capital requirements using multiple methodol ogies and apply the 
one result ing in higher aggregate capital requirements.   This is not an indictment of the robust 
capital standards we have in the United States today , but this U.S. gold -plating is the current 
baseline  as we consider the impact of future capital changes . 
While some deviation in standards is to be expected during local implementation of 
international capital requirements , policymakers should not ignore the underlying goal of 
promoting international consistency and parity.  We often s ee deviations across jurisdictions to 
adjust to local market conditions and for other reasons, often by including extended phase -in - 11 - 
periods or reducing the size of capital increases.  G old-plating U.S. standards could further 
exacerbate the existing differ ences in international capital standards.  W e should be mindful of 
how such jurisdiction -specific  deviation s could impact international banking activities and cross -
border competition.  While the policy objective in implementing capital standards is not to  
disadvantage U.S. banks in non-U.S. markets, or to give a n advantage  to foreign banks operating 
in the United States, if international capital standards present substantial variability across 
jurisdictions, they could have detrimental consequences . 
Non-Bank Financial Services Firms  
The effects of capital, however, extend well beyond the impact on international 
competition , particularly in light of the growing role of non-bank companies in financial 
services, the so -called shadow banking system .  Non-bank  competitors, who often already have a 
pricing advantage , compet e in many of the same markets as banks without the same regulatory 
expectations .  Rising bank capital requirements may exacerbate the competitive dynamics  that 
result in  advantages to non-bank competitors  and push additional financial activity out of the 
regulated banking system.  This  shift—while possibly leaving a stronger and more resilient 
banking system —could create a financial system in which banks simply can’t compete in a cost -
effective  manner .  The shadow banking system has many connections to the regulated banking 
system .  Even the resiliency of a smaller, safer banking system could prove illusory when we 
look deeper into the connections between banks and non-banks , for example, with subscription 
lines of credit supporting the private credit industry, and the indirect bank-financing of non-bank 
mortgage lending activities through traditional bank credit lines . - 12 - 
How much and what types of financial activity should exist inside versus outs ide the 
regulated financial sector?  We should be aware that making banks safer and sounder by pushing 
activity and risk to the shadow banking system may not make the broader financial system safer .   
Regu latory Influence on Banking Products and Services  and the Broader Banking System  
Regulation has the power to dramatically reshape banking by affecting which products 
and services  banks offer , the price of financial services, and the competitive landscape.  
Regulation can affect whether certain banks will be insulated from competition , ensconcing too-
big-to-fail institutions atop the banking system  and reducing competition and the availability of 
banking services in certain product markets and geographies .  A thorough consideration of  these 
dynamic s should be a key element of regulatory reform.  
Availability of Products  
Beyond the effects of capital on competition  with foreign firms and non-banks , capital 
requirements can also have a direct impact on bank willingness and ability to engage in core 
banking activities .  Bank s pursue business strategies and offer products not despite capital 
requirements, but with the full knowledge and understanding of the capital allocations required  
to engage in that activity .  Increasing capital requirements can result in banks retreating from 
certain activities .  The net result of a pullback could be higher costs  due to the pass -through of 
higher regulatory requirements,  or less availability of certain products and services for 
consumers .  This could also increas e concentration risks among competitors  that remain in 
certain product markets.    
Policymakers should fully consider  these real -world consequences and  engage in a 
transparent and public discussion of the pros and cons of options for capital reform.  Banking 
regulatory and supervisory policy—including capital policy—should be focused on promoting a - 13 - 
safe and sound banking system .  I am concerned about the adopt ion of  reforms that attempt to 
steer banks toward or away from business activities.  Bank regulators are not and should not  be 
in the business of making capital allocation decisions regarding bank lending.   In the same way, 
bank regulators should also not direct bank bus iness stra tegy about the products and services  
offered  by establishing capital requirements that are disproportionate to risk . 
Regulatory Reform and the Banking Landscape  
A broader concern about regulatory policy, of which capital requirements are an 
impor tant component, is the impact on the broader banking landscape.  A regulator’s initial 
reaction to a bank failure may be to increase capital costs, focusing on the impact of increased 
capital  on the failed bank and limiting consideration of that impact to the point  of the failure.  In 
that narrow test sample, there is no doubt that more capital is preferable and would improve 
solvency.  But broader regulatory reform does not impact only one bank, or impact only banks 
experiencing significant banking stress,  or only banks that have a history of mismanagement.   
Broad -based changes can a ffect the incentives of the various tiers of firms.  For example, 
flattening regulatory requirements —imposing the same high bar on all firms over a certain 
size—at first blush seems like it would improve financial resiliency.  But we should not assume 
that the banking system would remain static in response to uniform high er regulatory  standards 
across institutions of dramatically different size s, complexity,  business model s, and risk.    
Eliminating banking standards tailored for these characteristics would create intense 
pressure on the smaller end of that spectrum to consolidat e, as smaller banks struggle to adapt to 
regulation ill-suited for their size or complexity, appl ying instead regulation s designed for a 
G-SIB .  My intuition is that this type of  approach could become a self -fulfilling prophecy, as 
banks regulated like G -SIBs would have strong incentives to grow or merge, to help develop - 14 - 
economies of scale  that come w ith larger size .  Instead of addressing the problem  of too-big -to-
fail banks, regulation could become a tool that insulates too-big -to-fail banks from competition 
from  smaller competitors.  
Fundamentally, this raises the question of the ongoing role of tail oring in supervision and 
regulation.  The concept of t ailoring —of aligning supervision and regulation with bank risk and 
complexity , alternatively called risk -based supervision—has recently come under threat of being 
eroded through regulatory reform efforts  in the United States .10  The tailoring  approach has long 
been a feature of regulation and supervision in the United States , and I think it provides  a useful 
framework for how to think about responsible approaches to regulatory reform.   
The Potential Impact of Risk -Insensitive Regulatory Reform on Banks and Competition 
What are the consequences of deviat ing from risk-based supervision and tailoring, when 
we apply standards designed for larger and more complex firms  to smaller and simpler firms ?   
As an academic matter , and operating in a vacuum, higher standards imply that banks get 
safer ; they hold more capital , face increased  scrutiny by examiners , and are subjected to higher 
standards on all aspects of their business.  But we need to consider whether this is truly 
necessary, and if implemented, what would be the practical outcome?   
Under the weight of overly burdensome  or redundant  regulation , the business models of 
some  banks may simply cease to be viable.  Many banks would be unable to operate under the 
weight of increased compliance costs.  Of course, the banking system cannot tolerate unlimited risk, and regulatory policy bears within it the choice about how much risk is appropriate within

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bowman -statement -20230606.htm  (“[O]ne size fits all 
regulatory expectations for banks, including small banks, and failing to appropriately consider and mitigate the 
compliance and implementation burden imposed on these small banks, signals a concerning trend in our regulatory 
approach .”). - 15 - 
the banking s ystem.  While conservatism, and ensuring safety and soundness, may be appropriate  
to some degree, at a certain point regulatory requirements become unmoored from risk and force 
good banks out of the market.   
The consequences  of excessive and overlapping regulation s will inevitably be forced 
consolidat ion and reduc ed consumer  choice, especially in underserved banking markets.  Even in 
the absence of consolidation, banks always face choices in responding to regulation, and may 
pare back on lending to small businesses, or forfeit their banking charter and choose to operate 
instead within the nonbank sector.   Overregulation in trading book capital requirements  could 
increas e the cost of market -making —impacting the liquidity of debt and equity markets —and 
increas e the cost of market funding.   We cannot understate the potential impacts.  Communities 
often fund local infrastructure projects by issuing municipal bonds in public debt markets.  If this 
funding source evaporates, or becomes more expensive, that can have severe consequences for 
these communities.  Banking is not risk-free, and the goal of the regulatory framework is to 
support the safe and sound operation of banks , not to eliminate risk altogether . 
If one is concerned about those who ar e underserved in the current market, it is necessary 
to understand that different sizes of banks often meet the specific banking needs of unique 
communities and customers  in geographic areas or within product lines that may not  provide a 
variety of  options .  Smaller banks support their communities in unique ways, and often have 
deeper community ties and commitments than out -of-market competitors without direct 
relationships to their community.   There seems to be a  misperception  by some —based solely on 
the a ggregate number of banks in the United States —that there are simply too many bank 
charters competing for too little business.  It is difficult to know what the optimum number of - 16 - 
banks in the banking system may be , but it is important to recognize that the number of charters 
does not tell the whole story.   
A real concern is whether regulatory reform could have the unintended consequence of 
hollowing out the mid-sized tier of banks, effectively prevent ing the large st banks from facing 
new competition.  If we believe in the virtue of competition as a way to spur innovation and 
improve customer choice , we need to be cautious about less risk -sensitive regulatory and 
supervisory expectations.  If we were to apply some  of the same heightened standards for banks 
with $50 billion or $100 billion in assets as we have for banks with trillions of dollars in assets, this inevitably would create pressure to merge to create economies of scale to lessen the cost of 
regulatory compliance , resulting in further bank consolidat ion.  By doing so, we would eliminate 
the current dynamic banking system that incorporates institutions  regulated in tiers.   We would 
prevent the next large bank from growing to be a viable competitor, and essent ially permanently 
and officially designate a handful of banks as “too big to fail,” despite years of policymaker 
effort s fighting against the perceived government guarantee of only the largest banks .  Our goal 
should not be to create a “barbell” of banking institutions based on size, with a small number of 
too-big-to-fail banks at the large end of the spectrum, and some smaller community banks at the 
low end.  
Bank regulation is most effective when it adapts to changing economic conditions, 
changing business activities and models, and emerging risks.  But policymakers should not be 
shortsighted about the potential consequences of policy change s, consequences that may have 
long-term effects on the contours of the banking system .  Driving activity out of  banks into the 
shadow banking system does not make the financial system safer, it simply makes banks less 
competitive, and increases economic and financial stability risks.  As we consider the evolution - 17 - 
of the financial system, and the current and future role of banks  within it, a renewed focus on 
unintended consequences is a particularly important topic to consider  and would ensure that our 
actions  support resiliency in the global financial system.   
Closing Thoughts  
My remarks today should not be interpreted as a categorical rejection of reform efforts.  
Some  reform efforts —to both regulation and supervision—are  a natural part of the evolution of 
the regulatory framework, and some would address weaknesses revealed by the recent bank 
failures .  There is room to improve bank supervision for large banks , particularly those in 
Category IV of the U.S. tailoring framework, and we need to evaluate whether our regulations 
could have inadvertently contributed to stress in the b anking system.11  But these reform efforts 
should be both informed by an impartial and independent review of what led to the failures  and 
healthy public debate, which should take into account the unintended consequence s of reform .  
We must be circumspect a bout what went wrong, deliberate about what to fix, and cognizant of 
unintended consequences.  It is imperative that we preserve a dynamic banking sector, with 
banks of all sizes that serve the needs of their unique customers wherever they are located.  
It is abundantly clear that  regulatory and supervisory reform  is on the way.  But we 
should ensure that changes ultimately promote a safe and sound banking system .  That system 
should serve the needs of customers and support the broader economy.

59th Annual Meeting of the National Association  for Business Economics 
Cl
eveland, Ohio 
Se
ptember 26, 2017  
I would like to thank the National Association for Business Economics for 
inviting me to speak today and for the vital role the association plays in fostering debate 
on important economic policy questions.   
Today I will discuss uncertainty and monetary po licy, particularly as it relates to 
recent inflation developments.  Because changes in interest rates influence economic 
activity and inflation with a substantial lag, the Federal Open Market Committee 
(FOMC) sets monetary policy with an eye to its effects on the outlook for the economy.  
But the outlook is subject to considerable uncertainty from multiple sources, and dealing 
with these uncertainties is an important feature of policymaking.  Key among current  
uncertainties  are the forces driving inflation , which has remained low in recent years 
despite substantial improvement in labor market conditions .  As I will discuss, this low 
inflation likely reflects factors whose influence should fade over time.  But as I will also 
discuss, many uncertainties attend  this assessment, and downward pressures on inflation 
could prove to be unexpectedly persistent.  My colleagues and I may have misjudged the 
strength of the labor market, the degree to which longer -run inflation expectations are 
consistent with our inflati on objective, or even the fundamental forces driving inflation.  
In interpreting incoming data, we will need to stay alert to these possibilities and, in light 
of incoming information, adjust our views about inflation, the overall economy, and the 
stance o f monetary policy best suited to promoting maximum employment and price 
stability.   
Recent I nflatio n Developments and the O utlook  
Let me begin by reviewing recent inflation developments and the economic 
outlook.  As the solid blue line in figure 1 indicates, i nflation  as measured by the price  - 2 - 
index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) has generally run below the FOMC’s 
2 percent longer -run objective since that goal  was announced  in January 2012.1  Core 
inflation, which strips out volatile foo d and energy prices, has also fallen persistently 
short of 2 percent (the red dashed line).  Furthermore, both overall and core inflation, 
after moving up appreciably l ast year, have slipped  again  in recent months .  Sustained 
low inflation such as this is undesirable because, among other things, it generally leads to 
low settings of the federal funds rate in normal times, thereby providing less scope to 
ease monetary policy to fight recessions.  In addition, a persistent  undershoot of our 
stated 2 percent goal could undermine the FOMC’s credibility, causing inflation 
expectations  to drift and actual inflation and economic activity to become more volatile.   
As noted in its recent statement, t he FOMC continues to anticipate that, with 
gradual adjustments in t he stance of monetary policy, inflation will rise and  stabilize at 
around 2 percent over the medium term .  This expectation is illustrated by the green stars, 
which represent the medians of the inflation projections submitted by FOMC participants 
at our me eting last week.  In part, this expectation reflects the significant improvement in 
labor market conditions over the past few years.  As shown in figure 2, t he 
unemployment rate (the blue line) now stands at 4.4 percent, somewhat below the median 
of FOMC participants’ estimates of its longer- run sustainable level  (the black line).  As 
the green stars indicate, labor market conditions are  expected to strengthen a bit  further.  
The inflation outlook also reflects the Committee’s judgment that inflation expectations 
will remain reasonably well anchored at a level consisten t with PCE price inflation of 
2 percent in the long run, and that the restraint imposed in recent years by a variety of

www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf .  - 3 - 
special factors, including movements in the relative  prices of food, energy, and imports, 
will wane in coming quarters.   
To understand this  assessment , it is useful to decompose the forces driving 
movements in inflation since the financial crisis, as estimated using a simple model of 
inflation  that I prese nted in a speech two years ago .2  Figure 3 reports this decomposition 
as the contributions made by various factors to the shortfall of PCE price inflation from 
2 percent , year by year .  As illustrated by the purple dotted portion of the bars, labor 
under utilization , or “slack ,” accounts for a shrinking share of the shortfall since 2012 and 
is now having a negligible effect.  By comparison, the influence of changes in relative 
food, energy, and import prices --the solid blue and checkered red portions --has be en 
more substantial  in the past few years, although their contribution is estimated to have 
greatly diminished this year.3  
Not surprisingly, the simple model does not account for all of the year -to-year 
movements in inflati on.  As indicated by the green s triped portion of the bars, the residual 
compone nt of the shortfall was modestly  positive on average from 2008 through last year.  
This year, however, inflation has been unexpectedly weak from the model’s perspective.  
This unusually large error does not necessarily imply that inflation is more  likely to 
                                                 
2 The simple model links the current rate of inflation t o several factors, including lagged inflation, long -run 
inflation expectations, labor utilization, and changes in the relative prices of food, energy and imports  
(Yellen, 2015).  Additional details on the model can be found in the appendix.      
3 In the decomposition procedure, movements in core inflation affect headline inflation one -for-one; as a 
result, the contributions of food and energy price inflatio n are defined as each component’ s price change 
relative to the core, weighted by its share in total n ominal consumer spe nding.   The estimated contribution 
of movements in import prices is also computed relative to core inflation; thus, if import prices are rising at 
the same rate as core inflation, they have no estimated effect on the shortfall of overall  inflation from 
2 percent.  In addition, the decomposition takes account of lags in the adjustment of core inflation to 
movements in resource utilization and other factors.   More details on the decomposition procedure can be 
found in the appendix.   - 4 - 
continue to come in on the low  side in coming years .4  Some of the recent decline in  
inflation , although not all, reflects  idiosyncratic  shifts  in the prices of some items, such as 
the large decline in telecommunic ation service  price s seen earlier in the year, that are 
unlikely to be repeated.  As the green  dashed line in figure 4 illustrates, if  the average 
change in consumer prices each month is calculated excluding items whose price changes 
are outlie rs on both the high and low side, the resulting “trimmed mean” measure of 
inflation shows less of a slowdown this year .5   
Based on analyses of this sort, my colleagues and I currently think that this year’s 
low inflation is probably temporary, so we conti nue to anticipate that inflation is likely to 
stabilize around 2 percent over the next few years.  But our understanding of the forces 
driving inflation is imperfect, and we recognize that something more persistent may be 
responsible for the current unders hooting of our longer -run objective.  Accordingly, we 
will monitor incoming data closely and stand ready to modify our views based on what 
we learn.  
Uncertainty about the I nflation Outlook  
Although we judge that inflation will  most likely stabilize aroun d 2 percent over 
the next few years, the odds that it could turn out to be noticeably different are 
considerable.  This point is illustrated by f igure 5.  Here the red line indicates the median 
                                                 
4 In the  simple model, inflation depends in part on lagged inflation.  As a result, an unexplained movement 
in inflation is predicted to influence inflation beyond the current quarter, but to a degree that fades over 
time.  On  average, the model predicts that roug hly 85 percent of any unexplained movement will have 
disappeared after four quarters.  
5 In general, price changes measured over a few months tend to be noisy, even when measured on a core or 
trimmed -mean basis .  For this reason, the FOMC usually focuses on the growth rate of PCE prices over the 
previous 12 months, which smooths through the vola tility in the monthly price data.  This approach also 
sidesteps distortions in the monthly data associated with residual  seasonality; these distortions are likely to 
hold down month -to-month changes in prices over the balance of the year (see Peneva, 2014).  That said, 
12-month rates of inflation will continue to be held down through early 2018 by the unusually weak 
monthly  readings on price changes recorded in early 2017.    - 5 - 
of the latest inflation projections submitted by FOMC participants that I showed 
previously.  The pertinent feature of this figure is the blue shaded region around the red 
line, which shows a 70 percent confidence interval around FOMC participants’ median 
outlook.  T he width of this region reflects the average accuracy of inflation projections 
made by private and government forecasters over the past 20 years.  As the figure shows, 
based on that history, there is a 30 percent probability that inflation could  be greater than 
3 percent or less than 1 percent next year .6   
Most of this uncertainty reflects the influence of unexpected movements in oil 
prices and the foreign exchange value of the dollar , as well as that of idiosyncratic 
developments unrelated to broader economic conditions.  These factors could easily push 
overall inflation noticeably above or below 2 perce nt for a time.  But such disturbances 
are not a great concern from a policy perspe ctive because their effects fade away as long 
as inflation expectations remain anchored.7  For this reason, the FOMC strives to look 
through these transitory inflation effects when setting monetary policy.  Such was the 
case when rising oil prices pushed headline inflation noticeably above 2 percent for 
several years prior to the financial crisis .  Similarly, the Committee substantially 
discounted the reductions in inflation that occurred from 2014 through 2016 as a result of 
the decline in oil prices and the effects of the dollar’s appreciation on import prices . 
A mo re important issue from a policy standpoint  is that some key assumptions 
underlying the baseline outlook could be wrong in ways that imply that inflation will 
remain low for longer than currently projected.  For example, labor market conditions 
                                                 
6 See Reifschneider and Tulip (2017) for details on the calculation of these confidence intervals.

may not be as tight as they appear to be, and thus they may exert less upward pressure on 
inflation than anticipated.  Alternatively, long -run inflation expectations , which have an 
important influence on actual inflation, may not be consistent with the FOMC’s 2 perce nt 
goal.  More broadly, the conventional framework for understanding inflation dynamics 
could be misspecified in some fundamental way.  Let’s now consider each of these 
possibilities in turn.   
Resource U tilization  
The unemployment rate consistent with long -run price stability at any time is not 
known with certainty; we can only estimate it.  The median of the longer -run 
unemployment rate projections submitted by FOMC pa rticipants last week is around 
4-1/2 percent .  But the long- run sustainable unemployment  rate can drift over time 
because of demographic changes and other factors, some of which can be difficult to 
quantify--or even identify --in real time.8  For these and other reasons, the statistical 
precision of such estimates is limited, and the actual  value of the sustainable rate could 
well be noticeably lower than currently projected.9  Thus, although FOMC participants 
generally view current labor utilization as probably somewhat greater than what can be 
sustained in the longer run, the statistical evidence from past experience does not rule out 
                                                 
8 For example, Aaronson and others (2015) estimate that increases in the average age  and educational 
attainment  of U.S. workers will reduce the sustainable rate of unemployment almost 1/2 percentage point 
between 2014 and 2020.  Barnichon and Mesters (2017) also present evidence that demographic changes 
have somewhat reduced the structural unemployment rate in the United States in recent years.   Relatedly, 
Yoon, Kim, and Lee (2014) and Juselius and Takats (20 15) estimate that ongoing demographic transitions 
are having modest disinflationary effects in the United States and other developed economies.  
9 The statistical evidence also suggests that the sustainable rate of unemployment could be higher.  As 
illustra ted by the results reported in Reifschneider, Wascher, and Wilcox (2015) and Barnichon and 
Matthes (2017), standard errors for estimates of the sustainable rate of unemployment are typically at least 
1/2 percentage point.  Accordingly, if the sustainable r ate is estimated to be about 4 -1/2 percent, there is 
roughly a 15 percent probability that the actual value is less than 4 percent; symmetrically, there is a 
15 percent probability that it is greater than 5 percent.   - 7 - 
the possibility that some slack still remains in the labor market.  If so, the economy could 
sustain a higher level of employment and output in the longer run than now anticipated--a 
very beneficial outcome, a lbeit one that would require recalibrating monetary policy over 
time in order to reap those benefits and compensate for the accompanying reduction in 
inflationary pressures.  
A related question is whether the unemployment rate alone is an adequate gauge 
of economic slack for the purposes of explaining inflation.  Although the unemployment 
rate is probably the best single summary measure of labor utilization, some indicators 
have shown less improvement since the financial crisis.10  As the solid blue line in figure 
6 illustrates,  the employed share of the “prime -age worker” population-- that is, persons 
from age s 25 to 54-- remains noticeably below the 2007 level.11  But employment rates 
for this group may now be permanently lower than in the past as a result of declining 
employment opportunities for less -skilled workers, a rising number of people receiving 
disability  insurance, and other worrisome  trends.12  Similarly, although the share of part -
time workers who would like a full -time job is still somewhat above wh ere it stood 
                                                 
10 Several years ago, I discussed the int erpretation of a wide range of labor market indicators at length 
(Yellen, 2014).  
11 The employment -to-population ratio for all persons aged 16 and over has recovered much less than the 
prime -age ratio since 2007, in large part reflecting the ongoing retirem ent of the baby boomers and a rise in 
school attendance rates for young adults aged 20 to 24 (Aaronson and others, 2014).  Schanzenbach and 
others (2017) estimate that the substantial overall employment -to-population gap that opened up in the 
wake of the f inancial crisis finally closed in July 2017.  
12 The labor for ce participation rate for prime -age men has been declining for decades.   Evidence suggests 
that a portion of the decline is attributable to a reduction in the demand for low -skilled workers result ing 
from advances in technology and globalization .  For a general discussion of the decline in male labor force 
participation , see Aaronson and others ( 2014 ).  For a discussion of the role played by technical factors in 
this decline, see Deming  (forthcomin g) and Acemoglu and Autor (2011 ); for a discussion of the role  of 
globalization, see Autor, Dorn, and Hanson (2013 ) and Pierce and Schott  (2016).  In addition to these 
factors, Autor and Duggan (2003) and French and Song (2014) present evidence suggesting that increases 
in the number of people on disability rolls have also been important.  Relatedly, an alarming  deterioration 
in health outcomes  among low -education workers , including a rise in deaths related to alcohol, drugs, and 
suicide , may be having an a dverse effect on both male and female employment (Case and Deaton, 2017).     - 8 - 
before the last two recessions (the dashed red line) , it could reflect a structural change in 
firms’ reliance on part -time labor.13  In addition, these two measures have to be weighed 
against other labor indicators that have either returned to,  or are currently above, their 
pre-recession levels.  As shown in f igure 7, those indicators include the quits rate (the 
short -dashed blue line), household perceptions of job availability (the short -and-long-
dashed green line), the jobs opening rate (the l ong-dashed red line), and the percentage of 
small firms finding it hard to fill jobs (the solid black line).   
On balance, the unemployment rate probably is correct in signaling that overall 
labor market conditions have returned to pre -crisis levels.  But that return does not 
necessarily demonstrate that the economy is now at maximum employment because, due 
to demographic and other structural changes, the unemployment rate that is sustainable 
today may be lower than the rate that was sustainable in the past .   
In that regard, s ome o bservers have pointed to the  continued subdued pace of 
wage growth as evidence that the economy is not yet back to full employment.  As shown 
in figure 8, labor compensation as measured by the e mployment c ost index (the short -
dashed red line) has been growing at more or less the same rate since 2014, and hourly 
compensation in the nonfarm business sector (the short -and-long-dashed green line) --a 
quite noisy measure, even after smoothing-- is actually growing more slowly.  But growth 
in average hourly earnings (the solid blue line) and the Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth 
Tracker (the long- dashed black line) have clearly picked up.14  In addition, productivity 
                                                 
13 For a discussion of how secular forces may be influencing the trend share of part -time employment, see 
Valletta and van der List (2015).   
14 In contrast to the other wage and compensation measures, the Wage Growth Tracker only measures wage 
changes for individuals who had a job in both the current month and a year ago.   - 9 - 
growth has been quite weak in recent years, and empirical analysis sugges ts that it is has 
been holding down aggregate growth in labor compensation independent of labor 
utilization in recent years.15  An analysis of the pattern of wage growth at the U.S. state 
level also suggests that subdued growth for the country as a whole pr obably reflects 
sluggish productivity or some other factor common to all states, because cross- state 
differences in wage growth are about what one would expect given cross -state differences 
in unemployment rates.16  Finally, I would note that the percentage  of firms planning 
wage increases has moved back up to its pre- recession level, many firms report  
difficulties in finding qualified workers, and some have r esponded by expanding training 
programs and offering signing bonuses --possible  harbi ngers of stronge r wage gains 
to come .   
Overall , I view the data we have in hand as suggest ing a generally healthy labor 
market , not one in which substantial slack remains or one that is overheated.  That said, 
the evidence does not allow for any definitive assessment, so  policymakers must remain  
open minded on this question and its implications for reaching our inflation goal.  
Inflation Expectations  
Another source of uncertainty concerns inflation expectations.  In standard 
economic models, inflation expectations are an important determinant of actual inflation 
because, in deciding how much to adjust wages for individual jobs and prices of goods 
                                                 
15 For example, predictions from a simple empirical model track recent movem ents in the employment cost 
index reasonably well, because the model estimates that the increasing upward pressure on compensation 
growth from rising labor utilization is being offset by a declining contribution from productivity growth.  
(See the appendix for further details.)  Relatedly, research also suggests that cyclical changes in the 
composition of the workforce associated with the absorption of new workers with relatively low skills and 
experience may be  currently restraining growth in both aggregat e wages and productivity. See Daly and 
Hobijn (2017) and Daly, Hobijn, and Pyle (2016), who  also point to the retirement  of baby boomers as a 
factor holding down wage growth.  
16 See J.P. Morgan (2017) for more on this analysis.    - 10 - 
and s ervices at a particular time, firms take into account the rate of overall inflation they 
expect to prevail in the future.  Monetary policy presumably plays a key role in shaping 
these expectations by influencing the average rate of inflation experienced in the past 
over long periods of time, as well as by providing guidance about the FOMC’s objectives 
for inflation in the future.  Even so, economists’ understanding of exactly how and why 
inflation expectations change over time is limited.17  Moreover, we have to contend with 
the fact that we do not directly observe the inflation expectations relevant to wage and 
price setting .  Instead, we can only imperfectly infer how they might have changed based 
on survey responses and other data.  
The FOMC’s outlook depends importantly on the view that longer -run inflation 
expectations have been stable for many years at a level consistent with PCE price 
inflation that will average around 2 percent in the longer run .  Provided this stability 
continues, standard models sugge st that actual inflation should stabilize at about 
2 percent over the next two or three years in an environment of roughly full employment, 
absent any future shocks.  However, there is a risk that inflation expectations may not be 
as well anchored as they appear and perhaps are not consistent with our 2 percent goal .  
To assess this risk, the FOMC con siders a variety of survey me asures of expected longer -
run inflation, some of which are shown in f igure 9.  Long- range projections of PCE price 
inflation made by private forecasters, the solid red line, have been remarkably stable for 
many years, as have been the longer -run inflation expectations reported in surveys of 
                                                 
17 As I discussed in a speech one year ago, I view expectations formation as one of the key areas requiring 
further research by economists (see Yellen, 2016).   - 11 - 
financial market participants (not shown).18  Households’ longer -term expectations as 
reported in the University of Michigan S urveys of Consumers , the short -dashed blue line, 
have also been fairly stable overall since the late 1990s.19  That said, results from this 
survey, as well as a survey of consumers carried out by the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
York, do hint that expectations may have slipped a bit over the past two or three years.  If 
so, stabilizing inflation at around 2 percent could prove to be more difficult than 
expected.20 
In theory, differences between yields on conventional Treasury sec urities and 
those on Treasury I nflation -Protected S ecurities (TIP S) are also informative about 
inflation expectations in that they measure the compensation received by investors for 
exposing themselves to future changes in consumer prices.  As indicated by  the long -
dashed green line, TIPS inflation compensation for the five-year period starting five years 
from now has fallen roughly 1 percentage point over the past three years.  This decline 
                                                 
18 In the Survey of Primary Dealers conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the median of  
respondents’ longer -term projections for PCE inflation have been essentially flat at 2 percent since the 
survey began in 2011.  Similarly, in the Blue Chip Financial Indicators survey, which solicits the views of a 
large number of financial firms  (as well  as a few other institutions) about the extended outlook every June 
and December, the median of long -run expectations for GDP price inflation has stayed close to 2.1  percent 
over the past six years.  Comparisons of results from these surveys to those repor ted in the Survey of 
Professional Forecasters (as well as surveys of households) are somewhat complicated by differences in the 
projection period used.  For example, some surveys include the low rates of inflation expected over the next 
few years in the calculation of projected longer -run averages, while other surveys exclude them.  
19 Expected inflation over the next 5 to 10 years as reported in the Michigan survey runs appreciably above 
PCE price inflation on average since the mid -1990s, perhaps because hou seholds are less informed about 
actual inflation developments than professional forecasters and financial firms.  For this reason, it may be 
best to focus on changes over time in the Michigan measure, not on the level.   
20 In addition to monitoring survey measures of expected inflation, Federal Reserve staff also use statistical 
techniques to try to directly estimate possible movements over time in the underlying long- run trend in 
inflation, using data for actual inflation and other series, including resour ce utilization.  Many of these 
statistical estimates suggest that the underlying trend in PCE inflation is currently somewhat below 
2 percent.  Econometrically, however, it is extremely difficult if not impossible to disentangle estimates of 
the underlying  trend in PCE inflation from estimates of the sustainable rate of unemployment.  To be 
consistent with the data, the higher one’s estimate of trend inflation or expected long -run inflation, the 
lower must be one’s estimate of the sustainable unemployment r ate, at least over the medium run.   - 12 - 
could be interpreted as a significant drop in market participants’ expectations for the most  
likely outcome for inflation in the longer run .  However, research suggests that the fall in 
TIPS inflation compensation instead primarily reflects a decline in inflation risk 
premiums and differences in the liquidity of nominal and indexed Treasury securities.21  
This research notwithstanding, the notable decline in inflation compensation may be a 
sign that longer -term inflation expectations have slipped recently.  
Misspecified I nflation Dynamics  
Another risk is that our framework for understanding inflation dynamics could be 
misspecified in some fundamental way , perhaps becau se our econometric models 
overlook some factor that will restrain inflation in coming years  despite solid labor 
market conditions.  One possibility in this vei n is a continuation of the subdued growth in 
health -care prices that we have seen in recent years-- a sector -specific factor not 
controlled for in standard models .  Because health care accounts for a large share of total 
consumer spending, this slow growth  has restrained overall inflation materially and may 
continue to do so for some time .22  A similar situation occurred during the 1990s, when a 
significant shift in health insurance enrollment away from fee -for-service and toward 
HMO (that is, Health Maintena nce Organization) plans reduced cost pressures and held 
                                                 
21 For example, Andreasen and Christensen (2016) show that once TIPS liquidity premium s are taken into 
account, the model -implied one -year inflation expectation becomes more stable and shows a smaller 
decline since 2013.  In addition, quotes on inflation derivatives suggest that most of the decline in inflation 
compensation over this period is associated with investor perceptions of reduced risks of above -target 
inflation outcomes rather than increased risks of below -target  inflation outcomes.  
22 Personal consumption expenditures include all medical services, including those paid by Medicare and 
Medicaid; prices for the latter may be viewed as “administered” because they are essentially set by the 
government.  The formulas us ed to set Medicare prices were adjusted by the 2010 Affordable Care Act and 
additional legislation passed in 2015, resulting in smaller increases in prices for the same increase in costs 
than would have been the case in the prior decade.  In addition, Medi caid prices have probably been 
restrained somewhat by budget pressures on state governments.  Aside from these direct influences of 
government policy on healthcare prices, some research suggests that lower Medicare prices tend to lead to 
lower negotiated p rices by private insurers as well (see Clemens, Gottlieb, and Shapiro, 2016).    - 13 - 
down overall inflation for several years.  If these sorts of favorable supply- type shocks  
continue, achieving our 2 percent inflation goal over the medium term may require a 
more accommodative  stance of monetary policy than might otherwise be appropriate.  
Some commentators have conjectured that, because of rising trade volumes and 
the integration of production chains across countries, U.S. inflation now depends on 
global resource utilization, not just  on conditions here at home  and those effects arising 
through movements in energy and import prices .  However, studies of this issue do not, 
on balance, provide much empirical support for this possibility.23  Moreover, foreign 
economic growth has firmed thi s year and the global economy appears to have largely 
recovered, so any influence that global resource utilization might have on U.S. inflation 
would presumably be small.  Nevertheless, increased competition from the integration of 
China and other emerging market countries into the world economy may have materially 
restrained price margins and labor compensation in the United States and other advanced 
economies.  In fact, one  study concludes that most  of the decline in the labor share of 
national income in the United States since the late 1980s can be attributed to offshoring 
of labor -intensive production.24  If this restraint on the labor share continues to build over 
                                                 
23 In an early study, Borio and Filardo (2007) reported results suggesting that global economic slack adds 
considerable explanatory power to reduced -form inflation equations  (such as the one discussed in the 
appendix) , and that its role has been growing over time.  However, Ihrig, Kamin, Lindner, and Marquez 
(2010) subsequently argued that the estimated link was not robust to alternat ive measures of global 
resource utilization.  Federal Reserve Board staff have updated this a nalysis using data through early 2017 
and confirmed  that global slack does not appear to exert an appreciable direct effect on domestic inflation 
in the United States and most other advanced economie s. 
24 Using  sector -level data, Elsby, Hobijn, and Sahin (2013) estimate the contributions of offshoring, the 
substitution of capital for low -skilled labor, and several other factors on the aggregate U.S. labor share of 
income, and find that only offshoring has been i mportant.  They also conclude that the decline in the labor 
share since the late 1980s has been overstated as a result of statistical measurement problems.  In contrast 
to the influence of globalization on the U.S. labor share, Feenstra and Weinstein (2017 ) find that the 
influence of increased globalization on price markups in the United States has been modest.   - 14 - 
the next few years (and not merely  holds  steady), then it could indirectly hold down the 
growth of domestic wages and prices in ways not captured by conventional models.   
More speculatively, changes in the structure of the domestic economy may also 
be altering inflation dynamics in ways not captured by conventional models.  The 
growing importance of online shopping, by increasing the competitiveness of the U.S. 
retail sector, may have reduced price margins and restrained the ability of firms to raise 
prices in response to rising demand.25  That said, the economy overall appears to have 
become more concentrated and less dynamic in r ecent years, which  may tend to increase  
firms’ pricing power.26  Because these changes occur  slow ly, determining their complex 
effects on the economy will, as a pra ctical matter, require studying data over a 
considerable time.   
Finally, I would note the possibility that inflation may rise more sharply in 
response to robust labor market conditions than anticipated.  The influence of labor 
utilization on inflation has  become quite modest over the past 20 years, implying that the 
inflationary consequences of misjudging the sustainable rate of unemployment are low.  
But we cannot be sure that this modest sensitivity will persist in the face of strong labor 
market conditi ons, given that we do not fully understand how it came to be so modest in 
the first place.  Although the evidence is weak that inflation responds in a nonlinear 
manner to resource utilization, this risk is one that we cannot entirely dismiss.

Economic Advisers (2016).  For a discussion of the evidence for, and some of the implications of, changes

Policy I mplic ations  
What are the policy implications of these uncertainties?  For one, my colleagues 
and I must be ready to adjust our assessments of economic conditions and the outlook 
when new data warrant it.  In this spirit, FOMC participants --like private forecast ers--
have reduced their estimates of the sustainable unemployment rate appreciably over the 
past few years in response to the continual flow of information about the always  changing 
economy.27  To the extent these assessments change over time, so too will t he outlook 
and judgments about the appropriate stance of monetary policy.  Importantly, even if 
resource utilization is currently lower than we estimate or if longer- run in flation 
expectations are running at level s consistent with longer -run PCE price  inflation  
somewhat below 2 percent , the FOMC can still  achieve its inflation goal.  Under those 
conditions, continuing to revise our assessments in response to incoming data would 
naturally result in a policy path that is somewhat easier than that now anticipa ted--an 
appropriate course correction that would reflect our commitment to maximum 
employment and price stability.  
Similar considerations apply to other important sources of uncertainty, such as the 
value of the neutral real interest rate --that is, the inf lation -adjusted level of t he federal 
funds rate consistent with keeping the economy operating on an even keel.  Estimates of 
this rate have declined considerably in recent years, and, by some estimates, the real 
neutral rate is currently close to zero.  But the neutral rate changes over time as a result of 
the interaction of many forces, including demographics, productivity growth, fiscal 
                                                 
27 The median of FOMC participants’ projections of the longer -run unemployment rate has declined almost 
a full percentage point over the past five years; the revision in the long -run consensus forecast reported in 
the Blue Chip  Survey between October 2012 and March 2017 was slightly larger.   - 16 - 
policy, and the strength of global demand, so its value at any point in time cannot be 
estimated or projected with much precision.  My FOMC colleagues and I will therefore 
need to continue to reassess and revise our assessments of the neutral rate in response to 
incoming data and adjust monetary p olicy accordingly.  
How should policy be formulated in the face of such significant uncertainties?  In 
my view, it strengthens the case for a gradual pace of adjustments.  Moving too quickly 
risks overadjusting policy to head off projected developments tha t may not come to pass.  
A gradual approach is particul arly appropriate in light of subdued inflation and a low 
neutral real interest rate, which imply that the FOMC will have only limited scope to cut 
the federal funds rate should the economy be hit with an adverse shock .28  But we should 
also be wary of moving too gradually.  Job gains continue to run well ahead of the 
longer -run pace we estimate would be sufficient, on average, to provide jobs for new 
entrants to the labor force.  Thus, without further modest increases in the federal funds 
rate over time, there is a risk that the labor market could eventually become overheated, 
potentially creating an inflationary problem down the road that might be difficult to 
overcome without triggering a recession.  Pe rsistently easy monetary policy might also 
eventually lead to increased leverage and other developments , with adverse implications 
for financial stability.  For these reasons, and given that monetary policy affects 
economic activity and inflation with a substantial lag, it would be imprudent to keep 
monetary policy on hold until inflation is back to 2 percent.   
                                                 
28 It might be thought that the FOMC could mitigate this problem by raising the federal funds rate higher 
than might otherwise be called for while the economy continues to expand in order to increase the extent to 
which interest rates could be cut later should a recession occur.  But this strategy would be 
counterproductive, because it would only serve to weaken economic activity and push down inflation 
before the recession.   - 17 - 
Conclusion 
To conclude, standard empirical analyses support the FOMC’s outlook that, with 
gradual adjustments in monetary policy, inflation will st abilize at around the FOMC’s 
2 percent objective over the next few years, accompanied by some further strengthening 
in labor market conditions.  But the outlook is uncertain, reflecting, among other things , 
the inherent imprecision in our estimates of labo r utilization, inflation expectations, and 
other factors.  As a result, we will need to carefully monitor the incoming data and, as 
warranted, adjust our assessments of the outlook and the appropriate stance of monetary 
policy.  But in making these adjustm ents, our longer -run objectives will remain 
unchanged--to promote maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.

Appendix:  PCE Inflation Model, Inflation Decomposition Procedure , and the ECI 
Growth Equation  
PCE Inflation Model  
The inflation model used in the decomposition procedure includes two equations :  
an identity for the change in the price index for total personal consumption expenditures 
(PCE) and a simple reduced -form forecasting equation for core PCE  price  inflation .  The 
identity is   
𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡=𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐+𝜔𝜔𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡+𝜔𝜔𝑡𝑡𝑓𝑓𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡, 
where 𝜋𝜋 𝑡𝑡 and 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐 denote growth rates (expressed as annualized log differences) of total 
and core PCE prices, respectively .  𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 and 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 𝑡𝑡 are annualized growth rates for 
prices of consumer energy goods and services and prices of food and beverages, both 
expressed relative to core PCE prices, and 𝜔𝜔𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒 and 𝜔𝜔𝑡𝑡𝑓𝑓are the weights of energy and food 
in total consumption.  The core inflation forecasting equation is  
𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐=.41𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒+.36𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−1𝑐𝑐+.23𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−2𝑐𝑐−.08𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 𝑡𝑡+.56𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 𝑡𝑡+𝜖𝜖𝑡𝑡, 
where 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒 is expected long -run inflation ; 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 𝑡𝑡 denotes the level of resource utilization, 
𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 controls for the effect of changes in the relativ e price of core imported goods, 𝜖𝜖 𝑡𝑡 
is a white- noise error t erm, and the coefficients are ordinary least squares estimates 
obtained using data from 1990:Q1 to 2014:Q4.29 
For estimation purposes, 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 𝑡𝑡 is approximated using the unemployment rate

29 Although the dat a used in the decomposition analysis have been revised and extended, the specification 
of the model and the estimation period are the same as that discussed in a speech I gave two years ago 
(Yellen, 2015).  As a result, the estimated coefficients of the mo del are essentially unchanged.  Extending 
the estimation period through 2017:Q2 has little effect on the estimated coefficients and the decomposition

run PCE price inflation reporte d in the Survey of Professional Forecasters; from 1991:Q4 
to 2006:Q4, the series is base d on the median long-run forecast s of inflation as measured 
by the consumer price index (CPI), l ess a constant adjustment o f 40 basis points to put 
the CPI forecasts on a PCE basis; before 1991:Q4, ߨ௧௘ is approximated by the long-run 
inflation expectations reported in the Hoey survey.  The relati ve import price term, 
ܯܫܴܲ௧, is defined as the annualized gr owth rate of the price index f or core imported 
goods (defined to exclude petroleu m, natural gas, computers, an d semiconductors) less 
the lagged four-quarter change  in core PCE inflation, all multi plied by the share of 
nominal core imported goods in nominal GDP.30 
Inflation Decomposition Procedure 
To decompose recent movements in inflation into its various com ponents, the 
series used in the inflation mode l--for which complete quarterl y data are available only 
through 2017:Q2 in most cases--ar e first extended through the e nd of 2017.  In the case 
of inflation, the extensions are  consistent with the medians of  Federal Open Market 
Committee (FOMC) participants’ pr ojections for total and core P CE inflation in 2017 that 
were reported at the press conf erence following the September 2 017 FOMC meeting.31  
Similarly, ܭܥܣܮܵ ௧ over the second half of 2017 is de fined to be consistent with the 
median of FOMC projections for t he 2017:Q4 unemployment rate le ss the CBO’s 
estimates of the historical pat h of the long-run natural rate.  The CBO’s 2017 estimate is 
slightly higher than the media n of FOMC participants’ most rece nt projections of the 
                                                 
30 This measure of core import prices is constructed by Board sta ff using published and unpublished data 
provided by the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Bureau of L abor Statistics. 
31 The information on participants ’ forecasts provided at the Sep tember 20, 2017, pr ess conference is 
available on the Board’s website at 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/m onetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtab l20170920.pdf .  - 20 - 
normal longer -run level of t he unemployment  rate.  For changes in the price of core 
imports, t he 2017:H2 extrapolations are based on a regression of th is series on current 
and lagged changes in exchange rates.  This approach predicts that core import prices 
should rise about 4- 1/2 pe rcent at an annual rate in the second half of this year.32  Energy 
and f ood prices over the second half of 2017 are assumed to  rise at annual rates of 
10 percent and 1.6 percent, respectively; these  assumptions (which  take into account 
published monthly PCE  data through July and published CPI data through August, as 
well as recent movements in gasoline prices in the wake of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma) 
ensure that the combined contribution of food and energy prices to inflation in 2017 is 
consistent with the median difference between FOMC participants’  projections for total 
and core inflation.  Finally, nominal spending shares for food, energy, and core imports 
are assumed t o remain unchanged at their 2017:Q2 levels, and long- run inflation 
expectations are assumed to remain constant at 2  percent.  
After computing historical 𝜖𝜖𝑡𝑡 tracking errors for the two equations of the model, 
the final step in the decomposition procedure is to run a sequence of counterfactual 
simulations of the  model from 1990:Q1 through 2017:Q4.  One by one, each explanatory 
variable of the model is set to zero , and the model is simulated; the resulting difference 
between actual inflation and its simulated value equals the historical contribution of that 
                                                 
32 The level of core import prices, expressed relative to core consumer prices, displayed a modest 
downward trend from 1990 through 2001 but since then has displayed little persistent trend, particularly if 
one controls for shifts related to recent changes in the real exchange rate.  If the post -2001 pattern persists 
in coming years, then 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 would be expected to converge to zero within a few quarters and core PCE 
inflation to converge to 2 percent within two or three years, assuming that the unem ployment rate remains 
near 4 -1/2 percent (the median of the longer -run projections provided by FOMC participants) and there are 
no further shocks to the exchange rate and other factors.  If, however, core import prices were expected to 
resume trending down relative to consumer prices, then the model as specified would imply that the 
unemployment rate consistent wit h inflation stabilizing at 2 percent in the longer run  would be somewhat 
lower than 4- 1/2 percent.   - 21 - 
particular factor.  Importantly, the simulations are all dynamic in that the lagged inflation 
term in the core inflation equation is set equal to its simulated value in the preceding 
period rather than its actual value.  As a result, the decompositions incorporate the effects 
of changes in la gged inflation that are attributable to previous movements in the 
explanatory variables.  
ECI G rowth E quation 
The estimated equation for the e mployment c ost index (ECI) is:  
𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑤𝑤=−0.72+.58𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−1𝑒𝑒+.10𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−1𝑤𝑤+.12𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−2𝑤𝑤+.10𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−3𝑤𝑤+.11𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−4𝑤𝑤−.19𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 𝑡𝑡−
.57∆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 𝑡𝑡+.58𝑅𝑅𝑆𝑆 _𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡+𝜀𝜀𝑡𝑡, 
where 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑤𝑤 is the annualized log difference of the ECI for hourly compensation of private 
industry workers , 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒 and 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 𝑡𝑡 have the same definition as the corresponding variables 
from the PC E price inflation model , ∆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 𝑡𝑡 denotes the first difference of 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 𝑡𝑡, 
𝑅𝑅𝑆𝑆_𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡 is a moving average of an estimate of trend productivity growth for the 
business sector , and 𝜀𝜀𝑡𝑡 is an  error term.33  The coefficients are obtained from a restricted 
least squares regression using quarterly data from 1988:Q1 to 2017:Q2.34  Trend 
productivity growth is estimated as the low -frequency component of the annualized log 
difference of business- sector output per hour from the B ureau of L abor S tatistic s 
Productivity and Costs report.35  The moving average of trend productivity growth 
                                                 
33 The ECI series used here is obtained from a ratio splice of the SIC - and NAICS -based indexes; the SIC -
based index is used before 2001 and the NAICS -based i ndex used thereafter.  ( All data used in the model 
were current as of September  1, 2017.)   
34 The estimation procedure imposes the joint restriction that the sum of the coefficients on 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−1𝑒𝑒 and the 
lagged ECI growth terms are equal to 1, and that the c oefficients on 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−1𝑒𝑒 and 𝑅𝑅𝑆𝑆_𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 𝑡𝑡 are equal.  This 
joint restriction receives a p value  of 0.57.  
35 The low-pass component is obtained from a band -pass filter.  The filter width and cutoffs are set equal to 
the values used in Douglas Staiger, James Stock, and Mark Watson (2001), “Prices, Wages, and the U.S. 
NAIRU in the 1990s,” in Alan Krueger and Robert Solow, eds., The Roaring Nineties:  Can Full 
Employment Be Sustained? (New York:  Russell Sage Foundation and Century Foundation Press), pp.  3-60.   - 22 - 
(which is used in the estimation) is computed as a geometrically declining weighted 
average,  
𝑅𝑅𝑆𝑆_𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡=0.95𝑅𝑅𝑆𝑆 _𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡−1+0.05𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 𝑡𝑡, 
where 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 𝑡𝑡 denotes t rend productivity growth and where the moving average is 
initialized in 1955:Q1 with that quarter’s estimate of the trend growth rate.  
The model is used to compute a decomposition of ECI growth following a 
procedure similar to  that used to construct the de composition for core PCE price 
inflation.  The table summarizes the results of this decomposition over various periods; 
note that the column labeled “ Slack” combines the effects of ∆ 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 𝑡𝑡 and 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 𝑡𝑡, the 
effect of the model’s constant term is included in the column labeled “ Trend 
productivity,” and the column labeled “ Other” gives the contributions of the model’s 
tracking errors.

model;  after its 2017:Q2 endpoint, the series is padded with the CBO’s January 2017 forecast of average 
nonfarm business trend productivity growth from 2017 to 2027 (which is 1.67  percent in log differences) 
and with the 2027 value of the CBO forecast (1.77  percent) thereafter.   - 23 -

Thank you, it is a pleasure to join you virtually today and share a few thoughts on 
what I am hearing from community banks in the wake of the pandemic, and what the 
Federal Reserve is doing to assist in the recovery .   
When I  addressed this conference exactly a year ago, the world was a very 
different place.  COVID -19 has brought hardship and disruption to nearly every aspect of 
our lives, and even as economic conditions improve, the pandemic continues to weigh on households, businesses, and the economy.  Today, I  would like  to offer  some of my 
observations on current conditions and share with you what I have learned in  discussions 
with community bankers across the nation.  This input has s haped my views of how 
supervision and regulation are affecting community banks in these challenging times —
what is working, and what needs to improve.  In addition to the Fed’s usual consultation with community banks, I have separately embarked on an effort to meet directly with the 
CEOs of all 6 85 community banks supe rvised by the Fed, a n undertaking that has already 
provided valuable insights that I will rela te in these remarks.  
What Community Banks H ave Achieved  
 America has never experienced a health and economic crisis like the one we are 
facin g.  The measures taken to contain the virus and the ensuing sudden stop to the 
economy beginning in March were unprecedented, just  as some aspects of the downturn.  
One of these is the extent to which small businesses have been affected.  Small businesses tend to be service -oriented  and clustered in retail and food services, with many 
less able than larger companies  to maintain operations via remote work.  Because 
community banks are a major  source of credit and financial services for small businesses, 
this crisis has had a hea vy impact on their customer s, and in their communities.       - 2 - 
  Another unusual aspect of this event, which I have noted before, is the geographic 
variation in the timing and severity of the pandemic’s effect .1  Given the  widely varying 
rates of infection , and the distinct approaches of states and localities in  dealing with the 
virus , we are seeing divergent experiences in economic performance in different areas of 
the country.   
As a result, and to a greater extent than in the past, this slowdown  is being felt 
differently  from  community to community, and is being responded to differently from 
community to community.  So it is no surprise that community banks are standing 
shoulder to shoulder with their customers, on the front lines. You have done this befor e, 
of course, during past recessions, but for the reasons I’ve outlined, your role this time has never been more critical.  That is why one of the government’s first responses  to the 
pandemic was the Paycheck Protection Program  (PPP) , geared to small business, and 
necessarily dependent on community banks.  So let me start there, and review what has 
been accomplished through PPP and discuss the role of community banks in that program . 
Based on preliminary results, it appears PPP was ti mely  and effective in helping 
millions of businesses weather the lockdown period.  It was also  designed in a way that 
made community banks integral to its success.  The first funds reached busin esses 
roughly three  weeks after the need for that relief was recognized.  To provide perspective, 
$525 billion, or roughly 19 times the value of all Small Business Administration lending

Association CEO and Senior Management Forum/Annual Meeting, Topeka, Kansas (via webcast) , August

in fiscal year 2019, was distributed in the four months from April through August 8.2,3  
Community banks with $10 billion or less i n assets made about 40 percent of the overall 
number and value of PPP loans.4  Community banks were absolutely essential  to the 
success of this program .   
This outcome is probably not surprising to this audience , because when it comes 
to lending to small businesses, community banks have always been  an outsized source of 
credit, relative to their size in the banking system.  B efore the pandemic , community 
banks accounted for over 40 percent of all small  business lending, while they only 
accounted for roughl y 15 percent of total assets in the banking system .  
Community banks  know their individual and small business customers, and they 
know their communities.  In my conversations with community bank CEOs, s everal 
reported to me that early in the pandemic they directly contacted every single one of their 
business and consumer loan customer s, taking the time to  check in with each one to see 
how they were  doing, and what they needed .  They encourage d customers to keep in 
touch with the bank, and they note d the available opportunities for payment deferrals that 
customers might not have be en aware of.  The y asked , “Do you need us and how can we 
help?”   In this pande mic, it means going further,  than other banks could or would. 
According to the 2020 n ational s urvey conducted by the Conference of State Bank 
Supervisors, more than one -third of community banks reduced or eliminated penalties or

fees on credit cards, loans, or deposits.5  One banker in Colorado told me that his bank 
called 3,700 individual borrowers of fering deferrals —and that 2,000 of them accepted.  
 Let me highlight the role of smaller community banks in the PPP, because they 
demonstrate the agility and close relationships with customers that was so importa nt in 
connecting with the businesses most threatened by the lockdowns.  Banks with less than 
$1 billion in assets have made a million loans under the PPP , about one -fifth the total, 
delivering $85 billion in relief to their customers.6  Additionally, as shown in figure  1, the 
smallest banks made t he smallest PPP loans on average, illustrating that these banks play 
a key role in serving businesses that may be outside the focus of larger banks.  The 
average PPP loan size at banks with total assets under $500 million was just $72,000, about half  the s ize of  the average loan at banks with total assets between $10 billion and 
$100 billion.  
Additionally, preliminary data based on an Independent Community Bankers of 
America report indicates that c ommunity banks have been the main source of lending for 
minority -owned small businesses during the pandemic , accounting for 73 percent of all 
PPP loans made to small businesses owned by non- whites .  Early estimates also suggest 
that community banks provided 64 percent of PPP loans to  major ity veteran -owned 
businesses.
7   Within the broader community banking sector, there are banks that  have the 
mission to serve low -income and minority communities.  Specifically, I am referring to 
minority depository institutions (MDIs) and c ommunity development f inancial

institutions (CDFIs).  These institutions had previously established relationships with 
minority and low -income small business owners and were quickly able to provide  them 
access to PPP loans.  Additionally, as trusted institutions in the ir communities, new 
businesses sought them out as lenders who understood their unique, and sometimes 
challenging, business needs.  The Cleveland Fed recently published an article entitled “I 
can’t believe I got a real person,” which describes one minority -owned small business’s 
experience successfully getting a PPP loan from an MDI in Los Angeles.8  The title alone 
captures why community banks were so important for small businesses seeking PPP loans —small banks offer a personalized level of customer service th at big banks do not .  
It is also striking that smaller community banks were the predominant lenders despite 
having a smaller staff  and while  facing lobby closures and other workforce challenges 
due to COVID -19.  Several of the bankers I spoke with  worked from home , when they 
couldn’t open their banks .  They worked overtime in drive -through facilities. They 
worked, in one case, inside a makeshift “disaster recovery site.”  Through  all the ups  and 
downs and closures and reopenings , they persevered.  “We closed lobbies,” a banker 
from Nebraska told me, “ but we never closed the bank.”  
Actions  like these highlight the importance and value of relationship banking, 
which is so central to the mission of community banks.  According to the Call Report data, community banks held roughly $400 billion in small business loans in June  2020, as 
shown in figure 2.  Loans made under the PPP totaled $197 billion —an amount 
representing about  40 percent  of all funding provided under this program.  A banker from

Virginia told me , “It was a great opportunity for the community banks to show their 
strength.”  
The Federal Reserve’s Small Business Credit Survey shows that over one -third of 
small businesses turn to small banks for their lending needs.9  The survey data indicate 
that th ese borrowers are far more satisfied with their banks than the businesses who 
borrowed from other sources, and three out of five small businesses cite an existing 
relationship as a key reason they continue to do business with their bank.  The PPP program strengthened many preexisting relationships between community banks and 
their borrowers, but community banks also met the needs of new customers facing stress from C OVID- 19.  One bank reported 3,000 new customers from a total of 15,000 PPP 
loan origi nations.  Over time, t he establishment of these new relationships is likely to 
benefit both the community bank and the small businesses they serve.  
Community Bank Supervision d uring the Pandemic  
 Now let me turn to the question of how the Federal Reserve is approaching 
community bank supervision during the pandemic, and how that aligns  with my 
philosophy about how the Fed should always conduct  supervision.  
 As you well know, c ommunity banks form a  critical  part of a strong and stable 
financial system , and they are vital to their surrounding communities .  Supervising 
community banks requires us to strike a delicate balance between ensuring their safety 
and soundness and ensuring that they are able to continue serving th ose vital function s.  
This is esp ecially true now, when community banks are supporting the businesses bearing

the brunt of the economic effects of the pandemic.  This situation strongly argues for 
flexibility in supervision.   
In each of my conversations  with community bank CEOs , I ask wh at they are 
experiencing and what they need, while sharing a  very clear message about the Fed’s 
flexibility:  G iven the challenging environment, the Fed  will take into account good faith 
efforts by banks affected by COVID -19.  In this pandemic , our common goal is to 
support individuals, businesses, and communities.  This approach is reflected in an April 2020 statement issued by the Fed and other bank supervisors.
10  In that statement, we 
instructed b ank examiners not to criticize bank management for taking prudent steps to 
support their communities, and we underscored that we would not expect to take a consumer compliance public enforcement action against an institution that has made 
good faith efforts to comply.  This message has been getting through to examiners.  One community banker in 
Texas that I spoke to recently said he had been feeling the justifiable concern that granting the kind of forbearances that everyone recognizes are essential to keep 
businesses open will eventually come back to haunt him in an examination.  When he 
aired this concern to the Fed, he said he felt “incredible support” when the message he 
received back was, “ Bank your customers.”  This  assistance is helping homeowners.  A 
                                                 
10 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, National 
Credit Union Administration, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and Consumer Financial 
Protection Burea u, “Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions

recent Federal  Reserve survey found that 5 percent of homeowners with a mortgage had  
received a payment deferral  from their lender.11 
So let me extend the same message to others who might be worried: “B ank your 
customers.” 
Now let me tell you how these actions fit into m y overall view of how to conduct 
effective bank supervision.  O ur goal as regulators is to ensure that each institution under 
our supervision is successful in managing the risks present within its operations and 
product offerings.  Effective supervisory pr actices are not static.  They evolve over time 
as lessons are learned.  
That includes learning by supervisors.  As one example, the volume of PPP 
lending has driven meaningful asset growth, especially for smaller banks.  We recognize that for some institutions, this asset growth has caused many  banks to exceed or nearly 
exceed certain asset -based thresholds contained in statutes, regulations, and reporting 
requirements.  We are currently exploring how to address regulatory and supervisory 
challenges caused b y this temporary asset growth.  
Supervis ors encourage  banks to adopt best practices, and I believe that we should 
also seek  to achieve the highest supervisory standards.  First, we should clearly 
communicate our expectations.  It is wasteful, costly , and unnecessary when compliance 
activity occurs because expectations have not been clearly articulated or understood.  
Examiners should always be able and available to explain written guidance.  A second consideration is that communication must also be ti mely.  Supervisors should promptly

communicate the findings of off - and on- site analyses, which will further  improve the 
process of answering questions and addressing issues thereby improving compliance.  A 
third principle is transparency .  The key goal he re is to promote a clear and transparent 
supervisory process so bankers know and understand how we form our expectations and judgments, and that they will receive  this information in a timely manner.  
Overall , I think  it is entirely appropriate to regularly  ask whether our approaches 
to supervision are consistent with the stated policy objectives of efficiency, safety and soundness , and financial stability.  One of those objectives is a healthy community 
banking sector that can continue to serve its customer s.  The pandemic has emphasized  
just how important that is.  
The Leading Challenge for Community Banks  
Another theme  I have heard repeatedly from CEOs is the strong message that they 
are struggling with the cost and burdens of  regulatory compliance .  Many bankers have 
said they consider this the most significant threat to their existence.  According to the 
CSBS National Survey, relative compliance costs actually decreased modestly in 2019, which may be a sign that some of the steps we are taking are helping.  This is consistent with what I heard from one Oklahoma banker , who said the  biggest threat to his long -
term survival was regulatory burden —but “not so much in the last few years.”  
We know examinations are top of mind for every community banker, and we  are 
aware some bankers are also concerned with the length of time associated with the examination process.   Community bank exams generally consist of phases —pre -exam 
contact, scoping, conducting the exam, and, finally, the drafting and delivery of t he 
report.   From a banker’s perspective, the exam begins with the first day letter or perhaps  - 10 - 
the first contact of an examiner with the bank, and ends with receipt of the report of 
exam.   From a banker’s perspective, exams can seem as though they last for many 
months, which can strain resources for community banks that are unable to dedicate staff exclusively to managing the examination process.   This is a valid concern, and a chieving 
an appropriate timeframe for the length of exams, whether that be safety and soundness or consumer compliance, is very important to me.   We are committed to evaluating our 
policies, practices, and implementation processes to understand and identify opportunities to address these concerns.  
There are other significant concerns fo r community bankers, but these only 
compound the challenge posed by regulatory burden.  Bankers worry about competition from larger banks with economies of scale that are sufficient to drive consolidation.  O ne 
of the biggest advantages from scale comes in  regulatory compliance.  As one banker in 
Wyoming told me: “Consolidation is a huge threat as larger banks can deliver at a far  
lower cost.”  One of the biggest costs, of course, is regulatory compliance . Researchers 
from the St. Louis Fed found that compl iance expenses averaged nearly 10 percent of 
total non- interest expenses for banks with less than $100 million in total assets.  For 
banks with between $1 billion and $10 billion in total assets, compliance expenses averaged 5.3 percent of total non -intere st expense.  This suggests that the regulatory cost 
burden for the smallest community banks is nearly double that of the largest community banks. 
In a speech about community banking regulation, it is entirely appropriate to point 
out our work on tailoring efforts .  However, on its own, tailoring does  not ensure that 
existing regulations are not unduly burdensome for smaller banks.  T hese banks may  - 11 - 
benefit from further regulatory relief , without undermining the goals of safety and 
soundness, consumer protection, and financial stability.  R egulatory burden can be 
manifested in multiple ways , including the attitude that examiners have in their 
interactions with banks.  That is why the super vision principles I outlined earlier  are so 
important.  Supervisors need to c ommunicate intentions clearly, in a timely manner, and 
in a transparent  way .  Doing so consistently can significantly lighten the regulatory 
burden that is such a challenge for ba nks.  
Current Economic and Financial Conditions for Banks  
I will conclude with a few comments about economic and financial conditions as 
they affect community banks.  Our nation has suffered the sharpest drop in economic 
activity in U.S. history, and while  unemployment remains quite high, the recent economic 
data have been encouraging and suggest that our national economy has been recovering at a rapid pace.   The substantial  and timely fiscal stimulus provided by Congress and the 
Administration  has made a m eaningful contribution to t his recovery.  Looking ahead, 
continued monetary and targeted  fiscal policy support  will likely be needed .  Even with 
this support, however, I anticipate  that the path to ward full  recovery will be bumpy, and 
that our progress will  likely be uneven.  Asset prices in particular, remain vulnerable to 
significant price declines should the pandemic seriously worsen.  Some hotels and other businesses are in arrears on rent and debt service payments, and we are watching the commercial  real estate market closely for signs of further stress .  I also expect  the pace of 
the recovery will continue  to vary from area to area, and will be heavily influenced by not 
only the course of the virus, but also the public policy  decisions made across a ll levels of 
government.   - 12 - 
Before the COVID- 19 pandemic began, all of the data told us that community 
banks began this year in excellent shape—by some measures the strongest in decades. 
Ninety -six percent of community banks were profitable ; nonperforming as sets neared 
historic al lows, and capital ratios were strong.  More than 95 percent of small ban ks were 
rated as 1 or 2 under the CAMEL S rating system .  These banks built strong capital 
positions and substantially improved asset quality metrics in the years  following the last 
crisis. They also entered the pandemic with high levels of liquidity that have been 
augmented by deposit inflows associated with the pandemic -related stimulus programs. 
Finally, credit concentrations were generally much lower, especiall y in construction and 
commercial real estate, and broadly speaking, concentration risk management practices significantly improved since the financial crisis.  
Following a weak first quarter that included higher credit loss provisions , second-
quarter earnings showed improvement .  Aggregate return on assets recover ed more than 
two-thirds of the decline reported during the first quarter, driven by higher noninterest 
income and lower operating expenses.  Origination fees and interest income from PPP lendi ng fueled some of this improvement, with many community banks reporting 
substantial loan growth as a result of the program, and a few actually doubling their balance sheets.  As seen in figure 3, the quarter -over-quarter loan growth would have 
been negativ e, absent  the PPP loans .  As origination fees and interest income are 
generally recognized over the life of these loans or when they are forgiven, PPP loans will continue to push up bank earnings in the next several quarters.  The origination fees earned b y community banks this year will mitigate the impact of provisions for credit 
losses, and in turn, may support further lending by these banks.   - 13 - 
 Despite improvement in these areas, the operating environment remains  
challenging.  The average net interest margin at community banks tightened  during the 
second quarter, and it is likely that m argins will  remain under pressure given the low 
interest rate environment.  But community banks have historically performed well even 
when interest margins were under press ure, and they entered  into the pandemic in sound 
financial condition.     
So what do we take away from this review of bank numbers and performance?   In 
all, I expect community banks will face challenges during what could be a slow return to 
a full  economic  recovery , but I also expect that this  sector is well prepared to deal with 
these challenges and will continue to perform the vital role it has played during the 
response to the pandemic.  My hope is that at next year’s conference we will have 
additional d ata and research that paint a fuller picture of the role community banks played 
in our nation’s response to and recovery from COVID -19, and that we have gained 
further insights into the role of all community banks, including MDIs and CDFIs, in ensuring acc ess by all t o credit and financial services.

March 24, 2022  
Thank you,  Debra, and thank you to the Alrov Institute and the Ru tgers  Center for 
Real Estate  for the invitation to be part of this conference .  Today, I would like to talk to 
you primarily about developments in the residential real estate  market since the start of 
pandemic  and then look ahead at the  outlook for housing.1  I will consider how rental and 
home prices have increased and how monetary and fiscal policy have affected these 
prices.      
As a member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC),  I watch real estate 
trends pretty closely because they have a bearing on our pursuit of maximum 
employment and price stability.  Real estate makes a sizable contribution to gross 
domestic product , from both housing investment and consumption spending on housing 
services , which is what renters and homeowners pay for the shelter and amenities 
provided by housing .  Real estate also matters for inflation.   Housing services represent 
about 15 percent of the Personal Consumption Expenditure price index , and i t represents 
an even larger share of another well-known inflation yardstick, the Consumer Price 
Index.  Real estate is also a large and broadl y held asset class, so it is important for the 
Federal Reserve’s mission of promoting financial stability.  So, my colleagues and I on 
the Board of Governors and the FOMC share your interest in what is happening  and will 
happen in real estate markets . 
As we all know, a singular feature of the U.S. expansion since the COVID -19 
recession has been the red -hot housing market. Trust me , I know it is red hot  because I 
am trying to buy a house here in Washington and the market is crazy.  Both house prices

and rent s are up significantly across the nation, while  vacancy rates for rented and owner -
occupied homes are down .  
Let’s start with rents, because rents give us the most direct information on  how 
affordable  housing services  are.2  Early in the p andemic , rent growth slowed as demand 
dropped to live in dense areas where rental housing tends to be concentrated while some 
people, especially young adults, moved in with family and friends .  However , more 
recently r ents have accelerated sharply.  On net, rents  have risen 6. 5 percent since 
January 2020 , according to the prices tracked under the Consumer Price Index (CPI) .  
That is  not out of line with the pace of rent increases seen in the CPI over the previous 
five years .  But there is good reason to think this  number doesn’t fully reflect the extent 
to which rents have grown .  CPI measures rents that people are currently paying, under 
leases that can be slow to reflect market conditions.  M eanwhile, m easures of market rent 
have increased a lot more than 6. 5 per cent over the last two years.  For example,  
CoreLogic’s single family rent index rose 12  percent over the 12 months through 
December, and RealPage’s measure of asking rent for units in multifamily buildings rose 
15 percent over the 12 months through February .  Based on various measures of asking 
rents, s ome recent research suggests that the rate of rent in flation  in the CPI will double 
in 2022.3  If so, rent as a component of inflation  will accelerate, which has implications 
for monetary policy.   
 
2 Rent is a direct measure of the price of housing services —i.e. the price of consuming the shelter and other 
services provided by a home.  By contr ast, the price to pu rchase a home is the price to invest in a specific 
real estate asset.  Therefore, price indexes with a goal of measuring price  changes of goods a nd services 
consumed by households generally use rents rather than house prices.

Rent is a significant share of monthly expenses for many households , but lower 
income households  spend a larger fraction of their budget on housing , so rising rents hit  
these  households harder .  In 2019, those in the lowest quintile of household income 
dedicated 41 percent of their spending to  housing, while those in the top quintile spent 
only 28 pe rcent.  One piece of better news for low -income renters is that rent increases 
have not been larger in the neighborhoods where they tend to live.  Specifically, data 
from RealPage suggest that asking rents rose 1 6 percent in both low- and moderate -
income n eighborhoods from January 2020 to February 2022, the same as in higher 
income neighborhoods.   
That’s the story on rent s.  What about the affordability of purchasing a home ?  
House prices are up a cumulative 3 5 percent since the beginning of the pandemic, 
according to the Zillow Home Value Index .  That rate of  increase  is much faster than the 
previous five years  and even faster than during the housing boom of the mid -2000s.   
Looking over the past two years, one would think the large increase in home prices would 
have made it more difficult for renters to become first -time buyers.  Surprisingly, we 
have not seen evidence of that yet.  The fraction of renters aged 20 to 45 who t ransitioned 
into home ownership last year was the highest since the Great Recession.  It could be that 
time spent at home during the pandemic made renters more interested in owning a home, 
or that people are getting help from family or friends with down pa yments, or that some

people are choosing to buy smaller homes than they would have a few years ago when 
prices were lower.  Whatever the causes, the increase in first time buyers is clear.   
Home buying during the pandemic has been strong among minority fa milies as 
well.   In 2020, 7.3 percent  of home purchase loans for owner -occupied properties were 
taken out by Black families, the highest level since 2007 and well above the low of 4.8 
percent  in 2013.   Still, the gap in homeownership rates between minori ty and white 
families remains very wide.  Moreover, according to Census Bureau data, 
homeownership rates for Black and Hispanic families appear to have edged down during 
2021.  These trends may reflect that the negative economic effects of the pandemic wer e 
felt disproportionately by minority households.  Indeed, research shows that minority homeowners were much more likely to miss mortgage payments and enter mortgage 
forbearance than white homeowners.  While federal and private sector forbearance 
programs helped many households keep their homes, families experiencing more 
permanent or severe income losses may have had to sell their homes and exit 
homeownership.    
Now, a  household’s ability to afford the purchase of a home is also a function of 
borrowing costs.  Monetary policy actions have had a noticeable effect  on mortgage rates.  
The Fed’s primary tool, the target range for the federal funds rate, was reduc ed to the 
effective lower bound in March 2020.  And, it was expected that the policy rate would 
remain low until the economy weathered the severe COVID -19 shock.  This setting and 
forward guidance on the target range put downward pressure on both shorter and longer -
term interest rates , including mortgage rates .  The Fed also purchase d Treasury securitie s 
and agency mortgage -backed securities (MBS) to help foster smooth market functioning  - 5 - 
and support accommodati ve financial conditions.  Research shows that the marginal 
effect of the agency MBS  purchases in response to the COVID shock lower ed mortgage 
rates about  40 basis points .4  On net , rates for 30 -year mortgage s fell about 1 percentage 
point from January 2020 to January 2021, which helped dampen  the costs of rising  house 
prices over that period.   
Through most of 2021 30 -year mortgage rates held pretty steady around 3  percent  
or less before beginning to rise at the end of the year.  Today, 30 -year mortgage rates are 
well above 4  percent  and are now somewhat  higher than they were when the pandemic 
bega n.  This increase can be partly attributed to Fed communications and actions.  
Specifically, communications at the end of 2021 indicated  that, with substantial recovery 
of the economy  and elevated inflation , monetary policy accommodation w ould begin to 
unwind.  First, we acted by  reduc ing and then stopp ing our asset purchases .  Second , 
earlier this month, we raised the target range for the federal funds rate above the effective 
lower bound and signaled that more policy tightening is  likely appropriate in  coming  
months .  As a result of these communications, m ortgage rates began to increase in late 
2021.   So, w hile lower rates  may have made ho me purchases  a bit more affordable early 
in the pandemic, the more recent rebound in mortgage rates an d the continued rise in 
prices have made home  purchases  less afford able for many people .  
In a nutshell , housing costs —measured either by rent s or by the average monthly 
payment  by homeowners —have increased  substantially during the pandemic .  Economics

tells us that some combination of growing demand and limits on housing supply has 
driven this change.  Let me talk about each of these in turn.  
Demand for housing space has been especially strong during the pa ndemic .  
Lockdowns as well as remote work and school may have spurred people to seek homes 
with more space, leading to an increase in demand for larger and otherwise better 
homes .5  In fact, t he average size of new single-family homes increased in 2021, 
reversing a downward trend from 2015 through 2020.  Retail sales at building supply 
stores surged during the pandemic , as homeowners adde d space  or made other 
improvements that could increase the quality of their home s.  In January , this spending  
was 42 per cent higher than the average for 2019, and even after adjustment for the sharp 
increase in the price of building materials, it was still up 19 percent.  One indication of 
people trading up for housing  is evident by comparing  Zillow ’s Home Value Index es by 
housing type .  The index for single -family homes has increased more than that for 
condominiums  since January 2020.  In addition, purchases of second homes ha ve 
increased.  Second homes averaged about 3½  percent of home purchase loan originations 
from 2 014 to 2019 but about 5 percent of originations in 2021.  The 2021 share was in 
line with the peak see n during the last housing boom.  
Meanwhile, changes in household formation may have been contributing to 
increases in housing demand over the past year or so .  While many households increased 
in size during the early months of the pandemic , as young people returned to their

parents’ homes, this change appears to have largely reversed by the end of 2021.  The 
fraction of adults aged 18 to 30 who are the heads  of their own households is now back 
near its 2017-2019 average.  The surge in the number of households has push ed down 
housing vacancy rates from already -low levels.  Rental and homeowner vacancy rates  f ell 
considerably during the pandemic, reaching  lows in the fourth quarter of last year that 
haven’t been seen since the 1980s.  
The pandemic -related changes in demand for housing, rented and owned, 
coincided with a longer -run increase in demand to live in certain parts of the country.  
For the past several d ecades, demand for living in cities with high -paying jobs and many 
urban amenities has surged, pushing up housing costs  in these areas .  Among metro areas 
in the top quartile of local housing demand, population increased 80 percent , and single -
family home  prices rose more than 110 percent from 1990 to 2019 after adjusting for 
inflation .6  For the nation as a whole, population only increased 32 percent and house 
prices rose 59 percent.   
While this trend towards urban living supported commercial real estate demand 
and prices for years, post pandemic, more people are working at home and there  has been 
a corresponding decline in demand for office space, particularly in downtown areas.  Office entry card swipes are down 50 percent from pre-pandemic levels in large cities, 
and office vacancy rates are up nationwide, from 12 percent in 2019 to 16 percent in the 
fourth quarter of 2021.  The increases have been larger in urban areas, and particularly in 
the downtown areas of big coastal cities.  We’ll need to see if people continue working 
from home .  While low C OVID case rates may induce some worker s to return to the

infla tion -adjusted home prices from 1990 to 2019.   - 8 - 
office , some  may only return part -time, while others may not return at all, as many 
organizations have made adjustment s to function  effectively with remote workers . 
That’s the demand side.   The supply side has been pushing in the same 
direction —towards tighter housing markets  and more expensive shelter .  U.S. housing 
supply has probably been more constrained lately than at any time since the end of World 
War II.  One estimate is that the current growth in the supply of new housing units i s 
about 100,000 less per year that would be needed to support trend increases in demand 
from household formation and replacement of depreciating units.7  Supply adjusts to 
changes in the economy more slowly than demand because of the time it takes to plan  
and build.  With workers at  home and supply bottlenecks , there were pandemic-related 
drops in the production and importation of many construction materials .  These  supply 
shortages contributed to skyrocketing input prices.  In January 2022, lumber prices 
included in the Producer Price Index were 92 percent higher than the 2019 average.  Even 
with increased materials costs , suppliers have been unable to keep up with demand.  The  
volume of lumber  now being sold is  more than 150  percent  higher than last August and is 
similarly larger than the average volume over the previous ten years.8   
Labor is also a key input  in home construction.  The supply of construction labor, 
like other sectors , has been held down by pandemic -specific issues like early retirement.  
One measure of labor market tightness for the construction industry increased steadily 
from 2010 to 2019 and then in 2021 was more than double the level recorded during the 
construction boom of the mid-2000s.9

9 This mea s ure of labor market tightness is the job openings rate divided by the unemployment rate.   - 9 - 
Local land use regulations have also played a role in constrain ing housing supply 
over the past several decades .  Probably not by accident, these regulations have tended to 
be more restrictive in areas with high housing demand.  There has been a growing public 
debate about the se restrictions on local home building, not just at the local level , but 
among governors and state legislatures .  While some  local regulations have been changed  
to allow  more housing construction in high demand areas, the effects  will take time, and 
it remains to be seen whether the increases in supply created by these regulatory changes 
will be enough to satisfy local demand.  
I’ve mentioned the impact of monetary policy on housing markets, now let me 
touch on the role of fiscal policy.  The rescue plan passed by the Congress in 2020, 
consisting of stimulus payments, grants to small businesses to maintain their payrolls, and 
supplemental unemployment benefits, surely helped many people who lost income during 
the pandemic continue to pay their rent and mortgage s.  Rental delinquency only 
increased a bit  during the first year of the pandemic , and although mortgage non-payment 
increased by a larger amount , it remained well below the level experienced in the Great 
Recession.  Another  policy tool that was used quite effectively in the earlier stages of the 
pandemic was mortgage forbearance.  Borrowers with government -backed and federally -
insured mortgages were given up to 18 months of forbearance, and many private lenders also offered fo rbearance.  Indications are that the extra time this bought for borrowers 
really helped .  Many borrowers who exited forbearance in 2021 were able to resume 
making payments, or, in the hot housing market, were able to sell their homes and walk 
away with equ ity.  For other borrowers, simple mortgage modification plans have helped  - 10 - 
mortgage servicers to quickly and easily modify mortgage s to help people stay in their 
homes at a lower monthly payment.   
That said, we must remember that there are institutions on the other side of the 
mortgage forbearance process .  Servicers of mortgages in MBS pools are required to 
continue to make payments to the investors who hold these securities, even when they are 
not receiving payments from the borrower.   Banks were well -prepared to extend 
forbearance because of  their access to an array of liquidity sources such as deposits, the 
Federal Home Loan Bank  system, and the Fed’s discount window.  Moreover, many 
banks entered the pandemic with a strong capital position and improved risk management  
practices as a result of changes after the Global Financial Crisis .  However, more than 
half of mortgages are serviced by nonbanks , which do not have access to the same 
liquidity sources as banks .  So, the announcement of forbearance in 2020 caused an acute 
concern about liquidity for nonbanks .  Thankfully, a large wave of mortgage refinancing 
helped to provide nonbank servicers the needed liquidity.10  In addition, a facility created 
by Ginnie Mae to le nd to nonbank service rs, as well as limits on the number of payment 
advances required for loan s by government sponsored enterprises , helped to further 
mitigate the liquidity concerns.  I n the end, forbearance never reached the high level  that 
many analysts  expected .  But, looking ahead , this experience points to the importance of 
building resilience among non-banks engaged in mortgage lending and servic ing. 
An important question I will keep my eye on is whether the sharp and ongoing 
increase in home prices poses risks to financial stability.   My short answer is  that unlike 
the housing bubble and crash of mid 2000s, the recent increase seems to be sustained by 
 
10 Ma ny nonbank servicers a lso origina te mortgages.   - 11 - 
the substantive supply and demand issues I have detailed—not by excessive leverage, 
looser underwrit ing standards, or financial speculation.   In fact, m ortgage borrowers  
entered the pandemic with strong er balance sheets  than in the mid 2000s  and are 
therefore  better prepared to handle a drop in home prices  than they were in the last 
housing downturn.  As for banks, as I just said, large banks are substantially more 
resilient today than two decades ago.   In last year’s stress test, which featured a  severe 
global recession that included a decline in home pric es of over 20 percent, we projected 
the large st banks could collectively maintain capital ratios at more than double their 
minimum requirements —even after withstanding more than $470 billion in losses.  
I am hopeful that at least some of the pandemic -specif ic factors pushing up home 
prices  and rents could begin to ease in the next year or so.  T he level of new housing units 
completed in 2021 was higher than at any point since 2007 .  The demand for extra space 
at home might level off , or even reverse if peopl e start to spend more time away from 
home again as the pandemic ease s.  That said, input prices continue to rise, with lumber 
prices increasing past their eye-popping 2020 peak , even with much more supply.  
Longer term , many  issues will continue to put upw ard pressure o n home prices 
and rents.  The strong demand to live in cities with tight housing supply is likely to 
continue.  Regulatory supply constraints may be starting  to ease in some places, but they 
will persist and continue to limit home building in  many high demand areas.  And while 
prices for lumber and other materials may come down , with the economy already at 
maximum employment and experiencing a shortage of skilled workers, labor supply will 
likely continue to hold back the pace of new construction .    - 12 - 
As housing costs continue to increase, housing will likely become an ever -larger 
share of household budgets.  This is not a recent development.  In 1972-1973, the averag e 
household spent 24 percent of expenditure s on rent  or imputed rent .  This share rose to  27 
percent in the late 1980s, and in 2019 that was up to 35 percent.  No doubt the share in 
2022 will be  larger still.  With housing  costs gaining an ever -larger weight in the inflation 
Americans experience, I will be looking even more closely at real estate to  judge the 
appropriate stance of monetary policy.

Extreme economic events have often challenged existing views of how the 
economy works and exposed shortcomings in the collective knowledge of economists.  
To give two well -known examples, both the Great Depression and the stagflation of the 
1970s motivated new ways of thinking about economic phenomena.  More recently, the financial crisis and its aftermath might well prove to be a similar sort of turning point.  Today I would like to reflect on some ways in which the events of the past few years have reveal ed limits  in economists’ understanding of the economy and suggest several 
important quest ions I hope the profession will try to answer.  Some of these questions are 
not new, though recent events have made them more urgent.  Appropriately, some are addressed by the papers prepared for this conference.  Pursuing answers to these questions is vital to the work of Federal Reserve and other economic policymakers, and the Fed is likewise engaged in ongoing research to seek answers.  
The I nfluence of Demand on Aggregate Supply  
The first question I would like to pose concerns the distinction between aggregate 
supply and aggregate demand:  Are there circumstances in which changes in aggregate 
demand can have an appreciable, persistent effect on aggregate supply?  
Prior to the Great Recession, most economists would probably have answered this 
question with a qualified “no.”  They would have broadly agreed with Robert Solow that 
economic output over the longer term  is primarily driven by supply-- the amount of output 
of goods and services the economy is capable of producing, given its labor and capital resources and existing technologies.  Aggregate demand, in contrast, was seen as explaining short er-term fluctuations around the mostly exogenous supply- determined  - 2 - 
longe r-run trend.1  This conclusion deserves to be reconsidered in light of the failure of 
the level of economic activity to return to its pre -recession trend in most advanced 
economies.  This post -crisis experience suggests that changes in aggregate demand may  
have an appreciable, persistent effect on aggregate supply --that is, on potential output.2   
The idea that persistent shortfalls in aggregate demand could adversely affect the 
supply side of the economy--an effect commonly referred to as hysteresis--is no t new; for 
example, the possibility was discussed back in the mid- 1980s with regard to the 
performance of European labor markets.3  But interest in the topic has increased in light 
of the persistent slowdown in economic growth seen in many developed econom ies since 
the crisis.  Several recent studies present cross- country evidence  indicating that severe 
and persistent recessions have historically had these sorts of long -term effects, even for 
downturns that appear to have resulted largely or entirely from a  shock to aggregate 
demand.4  With regard to the U.S. experience, one study estimates that the level of 
potential output is now 7 percent below what would have been expected based on its pre -
crisis trajectory, and it argues that much of this supply- side da mage is attributable to 
several developments that likely occurred as a result of the deep recession and slow 
recovery.5  In particular, the study finds that in the wake of the crisis, the United States 
experienced a modest reduction in labor supply as a re sult of reduced immigration and a 
fall in labor force participation beyond what can be explained by cyclical conditions and 
                                                 
1 See Solow  (1997).  
2 Or, as Summers (2014) asked in a pithy inversion of Say’s law, is it true that “lack of demand creates lack 
of supply?” (p. 37).  
3 As Blanchard and Summers (1986) discuss, the question at the time was whether the long- run 
equilibrium, or “natural,” rate of unemployment in European economies had been permanently raised by 
previous periods of high actual unemployment.  
4 For example, see Cerra and Saxena (2008); Howard, Martin, and Wilson (2011); Martin, Nunyan, and 
Wilson  (2014); and Blanchard, Cerutti, and Summers (2015).  
5 See Reifschneider, Wascher, and Wilcox (2015).   - 3 - 
demographic factors , as well as a marked slowdown in the estimated trend growth rate of 
labor productivity.  The latter likely refle cts an unusually slow pace of business capital 
accumulation since the crisis and , more conjecturally , the sharp decline in spending on 
research and development and the very slow pace of new firm formation in recent years.6 
If we assume that hysteresis is i n fact present to some degree after deep 
recessions, the natural next question is to ask whether it might be possible to reverse 
these adverse supply -side effects by temporarily running a “high- pressure economy,”  
with robust aggregate demand and a tight la bor market.  On e can certainly identify 
plausible ways in which this might occur.  Increased business sales would almost certainly raise the productive capacity of the economy by encouraging additional capital spending, especially if accompanied by reduced uncertainty about future prospects.  In 
addition, a tight labor market might draw in potential workers who would otherwise sit on the sidelines and encourage job -to-job transitions that could also lead to more -
efficient --and, hence, more -productive --job m atches.
7  Finally, albeit more speculatively, 
strong demand could potentially yield significant productivity gains by, among other things, prompting higher levels of research and development  spending and  increasing the 
incen tives to start new, innovative b usinesses.   
Hysteresis effects--and the possibility they might be reversed --could have 
important implications for the conduct of monetary and fiscal policy.  For example, hysteresis would seem to make it even more important for policymakers to act quickly 
                                                 
6 Fernald (2015), however, argues that much of the apparent slowdown in U.S. potential GDP growth 
began prior to the 2007- 09 recession.  
7 See Okun  (1973) for an early discussion of the benefits of a high -pressure economy.  Importantly, not all 
of these benefits might show up as measured output, but they would nonetheless  be welfare improving-- for 
example, higher job satisfaction from better matches between workers and employers, as noted by Akerlof, 
Rose, and Yellen (1988).   - 4 - 
and aggressively in response to a recession, because doing so would help to reduce the 
depth and persistence of the downturn, thereby limiting the supply- side damage that 
might otherwise ensue.  In addition, if strong economic conditions can partially reverse supply- side damage after it has occurred, then policymakers may want to aim at being 
more accommodative during recoveries than would be called for under the traditional 
view that supply is largely independent of demand.   
More research is needed, however, to better understand the influence of 
movements in aggregate demand on aggregate supply.
8  From a policy perspective, we of 
course need to bear in mind that an accommodative monetary stance, if maintained too long, could have costs that exceed the benefits by increasing the risk of financial instability or undermining price stability.  More ge nerally, the benefits and potential costs 
of pursuing such a strategy remain hard to quantify, and other policies might be better suited to address damage to the supply side of the economy.   
Heterogeneity  
My second question asks whether individual differe nces within  broad groups of 
actors in the economy can influence  aggregate economic outcomes --in particular, what  
effect does such heterogeneity have on aggregate demand? 
Many macroeconomists work with models where groups of individual actors, 
such as households or firms, are treated as a single “representative” agent whose behavior stands in for that of the group as a whole.  For example, rather than explicitly modeling 
                                                 
8 For example, the experience of the 1990s might seem to provide a natural case study of whether re verse 
hysteresis is possible.  Unfortunately, most studies of the labor market during this period do not directly 
speak to this issue, although Holzer, Raphael, and Stoll (2006) investigate changes in employers’ 
willingness to hire less -skilled workers dur ing these years, while Katz and Krueger  (1999) and my own 
study with Blinder  (2001) explore the somewhat related question of how the U.S. economy was able to 
simultaneously experience rapid growth, low unemployment, and low inflation in the late 1990s.    - 5 - 
and then adding up the separate actions of a large number of different households, a 
macro model might instead assume that the behavior of a single “average” household can describe the aggregate behavior of all households.  
Prior to the financial crisis, these so -called representative- agent models  were the 
dominant paradigm for analyzing many macroeconomic questions .  However, a 
disaggregated approach seems needed to understand some key aspects of the Great Recession.  To give one example, consider the effects of negative housing equity on consumption.  Although households typically reduce  their spending in response to wealth 
declines, the many households whose equity positions in their homes were actually driven negative  by the reduction in house prices may have curtailed their spending even 
more sharply because of a markedly reduced abili ty to borrow .  Such a development, in 
turn, would shift the relationship between housing equity (which remained s olidly  
positive  in the aggregate) and consumer spending for the economy as a whole.  Such a 
shift in an aggregate relationship would be difficult to understand or predict without using disaggregated data and models. 
More generally, studying the effects of household and firm heterogeneity might 
help us better account for the severity of the recession and the slow recovery.  At the household level, recent research finds that heterogeneity can amplify the effects of adverse shocks, a result that is largely driven by households with very little net worth that sharply increase their savings in a recession.
9  At the firm level, there is evidence that 
financial constraints had a particularly large adverse effect on employment at  small firms  
and the start -up of new firms , factors that may be part of the explanation for the Great 
                                                 
9 See Krueger, Mitman, and Perri (2016).    - 6 - 
Recession’s long duration and the subsequent slow recovery.10  More generally, if larger 
firms seeking to expand have better access to credit than smaller ones, overall growth in 
investment and employment could depend in part on the distribution of sales across 
different types of businesses.  Modeling any of these issues quantitatively will likely 
require the use of a heterogeneous -agent framework.     
Economists’ understanding of how changes in fiscal and monetary policy affect 
the economy might also benefit from the recognition that households and firms are 
heterogeneous .  For example, in simple textbook models of the monetary transmission 
mechanism, central banks operate largely through the effect of real interest rates on consumption and investment.  Once heterogeneity is taken into account, other important  
channels emerge.  For example, spending by many households and firms appears to be quite sensitive to changes in labor income, business sales, or the value of collateral that in 
turn affects their access to credit --conditions that monetary policy affects only indirectly.  
Studying monetary models with heterogeneous agents more closely could help us shed new light on these aspects of the monetary transmission mechanism.  
While the economics profession has long been aware that these issues matter, 
their effec ts had been incorporated into macro models only to a very limited extent prior 
to the financial crisis.
11  I am glad to now see a greater emphasis on the possible 
macroeconomic consequences of heterogeneity, including in work by economists at the 
                                                 
10 On the role of financing constraints for firm employment, see Siemer (2014); Chodorow- Reich (2014); 
and Duygan -Bump, Levkov, and Montoriol- Garriga (2015).  A general -equilibrium model with 
heterogeneity among fir ms and credit frictions is studied in Khan and Thomas (2013).  For the role of entry 
and exit in macroeconomic dynamics, see Clementi and Palazzo (2016) as well as Gourio, Messer, and

Federal Reserve.12  Nevertheless, the various linkages between heterogeneity and 
aggregate demand are not yet well understood, either empirically or theoretically.  More 
broadly, even though the tools of monetary policy are generally not well suited to achieve distributional objectives, it is important for policymakers to understand and monitor the effects of macroeconomic developments on different groups within society. 
Financial Linkages to the Real Economy 
My third question concerns a key issue for monetary policy and macroeconomics 
that is less directly addressed by this conference:  How does the financial sector interact 
with the broader economy ?   
In light of the housing bubble and subsequent events, policymakers clearly need 
to better understand what kinds of de velopments contribute to financial crises.  What is 
the relationship between the buildup of excessive leverage and the value of real estate and 
other types of collateral, and what factors impede or facilitate the deleveraging process 
that follows?  Does th e economic fallout from a financial crisis depend on the particulars 
of the crisis, such as whether it involves widespread damage to household balance sheets?  
How does the nature and degree of the interconnections between financial firms affect the propagation and amplification of stress through the financial system and overall economy?  F inally --and most importantly --what can monetary policy and financial 
oversight do to reduce the frequency and severity of future crises?  
                                                 
12 Guvenen (2011) reviews several issues related to macroeconomics with heterogeneity.  For an overview 
of the interactions between distribution and aggregate outcomes, s ee the work by Quadrini and Rios -Rull 
(2015).  For recent work on the effects of monetary policy in models with hete rogeneous agents, see 
Kaplan, M oll, and Violante ( 2016 ); Gornemann, Kuester, and Nakajima (2016); Auclert ( 2016); and Sterk 
and Tenreyro (20 16).  - 8 - 
Although the scope of these quest ions extends beyond the themes of this 
conference, it does include issues that are closely related.  Consider the influence of 
balance sheet conditions and noninterest credit terms on spending and overall activity --an 
area where it is important to take acc ount of differences  across individual households and 
firms , as I just noted.  Research on this topic has, of course, been ongoing for some time, 
and it has expanded greatly in the wake of the financial crisis.13  But I believe we have a 
lot more to learn about the ways in which changes in underwriting standards and other determinants of credit availability interact with interest rates to affect such things as 
consumer spending, housing demand and home prices, bus iness investment (especially 
for small firms), and the formation of new firms.
14  For example, is the persistent increase 
in the personal saving rate that we have observed since the collapse of the housing bubble 
primarily a result of a sustained shift towa rd more prudent underwriting standards by 
                                                 
13 For an example of early research on this topic, see Bernanke and Gertler (1989).  Other important pre-
crisis studies include the development of the financial accelerato r model by Bernanke and others (1999a) 
and work by Kashyap and Stein (2000) and Peek, Rosengren, and Tootell (2003) on the bank balance sheet 
channel and the effects of bank loan supply shocks.  For a more recent summary of the role of banks in the 
monetary transmission mechanism, see Peek and Rosengren (2013).  Chaney, Sraer, and Thesmer (2012) 
provide evidence for the collateral channel of real estate for corporate investment, while Mian, Rao, and 
Sufi (2013) examine  the influence of household balance sheets on consumption.  
14 More empirical work would be useful to disentangle the spending effects that result from changes in 
credit conditions from those that result from movements in interest rates, as estimates of the latter likely 
often inadvertently incorporate the former.  Most empirical mo dels of the overall economy do not explicitly 
control for the influence of noninterest credit factors on consumption and investment; as a result, estimated interest rate effects will partially reflect the influence of these factors to the extent these fact ors are 
correlated with interest rates.  There are many reasons to suspect that this is the case.  Movements in 
interest rates influence a firm’s cash flow and the value of its collateral, all else being equal.  Higher 
interest rates also adversely affect consumer spending and especially residential investment, both by 
forcing households to devote a greater portion of their income to debt service and by making it more difficult to qualify for a loan because of maximum payment -to-income rules.  Evidence for these effects is 
provided by Gertler and Karadi  (2015), who show that relatively small changes in short- term interest rates 
are correlated with large movements in credit costs.  Such correlations and interactions may explain why some types of spending appe ar to be more correlated with movements in nominal interest rates than with 
real interest rates; see Fair  (2004, ch.  3) for evidence on this point.  Finally, the relative contributions of 
relaxed lending standards, low interest rates, and other factors to housing bubbles, both in the United States 
and abroad, remain s an open and unsettled topic ; Agnello and Shucknecht (2011) present cross -country 
evidence that monetary policy plays an important role, while Dokko and others (2011) argue that monetary 
policy was a minor influence in the most recent episode.   - 9 - 
lenders?   Is it something that will ultimately prove transitory once households  finish 
repairing their balance sheets or become more confident about their future prospects for 
employment and income?15  The answer to  this latter question could have significant 
implications for the longer- run normal , or neutral , level of interest rates and thus for the 
conduct of monetary policy.  
Inflation Dynamics  
My fourth question goes to the heart of monetary policy:  W hat determi nes 
inflation?  
From my perspective, the standard framework for thinking about inflation 
dynamics used by central bank economists and others prior to the financial crisis remains conceptually useful today.  A simple description of this framework might go something like this :
16  Inflation is characterized by an underlying trend that has been essentially 
constant since the mid -1990s; previously, this trend seemed to drift over time, influenced 
by actual past inflation or other economic conditions.  Theory and e vidence suggest that 
this trend is strongly influenced by inflation expectations that, in turn, depend on monetary policy.  In particular, the remarkable stability of various measures of expected inflation in recent years presumably represents the fruits o f the Federal Reserve’s 
sustained efforts since the early 1980s to bring down and then stabilize inflation at a low level.  The anchoring of inflation expectations that has resulted from this policy does not, however, prevent actual inflation from fluctuat ing from year to year in response to the 
temporary influence of movements in energy prices and other disturbances.  In addition, 
                                                 
15 See Mian, Rao, and Sufi (2013) for an assessment of the role of leverage and housing wealth shocks in 
driving consumption during the Great Recession.  Work by Justiniano , Primiceri, and Tambalotti (2015)  
suggests that debt overhang alone cannot explain the slow recovery from the Great Recession.  
16 See Yellen (2015) for a more exten sive discussion.   - 10 - 
inflation will tend to run above or below its underlying trend to the extent that resource 
utilization --which may serve as an i ndicator of firms’ marginal costs --is persistently high 
or low.17 
While this general framework for thinking about the inflation process remains 
useful, questions about some of its quantitative features have arisen in the wake of the Great Recession and the subsequent slow recovery.  For example, the influence of labor 
market conditions on inflation in recent years seems to be weaker than had been commonly thought prior to the financial crisis.  Although inflation fell during the recession, the decline was qu ite modest given how high unemployment rose; likewise, 
wages and prices rose comparatively little as the labor market gradually recovered.  Whether this reduction in sensitivity was somehow caused by the recession or instead pre-dated it and was merely rev ealed under extreme conditions is unclear.
18  Either way, 
the underlying cause is unknown.  Does the reduced sensitivity reflect structural changes, 
such as globalization or a greater role for intangible capital in production that have 
reduced the importanc e of cyclical swings in domestic activity for firms’ marginal costs 
and pricing power?  Or does it perhaps reflect the well- documented reluctance --or, 
                                                 
17 In the economic literature, this general description of the inflation process is referred to as the 
expectations -augmented Phillips curve.  In its simplest form, the Phillips curve relates inflation to expected 
inflation and the intensity of resource utilization in the economy.  In practice, however, empirical 
specifications also typically include measures of s upply shocks, such as changes in the relative prices of 
energy or imported goods, as additional determinants.  Two well -known variants of the Phillips curve are 
the traditional “accelerationist” specification and the so -called New Keynesian Phillips curve;  the former 
approximates inflation expectations using a moving average of past inflation, while the latter assumes that 
inflation expectations are “rational” and consistent with the predictions of a structural model of the entire 
economy.  Some adherents o f either type of Phillips curve argue that their preferred model can explain the 
behavior of inflation during and after the financial crisis.  For example, Gordon  (2013) presents evidence in 
favor of an accelerationist model, while Del Negro, Giannoni, and  Schorfheide (2015) make this claim for a 
New Keynesian model.  
18 See Blanchard (2016) for evidence on how the responsiveness of inflation to resource utilization has 
changed over time.  Interestingly, research suggests that this sensitivity began declining well before the 
crisis.   - 11 - 
alternatively, limited ability --of firms to cut the nominal wages of their employees, which 
could help to explain the relatively moderate movements in inflation we saw during and 
after the recession ?19 
Another gap in our knowledge about the nature of the inflation process concerns 
expectations.  Although many theoretical models suggest that actual inflation should be most closely related to short -run inflation expectations, as an empirical matter, measures 
of long- run expectations appear to explain the data better.
20  Yet a nother unresolved issue 
concerns whose  expectations --those of consumers, firms, or investors --are most relevant 
for wage and price setting, a point on which theory provides no clear -cut guidance.  More 
generally, the precise manner in which expectations influence inflation deserves further study.
21 
Perhaps most importantly, we need to know more about the manner in which 
inflation expectations are formed and how monetary policy influences them.  Ultimately, 
both actual and expected inflation  are tied to the central bank’s inflation target, whether 
that target is explicit or implicit.22  But how does this anchoring process occur?  Does a 
central bank have to keep actual inflation near the target rate for many years before 
inflation expectations completely conform?  Can policymakers instead materially 
                                                 
19 For an early discussion of the potential macroeconomic effects of downward nominal wage rigidity, see 
Akerlof, Dickens, and Perry (1996).  More recently, Daly and Hobijn (2014) develop a model in which the 
reluctance or inability  of firms to cut nominal wages (or both)  creates important nonlinearities in the 
relationship between labor utilization and wage inflation.  Finally, Fallick, Lettau, and Wascher (2015) 
review the evidence for downward nominal wage rigidity in recent years  and explore the ways in which it 
has interacted with labor market stress over time.  
20 Specifically, survey measures of long -run inflation expectations are broadly correlated with estimates of 
inflation’s longer -term trend.  See Clark and Davig  (2008) ; see also Faust and Wright (2013, who make a 
related point in the co ntext of inflation forecasting.  
21 As Mavroeidis, Plagborg -Moller, and Stock (2014) conclude from their exhaustive survey, empirical 
estimates of the New Keynesian inflation equation are “unab le to pin down the role of expectations in the 
inflation process sufficiently accurately for the results to be useful for policy analysis” (p.  172).  
22 For a discussion of the theoretical and empirical influence of monetary policy on inflation in the contex t 
of a formal inflation -targeting regime, see Bernanke and others (1999b).   - 12 - 
influence inflation expectations directly and quickly by simply announcing their intention 
to pursue a particular inflation goal in the future?  Or does the truth lie somewhere in 
between, with a change in expectations requiring some combination of clear communications about policymakers’ inflation goal, concrete policy actions to demonstrate their commitment to that goal, and at least some success in moving actual inflation toward its desired level in order to demonstrate the feasibility of the strategy?  Although historical experience suggests that changing the public’s inflation expectations 
would be neither quick nor easy, it is not clear which of these possibilities is correct.
23  
With nominal short -term interest rates at or close to their effective lower b ound in 
many countries, the broader question of how expectations are formed has taken on heightened importance.  Under such circumstances, many central banks have sought additional ways to stimulate their economies, including adopting policies that are dir ectly 
aimed at influencing expectations of future interest rates and inflation.  The unusually 
explicit and extended guidance about the likely future path of the federal funds rate that 
was provided by the FOMC from 2011 through 2014 is an example of such a policy, as is the Bank of Japan’s upward revision to its official inflation objective in 2013.  Moreover, these and other expectational strategies may be needed again in the future, given the 
likelihood that the global economy may continue to experience historically low interest 
rates, thereby making it unlikely that reductions in short -term interest rates alone  would 
be an adequate response to a future recession.
24   
                                                 
23 See Kiley (2008) for a discussion of the relationship between U.S. monetary policy and survey measures 
of long -run inflation expectations; his results suggest that it took many y ears for the Federal Reserve to 
succeed in anchoring long- run expectations at a low level.  In a similar vein, Bernanke and others (1999b) 
conclude that inflation expectations “respond only after a lag following declines in [actual] inflation” 
(p. 298) based on their study of the effects of adopting inflation targeting in different countries.   
24 I discussed this likelihood in a recent speech  (Yellen, 2016).    - 13 - 
For all of these reasons, I hope that researchers will strive to improve our 
understanding of inflation dynamics and its interactions with monetary policy.  
International Linkages  
Before closing, let me mention one additional area where more study is needed--
the effects of changes in U.S. monetary policy on financial and economic conditions in 
the rest of the world and the ways in which those foreign effects can feed back to influence conditions here at home.  Of course, cross- country monetary policy spillovers 
have been the subject of scholarly debate since the Great Depression, and much of the formal analysis of this topic dates back to the early 1960s.
25  But this issue has received 
renewed interest with the advent of unconventional monetary policies after the Great Recession and, more recently, the divergence of monetary policies among major advanced- economy central banks.   
Broadly speaking, monetary policy actions in one country spill over to other 
economies through three main channels:  changes in exchange rates; changes in domestic 
demand, which alter the economy’s imports; and changes in d omestic financial 
conditions --such as interest rates  and asset prices --that, through portfolio balance and 
other channels, affect financial conditions abroad.  Research by Federal Reserve staff 
suggest s that, all told, U.S. monetary policy spillovers to ot her economies are positive--
that is, policies designed to provide stimulus to the U.S. economy also boost activity abroad, as negative effects of dollar depreciation are offset by positive effects of higher 
U.S. imports and easier foreign financial conditi ons.
26  However, this issue is far from 
                                                 
25 See Mundell (1963) and Fleming (1962).  
26 See Ammer, De  Pooter, Erceg, and Kamin  (2016) .  Other recent research on this topic includes Fukuda, 
Kimura, Sudo, and Ugai (2013); Georgiadis (2015); Glick and Leduc (2015); and Ilzetski and Jin (2013).   - 14 - 
settled, as are a host of other related questions, including the following:  Do U.S. 
monetary policy actions affect advanced and emerging market countries differently?  Do 
conventional and unconventional monetary poli cies spill over to other countries 
differently?  And to what extent are U.S. interest rates and financial conditions influenced 
by easing measures abroad?   
Conclusion 
In closing, I would like to commend the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston for 
organizing this conference and fostering research and debate on questions vital to our 
understanding of the economy.  Answering these questions will help the Federal Reserve’s efforts to promote a healthy economy, and I am grateful for the opportunity to speak to you t oday and be part of this important discussion.

How Is COVID-19 Affecting Your Community?”  
sponsored by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  
 
Washington, D.C.  
       
May 21, 2020 
  
Good afternoon.  I just want to say a few words of welcome and thank everyone 
for being here —albeit in much different circumstances than would oth erwise be 
expected.  
We’ve held many Fed Listens events over the past 16 months, and it’s important 
to note that these conversations aren’t just a nice way to talk to people from around the 
country, a lthough they are that.  What they provide —what you provide —is insight that 
we just can’t get anywhere else.  You add depth and definition to the flood of data that flows through the Fed each day.  You give us perspective on the economic realities that don’t show up on a spreadsheet.  You help us see those complex sets of data that analyze the American economy through the eyes of the people, businesses, and communities that make up the American economy.  And that information is very helpful to us as we make 
our policy decisions.  
So this is a valuable exercise for us.  And an enjoyable one as well, so we truly do 
appreciate it on a number of levels.  The Reserve Banks are also continuing to host conversations in communities across the country to help capture economic realities on the ground. 
We are in the midst of an economic downturn without modern precedent.  It was 
sudden, and it is severe.  It has already erased the job gains of the past decade and has 
inflicted acute pain across the country.  And while the burden is widespread, it is not evenly spread.  Th ose taking the brunt of the fallout are those least able to bear it.  
The pain of this downturn is compounded by the upending of normal life, along 
with great uncertainty about the future.  In the best of times, predicting the path of the economy with any certainty is difficult.  John Kenneth Galbraith famously said that  - 2 - 
economic forecasting exists to make astrology look respectable.   We are now 
experiencing a whole new level of uncertainty, as questions only the virus can answer 
complicate the outlook.  
Policies that address the resumption of economic activity are the province of 
elected officials at all levels of government, in close consultation with public health and medical professionals.  But all of us have our own decisions to make as well, and those decisions will depend on public confidence that it is again safe to undertake various activities.  From an economic perspective, we hope to learn a lot from your experiences and from what you’re hearing from your colleagues, customers, and communities :  How  
they’re coping with that uncertainty now, how they’re thinking about a future that’s harder to plan for, and what matters most as they navigate the path.  
The feedback we get from our community and business contacts has always been 
crucial in how we conduc t monetary policy.  In extraordinary times such as these, it takes 
on even greater importance.  I want to thank you again for providing that insight and look forward to the conversation. 
Thank you.

Thank you for this opportunity to show my support for the work all of you do  on 
asset -building, and to say a few  words on this vitally important topic .   
The financial crisis and the Great Recession demonstrated , in a dramatic and 
unmistakable manner , how extraordinarily vulnerable are the large share of American 
families with very few assets to fall back on.  We ha ve come far from the worst moments 
of the crisis , and the economy continues to improve.  But the effects of the recession are 
still being felt  by many families, particularly those that had very little in savings and 
other assets before hand . 
To help make th is point, I’d like to cite a few numbers from the Federal Reserve’s 
2013 Survey of Consumer Finances, published earlier this month.  The Survey  is 
conducted every three years and this new edition provides one of the first good looks at 
how families in different economic circumstances have fared in the recovery.  
For lower -income families, w hat we find is sobering .  The median net worth 
reported by the bottom fifth of households by income w as only $6,400 in 2013 .  Among 
this group, representing about 25 million American households, m any families had no 
wealth or had negative net worth.  The next fifth of households by income  had median 
net worth of just $27, 900.  These numbers represent declines from 2010 .  One reason is 
that income has continued to fall for these families .   
Another likely reason for this decli ne in net worth is the lingering effects of the 
housing crisis .  Home  equity account s for the lion’s share of wealth  for most families  and 
many of these families have not yet recovered the wealth th ey lost in the housing crisis.  
The h ousing market is improving and housing will remain an important channel for asset 
building for lower and middle income families.  But one of the lessons of the crisis, - 2 - 
 
which will not be news to many of you, is the importance of diversification and 
especially of  possessing savings and other liquid financial assets to fall back in times of 
economic distress .   
Yet for lower and middle income families, f inancial assets, including 401 (k) 
plans and pensions, are still a  very small s hare of their assets .  According to the 2013 
survey, t he bottom half of families by income held  only 8 percent of all financial assets  
held by households . 
A larger lesson  from the financial crisis , of course, is how important it is to  
promote asset -building,  including saving for a rainy day, as protection from the u ps and 
downs of the economy.  I surely  hope that our nation will not face a nother  crisis anytime 
soon as severe as the one we recently experienced .  But for  many l ower -income familie s 
without assets, the definition of a financial crisis is a month or two without a paycheck, or 
the advent of a sudden illness or some other unexpected expense.  Families with assets to 
draw on are able to deal with these developments as bumps in the road.  Families without 
these assets can end up , very suddenly,  off the road .  According to the Board’s recent 
Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking , an unexpected expense of just 
$400 would prompt  the majority of households to borrow money, sell something,  or 
simply not pay at all.  
The Federal Reserve ’s mission is to promote a healthy economy and strong 
financial system, and that is why we have promoted and will continue to promote asset -
building.  One way we do this is through the Community Development programs  at each 
of our 12 Reserve Banks, and through the Federal Reserve Board’s Division of Consumer 
and Community Affairs in Washington.  As a research institution, and a convener of - 3 - 
 
stakeholders inv olved in community development, I believe  the Fed can help you in 
carrying out your mission, to encourage families to take the small steps that over time can 
lead to the accumulation of considerable  assets.  
Thank you for the chance to be a small part of th is conference, and for your 
commitment to a cause that I strongly support.

Hello.  I’m Ben Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System.  I appreciate this opportunity to speak to the business and finance 
students and faculty --as well as the practicing financial professionals --attending the 
University of Dayton’s 13 th annual RISE forum.1  Before I became Chairman, I had the 
pleasure of addressing the 5th annu al forum as a member of the Board of Governors in 
2005.2  At that time, I spoke about the implementation of monetary policy and how 
crucial effective communication is to that implementation.  
Although I cannot join you in person this year, I note from the c onference agenda 
that you are hearing from two Federal Reserve Bank presidents --Charles Evans of 
Chicago and Dennis Lockhart of Atlanta --as well as former Federal Reserve Board Vice 
Chairman Roger Ferguson.  Effective communication in monetary policy is mo re 
important than ever, and I have little doubt that my current and former colleagues will 
provide you with insights about the Federal Reserve’s ongoing efforts to achieve the 
goals that the Congress has given us:  maximum employment and price stability.  
In my brief remarks today, I would like to mention another important mission of 
the Federal Reserve --promoting economic and financial knowledge among people of all 
ages and walks of life.  The Board in Washington and the 12 Federal Reserve Banks 
throughout the country are all deeply involved in economic education and supporting the 
work of teachers, schools, and national organizations.  For example, the Federal Reserve 
provides a financial and economic education website with a variety of resources for 
                                                 
1 RISE is Redefining Investm ent Strategy Education.  For more information, see 
www.udayton.edu/business/rise . 
2 See Ben S. Bernanke (2005), “Remarks by Governor Ben S. Bernanke,” speech delivered at the 
Redefining Investment Strategy Education Symposium, Dayton, Ohio, March 30, 
www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2005/20050330/default.htm .  - 2 - 
teache rs as well as for  students of various ages and levels of knowledge.3  The site offers 
educational games, classroom lesson plans, online publications, and multimedia 
tools.   Federal Reserve Banks offer professional development opportunities for teachers 
to improve their ability to present lessons on  personal finance topics.   A number of 
Reserve Banks also organize personal finance essay, video, and academ ic competitions 
for students.   And w e encourage students and teachers to visit Federal Reserve Bank 
learn ing centers and museums, which feature interactive exhibits about many aspects of 
banking, the financial system, and the economy.  
Among the lessons of the recent financial crisis is the need for virtually 
everyone --both young and old --to acquire a basic k nowledge of finance and economics.  
Such knowledge is necessary for anyone who will be faced with managing a household 
budget, making financial investments, finding reliable information about buying a car or 
house, and preparing financially for retirement and other life goals.  Accordingly, in 
addition to ensuring that students graduate with the financial literacy skills they need to 
navigate in the modern financial world, we, as a society, must also make sure that adults 
have opportunities to gain these sk ills or to refresh what they have learned.  Many of you 
are, or will be, practitioners in the financial services industry --perhaps serving retail 
clients --and in that capacity I hope you will make the promotion of financial and 
economic education a part of  your mission as well.  These skills not only help people 
provide a better life for themselves and their families, but, by deepening their 
understanding of the world economy, having such skills also helps equip them to be 
engaged citizens and informed vote rs.

Let me close by congratulating the University of Dayton for its leadership in 
hosting the RISE forum.  I hope this innovative program, which I’m told is the world’s 
largest student investment conference, succeeds in its ambitious goal of bringing toget her 
the current and future leaders of finance to focus on creating a better economic future.

The Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy  
  
 
Remarks by  
 
Janet L. Yellen  
 
Chair  
 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  
 
at 
 
The Economic Club of Washington 
 
Washington,  D.C.  
  
 
 
 
 
 
December 2, 2015  
  
Thank you to the Economic Club of Washington for inviting me to speak to you 
today.  I would like to offer my assessment of the U.S. econom y, nearly six and half 
years after the beginning of the current economic  expansion , and my view of the 
economic outlook.  I will describe the progress the economy has made toward the Federal 
Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) goals of maximum employment and st able prices 
and what the current situation and the outlook imply for how monetary policy is likely to 
evolve to best foster the attainment of those objectives.  
The Economic Outlook  
The U.S. economy has recovered substantially since the  Great Recession.  The 
unemployment rate, which peaked at 10 percent in October 2009, declined to 5 percent in October of this year.  At that level, the unemployment rate is near the median of FOMC 
participants’ most recent estimates of its longer -run norm al level.
1  The economy has 
created about 13 million jobs since the low point for employment in early 2010, and total 
nonfarm payrolls are now almost 4 -1/2 million higher than just prior to the recession.  
Most recently, after a couple months of relatively  modest payroll growth, employers 
added an estimated 271,000 jobs in October.  This increase brought the average monthly 
gain since June to about 195,000-- close to the monthly pace of around 210,000 in the first 
half of the year and still sufficient to be consistent with continued improvement in the 
labor market.   
Despite these substantial gains, we cannot yet, in my judgment, declare that the 
labor market has reached full employment.  Let me describe the basis for that view.   
                                                   
1 See table 1 in the Summary of Economic Projections , an addendum to the minutes of the September 2015 
FOMC meeting.  See Board of Governors (2015b).   - 2 - 
To begin with, I believe tha t a significant number of individuals now classified as 
out of the labor force would find and accept jobs in an even stronger labor market.  To be 
classified as unemployed, working- age people must report that they have actively sought 
work within the past four weeks.  Most of those not seeking work are appropriately not 
counted as unemployed.  These  includ e most retirees, teenagers  and young adults in 
school, and those  staying home to care f or children and other dependent family members.   
Even in a stronger  job market, it is likely that many of these individuals would choose not 
to work.   
But some who are counted as out of the labor force might be induced  to seek work 
if the likelihood of finding a job rose or if the expected pay was higher.  Examples here include people who had become too discouraged to search for work when the prospects 
for employment were poor and some who retired when their previous jobs ended.  In 
October, almost 2 million individuals classified as outside the labor force because they 
had not searched for work in the previous four weeks reported that they wanted and were 
available for work.  This is a considerable number of people, and some of them 
undoubtedly would be drawn back into the workforce as the labor market continued to 
streng then.  Likewise, some of those who report they don’t want to work now could 
change their minds in a stronger job market.    
Another margin of labor market slack not reflected in the unemployment rate 
consists of  individuals who report that they are working part time  but would prefer a full -
time job and  cannot find one --those classified as “part time for economic reasons.”  The 
share of such workers jumped from 3 percent of total employment prior to the Great 
Recession to around 6 -1/2 percent by 2010.  Since then, however, the share of these part  - 3 - 
time workers has fallen considerably and now is less than 4 percent of those employed.  
While this decline represents considerable progress, particularly given secular trends that 
over time may have increased the prev alence of part -time employment, I think some 
room remains for the hours of these workers to increase as the labor market improves 
further.   
The pace of increases in labor compensation provides another possible indicator, 
albeit an imperfect one, of the de gree of labor market slack.   Until recently labor 
compensation had grown only modestly, at average annual rates of around 2 to 2 -1/2 
percent .  More recently, however, we have seen a welcome pickup in the growth rate of 
average hourly earnings for all employees and of compensation per hour in the business 
sector.   While it is too soon to conclude whether these more rapid rates of increase will 
continue, a sustained pickup would likely signal a diminution of labor market slack.    
Turning to overall economic a ctivity, U.S. e conomic output --as measured by 
inflation -adjusted gross domestic product (GDP), or real GDP --has increased at a 
moderate pace, on balance, during the expansion.  Over the first three quarters of this year, real GDP is currently estimated to have advanced at an annual rate of 2 -1/4 percent, 
close to its average pace over the previous five years.  Many economic forecasters expect 
growth roughly along those same lines in the fourth quarter.   
Growth this year has been held down by weak net expor ts, which have subtracted 
more than 1/2 percentage point, on average, from the annual rate of real GDP growth over the past three quarters.  Foreign economic growth has slowed, damping increases in 
U.S. exports, and the U.S. dollar has appreciated substant ially since the middle of last 
year, making our exports more expensive and imported goods cheaper.    - 4 - 
By contrast, total real private domestic final purchases (PDFP) --which includes 
household spending, business fixed investment, and residential investment, and currently 
represents about 85 percent of aggregate spending--ha s increased at an annual rate of 
3 percent this year, significantly faster than real GDP.  Household spending growth has 
been particularly solid in 2015, with purchases of new motor vehicle s especially strong.  
Job growth has bolstered household income, and lower energy prices have left consumers 
with more to spend on other goods and services.  These same factors likely  have  
contributed to consumer confidence  that is more upbeat this year th an last year .  Increases 
in home values and stock market prices in recent years, along with reductions in debt, 
have pushed up the net worth of households, which also supports consumer spending.  Finally, interest rates for borrowers remain low, due in par t to the FOMC’s 
accommodative monetary policy, and these low rates appear to have been especially 
relevant for consumers considering the purchase of durable goods.
2 
Other components of PDFP, including residential and business investment, have 
also advanced  this year.  The same factors supporting consumer spending have supported 
further gains in the housing sector.  Indeed, gains in real residential investment spending 
have been faster so far in 2015 than last year, although the level of new residential 
construction still remains fairly low.  And outside of the drilling and mining sector, where 
lower oil prices have led to substantial cuts in outlays for new structures, business investment spending has posted moderate gains.  
 On balance, the moderate average pace of real GDP growth so far this year and 
over the entire expansion has been sufficient to help move the labor market close r to the

FOMC’s goal of maximum employment.  However, less progress  has been made on the 
second leg of our dual mandate --price sta bility --as inflation continues to run below the 
FOMC’s longer -run objective of 2 percent.  Overall consumer price inflation --as 
measured by the change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures --was 
only 1/4 percent  over the  12 months ending in October .  However , this number largely 
reflects the sharp fall in crude  oil prices since the  summer of 2014 that, in turn, has 
push ed down retail prices for gasoline  and other  consumer energy products.  Because 
food and energy prices are volatile, it is  often helpful to look at inflation excluding those 
two categories --known as core inflation--which is typically a better indicator of future 
overall inflation than recent readings of headline inflation.  But core inflation--which ran 
at 1-1/4 percen t over the 12 months ending in Oct ober--is also well below our 2 percent 
objective, partly reflecting the appreciation of the U.S. dollar.  The stronger dollar has 
pushed down the prices of imported goods, placing temporary downward pressure on 
core inflat ion.3  The plunge in crude oil prices may also have had some small indirect 
effects in holding down the prices of non -energy items in core inflation, as producers 
passed on to their customers some of the reductions in their energy- related costs.  Taking 
account of these effects, which may be holding down core inflation by around 1/4 to 
1/2 percentage point, it appears that the underlying rate of inflation in the United States 
has been running in the vicinity of 1 -1/2 to 1- 3/4 percent.    
Let me now turn to w here I see the economy is likely headed over the next several 
years.  To summarize, I anticipate continued economic growth at a moderate pace that 
will be sufficient to generate additional increases in employment, further reductions in

the remaining margin s of labor market slack, and a rise in inflation to our 2 percent 
objective.  I expect that the fundamental factors supporting domestic spending that I have 
enumerated today will continue to do so, while the drag from some of the factors that 
have been wei ghing on economic growth should begin to lessen next year.  Although  the 
economic outlook, as always, is uncertain, I currently see the risks to the outlook for 
economic activity and the labor market as very close to balanced.  
Turning to the factors that have been holding down growth, as I already noted, the 
higher foreign exchange value of the dollar, as well as weak growth in some foreign economies, has restrained the demand for U.S. exports over the past year.  In addition, 
lower crude oil prices have reduced activity in the domestic oil sector.  I anticipate that the drag on U.S. economic growth from these factors will diminish in the next couple of 
years as the global economy improves and the adjustment to prior declines in oil prices is 
completed.   
Although developments in foreign economies still pose risks to U.S. economic 
growth that we are monitoring, these downside risks from abroad have lessened since late summer.  Among emerging market economies, recent data support the view that the 
slowdown in the Chinese economy, which has received considerable attention, will likely 
continue to be modest and gradual.  China has taken actions to stimulate its economy this 
year and could do more if necessary.  A number of other  emerging market economies 
have eas ed monetary and fiscal policy this year , and economic activity in these 
economies has improved of late.  Accommodative monetary policy is also supporting 
economic growth in the advanced economies.  A pickup in demand in many advanced  - 7 - 
economies and a stabil ization in commodity prices should, in turn,  boost the growth 
prospects of emerging market economies.   
A final positive development for the outlook that I will mention relates to fiscal 
policy.  This year the effect of federal fiscal policy on real GDP gr owth has been roughly 
neutral, in contrast to earlier years in which the expiration of stimulus programs and 
fiscal policy actions to reduce the federal budget deficit created significant drags on 
growth .4  Also, the budget situation for many state and loc al governments has improved 
as the economic expansion has increased the revenues of these governments, allowing 
them to increase their hiring and spending after a number of years of cuts in the wake of 
the Great Recession.  Looking ahead, I anticipate that  total real government purchases of 
goods and services should have a modest positive effect on economic growth over the next few years.
5   
Regarding U.S. inflation, I anticipate that the drag from the large declines in 
prices for crude oil and imports over  the past year  and a half will diminish next year.  
With less downward pressure on inflation from these factors and some upward pressure 
from a further tightening in U.S. labor and product markets, I expect inflation to  move up 
to the FOMC’s 2 percent obje ctive over the next few years.  Of course , inflation 
expectations play an important role in the inflation process , and my forecast of a return to 
our 2 percent objective over the medium term relies on a judgment  that longer -term 
inflation expectations remain reasonably well anchored.  In this regard,  recent measures 
                                                   
4 The C ongressional B udget O ffice estimates that current federal fiscal policies will have little effect on 
economic growth this year, but that earlier fiscal policy actions reduced the rate of real GDP growth 
roughly 1- 1/2 percentage points in 2013 and about 1/4 percentage point in 2014 relative to what it would 
have been otherwise.  See Congressional Budget Office  (2015a) .

from the Survey of P rofessional Forecasters, the Blue Chip Economic Indicators, and the 
Survey of Primary Dealers  have continued to be generally stable.  The measure of longer -
term inflation  expectations from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, in 
contrast, has lately edged below its typical range  in recent years.  However , this measure 
often seems to respond modestly, though temporarily, to large changes in actual inflation, 
and the very low readings on headline inflation over the past year may help  explain some  
of the recent decline in the Michigan measure .6  Market -based measures of inflation 
compensation have moved up some in recent weeks after declining to historically low 
levels earlier in the fall .  While the low level of these measures appears to reflect, at least 
in part, changes in risk and liquidity premiums, we will continue to monitor this 
development closely.  Convincing evidence that longer -term inflation expectation s have 
moved lower would be a concern because declines in consumer and business expectations about inflation could put downward pressure on actual inflation, making the attainment of 
our 2 percent inflation goal more difficult.    
Monetary  Policy  
Let me now  turn to the implications of the economic outlook for monetary policy.  
Reflecting progress toward the Committee’s objectives, m any FOMC participants 
indicated in September that they anticipated, in light of their economic forecasts at the 
time, that it wo uld be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate by the 
end of this year.   Some  participants projected  that it would be appropriate to wait until 
later to raise the target funds rate range,  but all agreed that the timing of a rate in crease 
                                                   
6 For example, the University of Michigan survey measure of longer -term inflation expectations was 
temporarily elevated relative to its usual range in 2008 when crude oil and other commodity prices spiked 
and pushed up actual headline inflation for a time.  - 9 - 
would depend on what the incoming data tell us about the economic outlook and the 
associated risks  to that outlook .   
In the policy statement issued after its October meeting, the FOMC  reaffirmed its 
judgment  that it would be appropriate to increase  the target range for the federal funds 
rate when we had seen some further improvement in the labor market and were 
reasonably confident that inflation would move back to the Committee’s  2 percent 
objective over the medium term.  That initial rate increase  would reflect the Committee’s 
judgment , based on a range of indicators , that the economy would continue to grow at a 
pace sufficient to generate further labor market improvement  and a return of inflation to 
2 percent, even after the reduction in policy ac commodation.   As I have already noted, I 
currently judge  that U.S. econom ic growth  is likely to be sufficient over the next year or 
two to result in further improvement  in the labor market .  Ongoing gains in the labor 
market, coupled with my judgment that longer -term inflation expectations remain 
reasonably well anchored, serve to bolster my confidence in a return of inflation to 
2 percent as the disinflationary effects of declines in energy and import prices wane.  
Committee participants recognize that the future course of the economy is  
uncertain, and we take account of both the upside and downside risks around our 
projections when judging the appropriate stance of monetary policy.  In particular, recent  
monetary policy decisions have reflected  our recognit ion that, with the federal funds rate 
near zero, we can respond more readily to upside surprises to inflation, economic growth, and employment than to downside shocks.  This asymmetry suggests that it is appropriate 
to be more cautious in raising our targe t for the federal funds rate than would be the case  - 10 - 
if short -term nominal interest rates were appreciably above zero.7  Reflecting these 
concerns, we have maintained our current policy stance even as the labor market has 
improved appreciably.   
However, we  must also take into account the well -documented lags in the effects 
of monetary policy.8  Were the FOMC to delay the start of policy normalization for too 
long, we would likely end up having to tighten policy relatively abruptly to keep the 
economy from s ignificantly overshooting both of our goals.  Such an abrupt tightening 
would risk disrupting financial markets and perhaps even inadvertently push the economy 
into recession.  Moreover, holding the federal funds rate at its current level for too long 
could also encourage excessive risk -taking and thus undermine financial stability.    
On balance, economic and financial information received since our October 
meeting has been consistent with our expectations of continued improvement in the labor 
market.  And , as I have noted, continuing improvement in the labor market help s 
strengthen confidence that inflation will move back to our 2 percent objective over the medium term.  That said, between today and the next FOMC meeting, we will receive 
additional data tha t bear on the economic outlook.   These data include  a range of 
indicators regarding the labor market, inflation, and economic activity.  When my colleagues and I meet, we will assess all of the available data and their implications for 
the economic outlook in making our p olicy decision .   
                                                   
7 See, for example, Adam and Billi (2007), Nakata (2012), and Evans and others (2015).  
8 Milton Friedman famously concluded that “monetary actions affect economic conditions only after a lag 
that is both long and variable” (1961, p. 447).  Evidence that monetary policy affects inflation with a lag 
comes in part from vector autoregressions in which monetary policy shocks have been identified under a 
variety of identification assumptions.  See, for example, Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (2005) and Uhlig (2005).   - 11 - 
As you know, t here has  been considerable focus on the first increase in the federal 
funds rate after nearly seven years in which that rate has been at  its effective lower 
bound .  We have tried to be as clear as possible ab out the considerations that will affect 
that decision.  Of course, even after the initial increase in the federal funds rate, monetary 
policy will remain accommodative.  And it bears emphasi zing that what matters for the 
economic outlook are the public’s e xpectations concerning the path of the federal funds 
rate over time:  It is those expectations that affect financial conditions and thereby influence spending and investment decisions .  In this regard, the Committee anticipates 
that even after employment a nd inflation are near mandate -consistent levels, economic 
conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run .   
This expectation is consistent with an implicit assessmen t that the neutral  nominal 
federal funds rate --defined as the value of the federal funds rate that would be neither 
expansionary nor contractionary if the economy were operating near its potential --is 
currently low by historical standards and is likely to ris e only gradually over time.  One 
indication that the neutral funds rate is unusually low is that U.S. economic growth has 
been quite modest in recent years despite the very low level of the federal funds rate and 
the Federal Reserve’s very large holdings of longer -term securities.  Had the neutral rate 
been running closer to the levels that are thought to have prevailed prior to the financial 
crisis, current monetary policy settings would have been expected to foster a very rapid 
economic expansion, with  inflation likely rising significantly above our 2 percent 
objective.   - 12 - 
Empirical support for the judgment that the neutral federal funds rate is low 
comes from both academic research and Federal Reserve staff analysis.  Figure 1 
employs four macroeconomic m odels used by Federal Reserve staff to estimate the 
“natural” real rate of interest, a concept closely related to the neutral rate.9  The measures 
of the natural rate shown in th is figure represent the real  short -term interest rate that 
would prevail in the absence of frictions that slow the adjustment of wages and prices to 
changes in the economy; under a variety of assumptions, this interest rate has been shown 
to promote full employment.10  The shaded blue band represents the range of the 
estimates of the natural real rate at each point in time.  This analysis suggests that the natural real rate fell sharply with the onset of the crisis and has recovered only partially.  
These findings are broadly consisten t with those reported in a paper by Thomas Laubach 
and John Williams, shown in figure 2.
11   
                                                   
9 Note that these estimates are in real terms; to obtain estimates of the nominal natural interest rate, one 
would add a measure of expected inflation.  The four models used are (1) a dynamic stochastic general 
equilibrium (DSGE) model developed by the staff of the Federal Reserve Board and described in Kiley 
(2013); (2) a DSGE model developed by the staff of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and described 
in Del Negro and others (2013); (3) a DSGE model developed by the staff of the Federal Reserve Board based on Christiano, Motto, and Rostagno (2014); and (4) a DSGE model developed by the staff of the Federal Reserve Board based on Guerrieri and Iacoviello (201 3 [rev. 2014] ). 
10 The concept of the natural  rate goes back to Wicksell, who defined it as the rate that “tends neither to 
raise nor to lower” (1936 [1898] , p. 102)  commodity prices.  Wicksell posited that the natural rate would be 
equal to the real interest rate that would balance supply and demand absent monetary frictions.  The recent 
academic literature draws on this notion to define the natural rate as t he real interest rate that would prevail 
in the absence of sluggish adjustment in nominal prices and wages.  In simple models, this interest rate 
would result in stable prices and full employment; in some more complex models, this interest rate has 
been found to promote stable inflation and appropriate economic activity, although monetary policymakers face important tradeoffs in such settings.  Importantly, the natural rate varies over time.  For example, it 
generally rises with expected productivity growth and wit h “preference shocks” that capture households’ 
desire to consume today rather than save.  For further discussion of the potential usefulness of the natural 
rate for monetary policy, see, for example, Barsky, Justiniano, and Melosi (2014) and Cúrdia and others 
(2015).  By contrast, Laubach and Williams (2015) employ a statistical approach that defines the natural 
rate as one consistent with the economy operating at its full potential once transitory shocks to aggregate 
supply and demand have abated.  These t wo approaches to the measurement of  the natural real rate are 
different  but have important similarities.   Qualitatively, the two measures would be expected to move 
together  in response to s hocks to productivity growth and preference s so long as those shocks were very 
persistent.   
11 See Laubach and Williams (2015).  - 13 - 
The marked decline in the neutral federal funds rate after the crisis may be 
partially attributable to a range of persistent economic headwinds that have weighed on 
aggregate demand.  These headwinds have include d tighter underwriting standards and 
limited  access to credit for some borrowers, deleveraging by many households to reduce 
debt burdens, contractionary fiscal policy at all levels of government , weak growth 
abroad coupled with a significant appreciation of the dollar, slower productivity and labor 
force growth,  and elevated uncertainty about the economic outlook.12  As the restraint 
from these headwinds further abate s, I anticipate that the neutral  federal fun ds rate will 
gradually move higher over time.  Indeed, in September, most FOMC participants 
projected that, in the long run, the nominal federal funds rate would be near 3.5 percent , 
and that the actual federal funds rate would rise to that level fairly sl owly .13   
Because the value of the neutral federal funds rate is not directly measureable and 
must be estimated based on our imperfect understanding of the economy and the 
available data, I would stress that considerable uncertainty attends  our estimates of  its 
current level and even more to its likely path going forward.14  That said, we will learn 
                                                   
12 For analyses of how a sudden tightening in access to credit can lead to household deleveraging, pushing 
down the neutral rate of interest, see Eggertsson and Krugman (2012) and Guerrieri and Lorenzoni (2015). 
13 See figure 2 in the Summary of Economic Projections, an addendum to the minutes of the September 
2015 FOMC meeting.  See Board of Governors (2015b).  T he longer -run normal level of the federal funds 
rate reported in the SEP presumably mat ches p articipants ’ assessment of the neutral nominal federal funds 
rate that will prevail in the longer run .  Between June 2012 and September 2015 the median of FOMC 
participants’ estimates of the longer -run level of the federal funds rate declined 75 basi s point s, to 3.5 
percent.   When revising down their estimates of the longer -run federal funds rate, participants have 
generally cited a lower assessment of the economy’s longer -run potential growth rate as a contributing 
factor.  
14 One source of uncertainty  regarding the neutral federal funds rate is so -called model uncertainty.  As 
shown in figure 1, a variety of models that provide plausible descriptions of the economy give somewhat 
different estimates of the neutral rate.  A second source of uncertainty i s the limited sample size of relevant 
macroeconomic data:  Our estimates of the neutral federal funds rate represent inferences about a moving target.  As a result, although the data provide important signals about the neutral rate, our estimates are neces sarily imprecise.  In Laubach and Williams (2003), for example, the standard error of the estimate of 
the neutral rate in one baseline model was about 2 percentage points on average.  Moreover, one -sided  - 14 - 
more from observing economic developments in the period ahead.  It  is thereby important 
to emphasize that the actual path of monetary policy will depend on how in coming data 
affect the evolution of the economic outlook.  Stronger growth or a more rapid increase in  
inflation than we currently anticipate  would suggest that the neutral federal funds rate is 
rising more quickly than expected, making it appropriate to r aise the federal funds rate 
more quickly as well; conversely , if the economy disappoints, the federal funds rate 
would likely rise more slowly.  Given the persistent shortfall in inflation from our 
2 percent objective, the Committee will, of course, carefully monitor actual progress 
toward our inflation goal as we make decisions over time on the appropriate path for the 
federal funds rate.  
In closing, let me again thank the Economic Club of Washington for this 
opportunity to speak about the economy and monetary policy.  The economy has come a 
long way toward the FOMC’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.  
When the Committee  begins to normalize the stance of policy, doing so will be a 
testament, also,  to how far our economy has come in recovering f rom the effects of the 
financial crisis and the Great Recession.  In that sense, it is a day that I expect we all are looking forw ard to.  
  
                                                   
estimates of the neutral rate--those available to policymakers, based only on data known at the time --are 
generally noisier than estimates of the neutral rate at some previous time that incorporate all the data 
available.    - 15 -

Good afternoon, everyone.  T hank you to Montana State University  (MSU)  for 
hosting t oday’s  event  and for that very kind introduction.  It is wonderful to see the 
success of your  Community Banking Program  here at MSU and  your  commitment to 
investing in the education of future  generations  of community bankers.  
Throughout the response to the pandemic, community bankers have continued to 
serve as the primary source of credit to small businesses and have continued to provide 
economic and financial support to communities across our nation.  Y oung people , like all 
of you engaged in this program , will very likely become the future leaders of these 
institutions , which are critical to their communities and to our economy and financial 
system .   
One of the most significant challenges facing communi ty bankers today is 
navigating the complex regulatory framework.  One area that has become more 
complicated is a line of business  that has traditionally been  the foundation for community 
banking, home mortgage  lending.  Community bank leaders consistently tell me that 
significant regulatory burden related to making home mortgages has been a major reason they have scaled back their mortgage lending activities or exited the market altogether. Along with tightened lending standards, this trend has made it harder for middle - and 
lower -income borrowers to obtain mortgage credit since the global financial crisis.  
Fortunately, work is under  way to relieve that burden, and I will highlight one 
effort in particular.  But before I do, let me provide some  context by re viewing the 
current state of the economy and its effect on homeowners and would- be homeowners . 
The COVID- 19 Pandemic and Homeownership in the U.S.   - 2 - 
The COVID -19 pandemic is having a profound effect on individuals and families 
across the U.S. and throughout the world.  While a strong recovery has begun, it is clear 
that there is still a way to go before we are back to the robust economy we experienced at 
the beginning of the year.  These challenges are affecting h omeowners and the lenders 
that provide credit to support them .  Many homeowners who have lost a job or have had 
their income affected by economic conditions  have been able to work with their le nders, 
but such help may not be a long- term solution for many borrowers.  
Fortunately, the housing market as a whole is a bright spot for the economy.  
Higher home prices are  improving the bal ance sheets of many households , even those 
that may face income a nd employment challenges, and new construction activity is 
generating new job opportunities .  While affordability remains a n important  
consideration, it is encouraging that housing has performed well in response to low interest rates.   
Mortgage Regulations  and Access to Mortgage Credit  
However, e ven during this period of strong performance in the housing market, 
access to affordable mortgage credit remains a barrier to homeownership for some  
borrowers , due in part to regulatory burden.  Since the last financial crisis more than a 
decade ago, there have been a number  of new mortgage regulations  that added 
requirements for both borrowers and lenders .  While many of these requirements have 
contributed to a safer and more consumer -friendly mortgage market, they have also 
introduced significant paperwork and delays that can present roadblocks for many 
borrowers.  These new rules have also made it more difficult and costly for small banks  - 3 - 
to originate  mortgage loans, leading many community banks  to scale back on home 
lending activity or abandon it altogether.   
Homeownership is as important to communities as it is to individuals , and access 
to credit for rural and low -to-moderate income communities often depends on community 
banks.  In many communities , especially rural communities, if the local bank has been 
forced out of mortgage lending due to burdensome regulation, it means little or no access 
to mortgage credit, preventing buyers from financing home purchases and homeowners 
from selling their homes .     
Many leaders of small community banks  have told me that the c ompliance cost s 
for originating smaller  mortgages  are prohibitive , and that the staffing and training 
required to meet the strict requirements are extraordinary in relation to the limited 
number of mortgages they originate .  As one state banking commissioner said to me 
recently, “ It doesn’t make a lot of sense that you can make an $80,000 truck loan on two 
sides of a sheet of paper, but that many, many pages of paperwork are req uired to make a 
$40,000 loan on a mobile home  or trailer.”    
In fact, I have been told by c ommunity bankers that they are sometimes 
compelled to make loans for lower -priced  home purchases that are backed by other 
collateral, such as a car or equipment, because of the excessive burden of complying with the many residential home mortgage regulations and time  frames for such small 
transactions.  As a result, these consumers may not have the benefit of the important consumer protections that having a home mortgage loan provides.  
Reducing mortgage compliance burden w ould allow community banks to better 
meet the critical need for home lending in their communities.   Because of their local  - 4 - 
knowledge and strong customer relationships, community banks  are often more w illing to 
work with borrowers to get through difficult times .  Taking steps to simplify and lower 
this regulatory burden for  small community banks and their customers  would help to 
ensure that homeowners can stay in their homes during times of stress, like the one we 
are facing currently due to COVID- 19.  
One Area to Consider in Easing B urden 
The TILA -RESPA Integrated Disclosure, or TRID, is one of the real estate 
regulatory requirements that smaller banks cite most frequently as creating  a heavy 
burde n.  Commissioner Melanie Hall and the Montana Independent Bankers have been 
particularly helpful  in highlighting the importance of this issue.  Therefore, I am very 
pleased that the Independent C ommunity B ankers of A merica is  engaged in ongoing 
conversations and activities to address the more burdensome aspects of this requirement  
on community banks  while importantly retaining key consumer protections.  Efforts like 
these that aim to reduce the compliance burden for critically important services will 
enable  many community banks to return to doing  what they do best: meet ing the needs of 
their communities.  
Again, thank you for inviting me to join you today, and I look forward to 
engaging on this important topic.

Creating a New Model for the Future of Supervision   
 
 
 
Remarks by  
Michelle W. Bowman  
Member  
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  
at the  
Community Banking in the 21
st Century Research and Policy Conference  
St. Louis, Missouri  
(virtual conference)  
     
 
 
September  28, 2021 Good afternoon.  I’m pleased to be able to join you again  virtually for this year’s  
Community Banking in the 21st Century  research and policy conference.  Although I think 
we would all prefer to be together in person, in the shadow of the  St. Louis Arch, I’m 
optimistic that next year (which will be the 10th anniversary of the conference, by the 
way) will give us the opportunity to finally  gather in person a fter a two-year hiatus.  
For nine years, this conference, which brings together researchers, regulators, and 
community bankers, has enabled us to hear from top academics around the world who  
conduct research to help us better understand the community bank business model .  It’s 
not an accident that this conference is sponsored by three agencies involved in the 
supervision of banks —the Fed eral Reserve, the Conference of State Bank Supervisors , 
and the FDIC —as the work of this conference has informed , and will continue to i nform, 
how we think about the supervision of our nation’s community banks. 
Our conference sponsors entered this partnership with the belief that what we 
learn here will deepen our understanding of  the benefits of , and the challenges facing, the 
community bank business model, which, in turn, helps  to make us better bank 
supervisors.  
It’s natural then to ask : What have we learned from this conf erence that is 
applicable t oday? What  might we apply in the future to the supervis ion of community 
banks?  
To answer that question, or quite frankly, to answer many questions that pertain to 
the regulation and supervision of banks, it’s instructive to first go back a bit in history .  In 
this case, I’d like to take you all the way back to. . . 2019. 
Seems like a lifetime ago.  - 2 - 
 
 
 Way b ack then, we were concerned about liquidity.  Banks were concerned about 
a potential run- off of  deposits as consumers found new, more technology -centric ways to 
manage their money, often outside of the insured banking system .  Although we also saw 
a decline in technology costs  that enabled banks of al l sizes to offer a wider array of 
digital products and services to their customers , the innovation taking place outside the 
banking sector was often  seen as outpacing the innovation in the banking sector.  
Consumers seemed to increasingly weigh convenience over safety, as a number of 
non-banks increas ed their market share .  To a lesser degree, but st ill concerning, was that 
of the convenience factor .  It drove some small business borrowers to move away from 
lenders with whom they had longstanding relationships .  In some cases, those borrowers 
were even willing to pay much more for credit for the sake of convenience.  
Unfortunately, some borrowers learned the hard way that convenience  does not always 
outweigh a banking relationship —particularly when a business or community 
experiences a significant hardship such as a natural disaster.  
I regularly hear d stories of how small businesses that borrowed from an online 
lender were unable to reach anyone to discuss their situation during a crisis and 
ultimately had their loans called because of  missing a payment .  In these situations, I also 
heard stories of how the  local community bank that underst ood the local situation and 
want ed to see the business and the community survive, w ould step in, and refinan ce the 
original loan  to help the small business return to more normal operations.  
I also heard about challenges with core processors and how legacy contracts and a 
lack of competition for core processing services was stifling innovation .  We saw several 
fintechs become “ mainstream ” nationally , and we saw a proliferation of technology - 3 - 
 
 
 solutions targeted at helping community banks be come nimbler  in adding new products 
and services.  
From a supervisory perspective, the Federal Reserve actively explor ed ways to 
reduce regulatory burden and provide greater transparency into the work of bank 
supervisors .  Using research presented in prior years at this conference, we applied 
findings showing the disproportionate regulatory burden borne by our smallest institutions and looked across our processes to find ways to tailor our supervisory model 
to more accurately reflect the risk posed by these  smaller financial institutions.  
And then came March 2020 and the  arrival of the COVID- 19 pandemic in the 
U.S. 
Despite the many choices consumers have for  manag ing their money and 
purchases outside of the traditional banking system, we witnessed a systematic flight to the safety of FDIC -insured deposits in state or nationally chartered banks .   
Specifically, total d eposits at all FDIC -insured institutions increased by  22 
percent when comparing deposit data from 2019 to 2020.
1  Small business lending also 
increased  significantly .  From the end of 2019 to the end of the second quarter of 2020 
alone , small loans to businesses at community banks, a proxy for small business lending, 
increased by 39 percent.2   
The Impact of the PPP during the Pandemic  
One driver for the increase in small business lending was, of course, the Small 
Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program or PPP.  The PPP was funded 
 
1 FDIC Summary of Deposits (2019, 2020). Summary of Deposits is collected as of the second quarter each 
year.

 by the U .S. Treasury Department through forgivable loans that enabled small businesses 
to maintain payroll, retain employees who may have been laid off in response to the 
social dista ncing protocols that went into effect in April 2020, or to cover other overhead 
costs.   
To support the PPP, the Federal Reserve provided a liquidity backstop to PPP 
lenders through its Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility or PPPLF .  In 
recogniti on of the evolution in the banking landscape that I referenced a few moments 
ago, the PPPLF was designed to not only provide a liquidity backstop to banks and credit 
unions, but also to serve  non- bank fintechs, community development financial 
institutions , and agricultural finance companies  that participated in the PPP .  Given the 
important role minority -owned banks play in the allocation of credit in their 
communities, the Federal Reserve also actively engaged minority depository institutions to ensure the y had the tools they needed to benefit from the Fed’s emergency liquidity 
programs.  
To be sure, t he PPP and the PPPLF will provide significant research material for 
years to come.  I understand from reviewing the papers accepted into this year’s proceedings  that it has already driven  the work of several economists you’ll be hearing 
from over this two -day conference .  In reviewing the data on these programs, however —
and here I must cr edit the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s “Supervision 
Transformational Trends”  program —we see that a substantial majority of PPP loan s, 
nearly 73 percent, were made by insured depository institutions .  These loans also 
accounted for nearly 90 percent of the aggregated loan amount for all PPP loans.  - 5 - 
 
 
 Getting a bit more granular, we can see that community banks made 32 percent of 
all PPP loans while large banks made 35 percent of all PPP loans , with credit unions and 
savings banks  accounting for the rest of the loans made by banking institutions .  Fintechs 
accounted for approximately 13 percent of all PPP loans and more than half of th ose were 
made as a result of  a partner bank relationship.  
A recent working paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) 
offers additional detail  on the roles these different types of lender s played in allocating 
credit through the PPP  during the pandemic .3  The authors found 
• Community banks originated the majority of PPP  loans when the program first 
launched, while large banks  were the majority lender during the second phase of 
the program .4 
• Community banks provided more loans to middle income borrowers while large 
banks provided more PPP loans to upper income borrowers . 
• Community banks and large banks made loans to lower and moderate -income  
borrowers in approximately equal  proportions.  
• Fintech firms, on the other hand, made more loans in zip codes with fewer bank 
branches, lower incomes , and larger minority populations .5 
• The authors also found that fintech lending, instead of  taking market share from 
traditional banks, mostly expanded the overall supply of credit and other financial 
services.

Protection Program ,” NBER Working Paper 27659  (Cambridge: National Bureau of Economic Research , 
December 2020 ), https://www.nber.org/papers/w27659 . 
4 It’s important to note that the NBER paper uses $20 billion as the asset size threshold between large banks 
and small (community) banks. This is different than the $10 billion asset size threshold that was established 
via the 2010 Dodd -Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.  
5 In this study, lending by Minority Depository Institutions and Community Development Financial 
Institutions is included in the lending data for small (community) banks.  - 6 - 
 
 
 From my perspective , these findings  offer evidence of the continuing importance of 
community banks to our economy during both “normal” times  as well as during times of 
extreme financial stress.  Or, to paraphrase Mark Twain, “reports of the demise of 
community banks are greatly exaggerated .” 
The N BER paper also highlight s how new entrants to banking can meet an unmet 
need .   
The experience s of banks and bank supervisors during the pandemic also offer 
insights into how we should think about the Federal Reserve’s approach to supervision in 
the future.  For the remainder of my talk, I will offer my thoughts on a key principle  that I 
believe should guide our thinking : The future of community banking and the future of 
banking supervision are  deeply  inter connected . 
My earlier comments should not be interpreted as  suggesting that there aren’t real 
challenges facing the community bank business model .  But I am suggesting that new 
technologies, new entrants into banking, and changes in customer preferences  that have 
led to predictions about the end of the community banking business model simply have 
not been substantiated.  
If anything, this conference has highlighted that the diversity in business models 
of small financial institutions is an essential  part of our economy.  T here is strength in 
being small that enables institutions to know their customers on a much deeper level .  
Small financial institutions can quickly customize products and services to address their customers’ needs and, in some cases, they can leverage the flexibility  of their business 
models to take advantage of new business opportunities .  This flexibility allows banks to  
maintain  strong relationships with customers —particularly those customers who don’t fit - 7 - 
 
 
 a “typical ” borrower profile .  It also explains  why c ommunity banks have a long history 
of providing essential financial services to households, small businesses, and small farms 
in communities across the country.   
During the pandemic, I personally began s peak ing to the leaders of the more than 
650 state member community banks in the Federal Reserve’s supervisory portfolio .  The 
conversations  to date  have provided important regional insights and perspectives that can 
only be glean ed from leaders who  know their mar kets and customers at a very deep level .  
While I heard that lobby traffic was down and that lending opportunities were not as 
robust as they once were, I mostly heard optimism .  I heard that the value proposition of 
the traditional community bank was on full display in many communities, urban and rural.  I heard that bank business customers needed banker s who truly knew them and 
their business es, and who could work with them to provide the customized support the y 
needed during that time of great uncertain ty. 
As banks changed to meet the challenges of the pandemic, we ask ed ourselves at 
the Federal Reserve, do bank supervisors need to change?  
By necessity, t he immediate answer, of course, was “yes.”   The Federal Reserve 
did so by pausing all on- site exams and using technology t hat enabled us to remotely 
supervise the safety and soundness o f our institutions as well as monitor their compliance 
with relevant consumer compliance laws and regulations .  To be sure, w e adjusted our 
supervisory expectations accordingly based on the guidance we were providing banks. 
We also greatly expanded our outreach and engagement with financial 
institution s.  We deployed the full range of communications tools that we’ve developed 
over many years to provide banks with real -time information on supervisory expectations  - 8 - 
 
 
 as well as the emergency lending programs that were put in place to forestall any 
systematic deterioration in the health of our financial system.  
As evidenced by the continued strength of  bank balance sheets and the general 
absence of bank failures during the pandemic, I think we can confidently  say that the 
actions of banks , bank supervisors , and policymakers during the pandemic allowed us to 
avoid the challenges that plague d our banking system during 2008 financial crisis .  The 
pandemic heightened our awareness of this important linkage betwe en banking and 
supervision.   
Had we not tailored our supervisory approach during the pandemic, I believe the 
impact on our banks, our economy, and on consumers would have been much more severe.   
From the beginning, we worked closely with our federal and state counterparts —
many of whom are represented at this conference —to develop a sense of joint action and 
to agree to work t ogether in a holistic way.  
I knew from my experience as both a community banker and a state bank 
regulator, that we needed to avoid overreacting and instead approach supervision in a more  measured way that allowed banks the flexibility to work with their c ustomers .  We 
needed to empower banks to manage those key relationships in their loan portfolios in a way that was beneficial to their customers without exposing the banks to risk.  
What we saw, as a result of this approach, is that the industry made respon sible 
decisions that kept credit flowing throughout the pandemic and enabled businesses across the U.S . to continue operating.  -9 -
But the question r emains: how should supervisors, and banking supervision itself, 
apply what we learned going forward?  During the pandemic, we changed our 
supervisory approaches based on necessity, but now we need to look ahead and make 
sure that we’re adjusting our supervisory model in ways that al low banks greater 
flexibility to i nnovate t o compete in today’s quickly evolving banking environment—
without sacrificing  important consumer protections  or the health and safety of our 
banking system. 
The Fut ure of  Supe rvision  
To start, we must acknowledge the interconnectedness of t he future of banking 
and the future of bank supervision.  Supervision has to evolve because the banking 
industry is evolving.  A vailable technology,  analytical capa bilities, and cu stomer and  
workforce p references a re driving  this evoluti on in how financial sector products and 
services a re delivered.  We recognize that our workforce, processes, and technology 
must align w ith these chan ges to ensure that an effective, transparent, and timely 
supervision p rogram is maintained.    
Therefore, the Federal R eserve  is embarking  on an i nitiative  to investigate the 
implications of these changes for the Federal R eserve’s Supervision function.6 
The goal of this in itiative is to ensure our supervisory approache s accommodat e a 
much broader range of activities while ensuri ng we don’t create an un level playing  field 
with unfair advantages, or unfair disadvantage s, for  some types of  firms versus others.   
6 The scope includes execution of safety and soundness and consumer compliance supervision, risk 
identification, and analytical activities. The scope excludes other System Supervision activities , such as 
training, applications, enforcement, and policymaking.  - 10 - 
 
 
 This will include investigating technology and innovative business practices that increase 
our agility and efficiency .    
Innovation is a way of life for banks, it should be for supervisors as well.  
But we must do this in a way that also pr eserves what we know works and what 
we learned can work during the pandemic.  
Before sharing my views on the underlying principles that need to guide our 
thinking on our future supervisory approaches, I’ll first offer some thoughts on a few aspects of Federal Reserve supervision that I believe  must be preserved even as we think 
expansively about the future:  
1. The first being the Federal Reserve’s Supervisory s tructure .  Although the 
Fed’s supervision and regulation of banks is the responsibility of the Board of Governors, the day- to-day supervision of banks is delegated to the Reserve 
Banks .  This distributed system ensures we have most of  our examination  
work force living and working in the same communities served by our community 
banks .  This structure , perhaps more importantly, gives our examiners deep 
insights into thousands of local economies across the U.S. and  helps us 
understand the local industries that are vital to the long -term health and success of 
these communities.  This local knowledge is what enables our examiners to tailor  
our supervision of institutions based not only on the complexity of the bank but  
based on the unique characteristics of the industries they support . 
2. The second is the Federal Reserve’s d irect outreach and e ngagement with 
banks and f inancial institutions .  Since the 2008 financial crisis, the Federal 
Reserve has built an extensive communications infrastructure —through national - 11 - 
 
 
 programs , such as Ask the Fed ®, and though hundreds of local Reserve Bank 
programs —to share important supervisory and regulatory information  with ba nks.  
The goal was simple: provide a mechanism that enables us to quickly share 
information and perspectives with institutions outside of the exam process, provide timely and accurate responses to questions, and give the banks the tools they need to meet o ur supervisory expectations .  I believe supervision works best 
when supervisors clearly communicate their expectations with banks —there 
shouldn’t be any “surprises” about our expectations during an exam .  In my calls 
with bankers, I’ m reminded that one of the biggest sources of regulatory burden is 
regulatory and supervisory uncertainty .  By clearly communicating our 
expectations, by engaging the industry directly to understand the impact of these expectations and, when appropriate, pr oviding banks with tools and resources to 
meet those expectations, we reduce uncertainty for banks . 
We continued to expand our  communication approach this past July with the 
launch of the Federal Reserve’s Scaled CECL Allowance for Losses Estimator or SCAL E tool .  SCALE gives community banks a tangible tool to help with their 
calculation of loan loss allowance under the Current Expected Credit Losses 
methodology.  Our effort to identify simple and practical way s to implement 
CECL that would help reduce cost s and complexity for smaller community banks 
was supported by the Financial Accounting Standards Board.  The launch of 
SCALE represents a significant cultural shift in how we intend to supervise in the future: when there is significant uncertainty around a new regulation, supervisory - 12 - 
 
 
 expectation, or practice , we will look beyond our traditional communications 
tools to find innovative ways to reduce that uncertainty.  
So, what will this new  approach to supervision look like  and what princi ples will 
guide us?  
• First, we must maintain a firm commitment to preserving the stability, integrity, 
functionality, and diversity of our banking system. 
• Second, we must maintain consumer protection as  we innovate  and ensure that 
banks can safely offer financial products and services that consumers demand and are uniquely tailored to their circumstances and goals . 
• Third, as we adjust our supervisory approach, we must avoid adding new burdens on banks, particularly on those that maintain a more traditional business model.  We must be consistent in how we view similar activities at similar institutions , but 
our approach must also allow for  de novo banks  and allow for greater innovation 
at our nation’s banks. And we nee d to continue to provide examiners with the 
ability to tailor their expectations based on the risks posed by individual institution s.  We must move even further  beyond the “one size fits all” 
supervisory model that defined our approach in the past.  
• Fourth, we must enhance transparency around our supervisory expectations  for 
safety and soundness and consumer compliance matters  and be timelier in our 
feedback to banks .  We must fully leverage our distributed structure to delegate 
decision mak ing to our Reserve Banks, without diminishing the Board’s 
important policymaking and oversight role over the supervision of banks.  - 13 - 
 
 
 • And fifth, we must ensure that we are always able  to adjust our supervisory 
expectations effectively and efficiently as condi tions warrant to enable banks to 
be more flexible in serving their communities and in providing c redit to the areas 
of our economy that most need it.  
When I spoke at this conference in 2019, I discussed a number of very practical 
problems that we needed to solve .  These included understanding how technology, 
competition, regulation, and other factors drive industry consolidation, quantifying the 
benefits community banks provide to their communities, and defining the full economic 
effects a community bank ha s on its community.7  
As we move forward with modernizing our supervisory approach, these  questions  
remain at the forefront of our thinking .  But , based on our experiences of the past few 
years, we also have a number of new questions that we’ll need to address if we are to be successful.  
For example, what do banks see as the most transformative technological 
innovations  that will drive changes to t heir business model s?  How do banking 
institutions  prefer to interact with their supervisors , and what  do they think makes for a 
successful relationship between the supervisor and the supervised?    
The factors th at are identified through this initiative  as having the greatest 
potential influence on future bank business model s will vary based on several factors, 
including size, complexity, geography, staff capacity, and business strategy , but, taken

Community Banking Research and Policy Conference, St. Louis, MO, October 1, 2019),

 together, they will give us important insights into how we, as bank supervisors, might 
need to evolve our supervisory practices as the bank business model evolves.  
And a s we consider our own evolution in the face of these changes, we will need 
to ask ourselves:  
• What changes to the Federal Reserve System Supervision function’s workforce, processe s and technology are necessary to execute our supervisory activities given 
the factors affecting the industry?  
• How should the Federal Reserve structure its supervisory activities across its  
portfolios of supervised firms?  
• Where are we aligned across the Supervision function in conducting our work?  
Where might we be out of alignment?  
• Should innovations in technology, such as a rtificial i ntelligence,  be used to better 
accomplish supervision?  
In the future, I look forward to sharing our progress on this initiative  and providing 
specific examples of how our supervisory practices are evolving alongside those of the 
industry.   
Times of  crisis, such as the COVID- 19 pandemic, provide us a unique opportunity 
to see how our banking system operates under stress —and to see both the strengths of our 
current system of supervision a s well as opportunities for improvement.  
The lessons we learned over the past 18 months, supported by research from this 
conference and from other sources, offer important lessons on how we can appropriately 
evolve our supervisory approaches.   - 15 - 
 
 
 What we learn  over the next two days  from the researchers, policymakers, and 
community bankers presenting during this year’s conference proceedings will factor into 
our overall thinking as we embark on this journey to modernize our supervisory practices and develop new supervisory approaches  that can meet the needs of today, and the 
challenges of tomorrow.

Good morning.  It is a pleasure to welcome you to today’s discussion and to host 
this third C onference on D iversity and I nclusion in E conomics, Finance, and C entral 
Banking.  My colleagues and I are proud to cosponsor this conference along with the 
Bank of Canada , the Bank of England, and the European Central Bank.  
We are truly honored by this impressive array of panelists, discussants, and 
speakers, which include emin ent research economists as well as current and former 
policymakers from here and around the world.  We are grateful for the time, energy, and 
insights you have committed to this work, and we look forward to the day when we can 
gather together again in pers on. 
To kick off today’s discussions, I would like to touch briefly on these subjects 
from two distinct perspectives.  First, I will discuss some of the ways we at the Federal Reserve approach issues of persistent economic inequities.  Then I will review so me of 
how we as central banks are addressing the issues around diversity and inclusion in economics as institutions and employers.    
Policymaking  
Taking the first of these topics, we know, of course, that an economy is healthier 
and stronger when as many people as possible are able to work.  If entrenched inequities prevent some Americans from participating fully in our labor markets, not only will they be held back from opportunities, but our economy overall will not realize its potential.  And those who have historically been left behind stand the best chance of prospering in a strong economy with plentiful job opportunities.  
Our recent history highlights both the benefits of a strong economy and the severe 
costs of a weak one.  In the later years of the long expansion that ended with the  - 2 - 
pandemic, the benefits of employment continued to spread more widely and to reach 
those at the margins of the economy.  Prior to the pandemic, unemployment was at 50-year lows.  Wages had been moving up, and meaningfully so, especially on the lower 
ends of the pay scale.  Many who had struggled for years were finding jobs.  Racial disparities in unemployment were narrowing.  
In contrast, one of the great cruelties of the C OVID- 19 recession is the toll it took 
on workers who were finally beginning to experience the benefits of a period of historically long economic growth.  Those same groups, unfortunately, disproportionately shouldered the brunt of the pandemic’s burden.  
Most entrenched inequities are beyond the power of m onetary policy to address.  
The specific goals given to us by Congress, however, to foster achievement of our dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability, form the foundation of a strong and stable economy.  
It was with this in mind that my colleagues and I on the Federal Open Market 
Committee, as part of last year’s update to the Fed’s monetary policy framework, defined maximum employment as a broad and inclusive goal.  This innovation recognizes that a strong labor market delivers broad- reachin g benefits and extends those benefits in 
particular to low - and moderate -income communities.  While monetary policy does not 
target any particular group of people, when we assess whether we are at maximum employment, we purposely look at a wide range of indicators, and we are attentive to disparities in the labor market, rather than just the headline numbers.   
Diversity and inclusion play a role in policymaking as well.  As policymakers 
working on behalf of the entire public, we benefit greatly by seeking out and listening to  - 3 - 
the perspectives and experiences of people who represent the diverse landscape of the 
economy.  We regularly meet with a broad range of groups as we assess the economy.  And as we worked to update our monetary policy framework, we host ed a series of 
listening events across the country before and during the pandemic, and these conversations factored importantly into our thinking and our new framework.    
Diversity in Economics  
Next, I  woul d like to turn to an issue facing many of us at th is conference—
namely , how central banks as institutions and employers grapple with and confront 
diversity and inclusion within economics.  Collectively, we are among the largest employers in the field of economics, which both affects our own workplaces and affords 
us an opportunity to help influence and shape the evolution of the profession.   
Throughout my career, in both the public and the private sector s, I have seen that 
the best and most successful organizations are often the ones that have a strong and 
persistent commitment to diversity and inclusion.  These organizations consistently attract the best talent, by investing in and retaining a world -class workforce.   
I know that the central banks represented here today are indeed working diligently 
to do just that.  At the Fed, we are hosting events like this one, where high- quality 
economic research is brought to bear.  We are working to foster an inclusive workplace environment where staff can feel comfortable at work and to promote a similarly inclusiv e culture within the profession.  We are working to broaden our reach by 
recruiting at historically black colleges and universities and Hispanic -serving institutions, 
as well as by hosting events to promote career opportunities at the Fed.    - 4 - 
My colleagues and I know that both the opportunities and the challenges are great 
and that the work is never truly done.  Whether you are a researcher bringing your 
analytical skills to bear , or you are on the front  lines of improving the diversity of the 
economics pipeline , or perhaps you are in an institution where you are redoubling your 
efforts to attract diverse talent, your endeavors  are making a difference.  As a group, we 
are fortunate to have opportunities like this to reaffirm the importance of diver sity in our 
professions, in our research, and in our policymaking, and I am glad that we are here today to continue this work.  Thank you.  ",2021-11-09,powell

Community Banking in a Period of Recovery and Change 
     
Remarks by 
  
Ben S. Bernanke 
  
Chairman 
 
 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
  
at the 
  
Independent Community Bankers of America National Convention 
  
San Diego, California 
  
March 23, 2011 
 It’s a pleasure to have the opportunity to  speak once again before the Independent 
Community Bankers of America (ICBA).  This is the sixth consecutive year  that I’ve met with 
you at this event, and the themes of my rema rks over the years tell a story not only about the 
financial and economic upheaval that  we have all experienced, but also about some of the very 
difficult issues that continue to confront bot h bankers and policymakers today.  Back in 2006, 
less than two months after I started as Chairma n, I spoke to you about the strong performance of 
community banks as well as about some important  longer-term challenges.  In subsequent years, 
my remarks touched on the need to strengthen regulation and supervision of Fannie Mae and 
Freddie Mac, approaches to reducing preventa ble mortgage foreclos ures, community banking 
and the financial crisis, and then last year, the need to address th e problem of financial 
institutions that are “too big to fail.”  My themes today are the vital role that community banks 
need to play in the economic recovery, the valu e that the Federal Reserve places on insights from 
community banks, and the evol ving regulatory environment. 
Community Banks and the Economic Recovery 
To me, the title of the 2009 ICBA annual report, Empowering Main Street , is a concise 
and accurate description of the critical role th at community banks play in the U.S. economy.  
Community bankers live and work where they do bus iness, and their institu tions have deep roots, 
sometimes established over several generations .  They know their customers and the local 
economy.  Relationship banking is therefore at the core of community banking.  The largest 
banks typically rely heavily on statistical models  to assess borrowers’ capital, collateral, and 
capacity to repay, and those approaches can a dd value, but banks whose headquarters and key 
decisionmakers are hundreds or t housands of miles away inevita bly lack the in-depth local 
knowledge that community banks use to assess character and conditions  when making credit  
 - 2 -
decisions.  This advantage for community banks is  fundamental to their effectiveness and cannot 
be matched by models or algorithms, no matter ho w sophisticated.  The IBM computer program 
Watson may play a mean game of Jeopardy, but I would not trust it to j udge the creditworthiness 
of a fledgling local business or to build longsta nding personal relationships with customers and 
borrowers. 
Given the important role that community banks  play in their local economies, we at the 
Federal Reserve are keenly interested in their health and their collective future.  Local communities, ranging from small towns to urban neighborhoods, are the foundation of the U.S. 
economy and communities need community banks to he lp them grow and prosper.  As I’m sure 
you are all too aware, the financial crisis and its aftermath have hit some community banks 
especially hard, and those institutions will continue  to need time to repair their balance sheets.  
Although we are not yet where we would like to  be, the good news is that many community 
banks are recovering and reporti ng stronger performance.   
Indeed, despite some of the worst economi c conditions since the Great Depression and 
their own strained balance sheets,  community banks have already b een doing their part to meet 
the credit needs of their customer s, notably including small business customers.  We have been 
spending a lot of time at the Federal Reserve tr ying to understand and promote lending to small 
businesses, and one of the intere sting things we have found is that while small business lending 
contracted overall from mid-2008 through 2010, this  contraction was not uniform.  In fact, a 
majority of the smallest banks (in this case, th ose with assets of $250 m illion or less) actually 
increased their small business lending during this  period.  And while banks with assets between 
$250 million and $1 billion showed a slight declin e in small business lending over this period, 
the contraction was not nearly as sharp as it was for the largest banks.  This hard evidence  
 - 3 -
underscores the important benefits of relationshi p banking, particularly in periods of unusual 
economic and financial stress. 
Community Banks and the Federal Reserve 
You may recall that in my rema rks to this group last year, I noted that the decentralized 
structure of the Federal Reserve System, with 12 Reserve Banks and 24 branches located in cities 
across the country, was designed to ensure th at local insights and information would be 
incorporated in the deliberati ons of both the Board and the Federal Open Market Committee.  
During the debates leading up to the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and 
Consumer Protection Act, we emphasized that ou r supervisory responsibility for state-chartered 
banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System and bank holding companies of all sizes 
not only provides valuable economic information at the grass-roots leve l that would be very 
difficult to replace, it also gives us  a fuller picture of the nation’s financial system.  At the same 
time, the range of expertise that the Federal Rese rve develops in making monetary policy and in 
its engagement with the financial system allows us to bring unique insights and value-added to 
our supervisory activities.  Fort unately, the Congress decided to preserve the Federal Reserve’s 
existing supervisory authority over smaller as well as larger banking or ganizations.  It also 
broadened the Federal Reserve’s connections to Ma in Street by adding hundr eds of thrift holding 
companies to the institutions we supervise.  We  are delighted that, through our supervision, our 
gathering of economic intelligence, and the ac tivities of our community affairs departments 
around the country, we will be able to remain fully engaged with grass-roots America.   
 The Federal Reserve has undertaken several rece nt initiatives to enha nce our interactions 
with community banks and ensure that we fully ta ke their perspectives and unique characteristics 
into account in our policymaking.  First, for many years, the Board has had a committee of  
 - 4 -
Governors that provides oversight on bank s upervisory and regulatory matters.  Although many 
of this committee’s efforts in the wake of the financial crisis have understandably been focused 
on the largest and most complex banking organizations , the Board believes that it is important to 
sharpen our focus on smaller banking organizations as  well.  As a result, we recently established 
a special supervision subcommittee that focu ses on community banks and smaller regional 
institutions.  This subcommittee is chaired by a former longtime commun ity banker, Governor 
Betsy Duke, and also includes a former state banking commissioner, Governor Sarah Bloom 
Raskin.   
The subcommittee provides leadership and ove rsight on a variety of matters related 
specifically to our supervision of community and smaller regional banks.1  In particular, the 
subcommittee is reviewing new policy proposals th rough the lens of the effect those proposals 
could have on smaller institutions, both in term s of safety and soundness and potential regulatory 
burden.  Among other things, the subcommittee al so monitors the Federal Reserve’s working 
relationship with state banking supervisors, whic h is particularly important because we share 
with them supervisory responsibility for state member banks.   
We have also undertaken an initiative to solicit feedback from community banks on a 
more regular basis.  In Oc tober, the Board announced that it would form a Community 
Depository Institutions Advisory Council to pr ovide insight and information on the economy, 
lending conditions, and other issues of interest to community banks.2  To make this council as 
representative as possible, each of the 12 Reserv e Banks now has its own local advisory council 
comprising representatives from banks, thrift in stitutions, and credit unions; one member from 
                                                 
1 For supervisory purposes, the Federal Reserve generally considers banking organizations with assets of $10 billion 
or less to be community banking organizations and those with assets between $10 billion and $50 billion to be 
regional banking organizations. 
2 This group replaces the former Thri ft Institution Advisory Co uncil, which provided the Board with useful 
information from the perspective of thrift institutions and credit unions.  
 - 5 -
each local council serves on the national council th at will meet with the Board twice a year in 
Washington.  Local meetings have already be gun, and the first meeting of the national council 
with the Board will take place soon.  Personally, I am looking forward to hearing more from 
community bankers about issues ranging from their local economies to regulatory reform.  
Community Banks and Regulatory Reform 
As you know, a key challenge for community banks  in the years ahead will be to adapt to 
the changing regulatory environment, particularly  the regulatory reforms contained in the Dodd-
Frank Act, as well as the changes that will be as sociated with the Basel III reforms.  We are 
certainly aware of and appreciate the concerns that community ba nks have about these regulatory 
changes, and, as I have just described, we have stepped up our efforts to understand those 
concerns and to respond to them as appropriate.  I think it is wo rth emphasizing that the changes 
we will be seeing in the financial regulatory arch itecture are principally directed at our largest 
and most complex financial firms, including nonba nks.  Consequently, one benefit of the reforms 
should be the creation of a more level playing fi eld for financial institutions of all sizes. 
Focusing reform on our largest, most complex financial firms makes sense.  The recent 
financial crisis highlighted the f act that some financial firms ha d grown so large, leveraged, and 
interconnected that their failure could pose a thre at to overall financial stability.  The sudden 
collapses of major financial firms were among the most destabilizing events  of the crisis.  The 
crisis also demonstrated the inadequacy of the existing frame work for supervising, regulating, 
and otherwise constraining the risks of major fi nancial firms as well as of the toolkit the 
government had at the time to manage their failure. 
As I discussed with you at last  year’s meeting, a major thru st of the Dodd-Frank Act is 
addressing the too-big-to-fail problem and mitiga ting the threat to financial stability posed by  
 - 6 -
systemically important financial firms.  The too-bi g-to-fail problem is a pe rnicious one that has a 
number of substantial harmful effects.  Criti cally, it reduces the incen tives of shareholders, 
creditors, and counterparties of such firms to discipline excessi ve risk-taking.  And it produces 
competitive distortions by enabling firms with larg e systemic footprints to fund themselves more 
cheaply than other firms because of the implic it subsidy of too-big-to-fail status.  This 
competitive distortion is not only unfair to sma ller firms and damaging to competition today, but 
it also spurs further growth by the largest firms and more consolidation and concentration in the 
financial industry.  A financia l system dominated by too-big-to -fail firms cannot be a healthy 
financial system. 
The act addresses the too-big-to-fail problem  with a multi-pronged approach.  Under it, 
we are developing more-stringent prudential standa rds for banking firms with assets greater than 
$50 billion and all nonbank financial firms designate d as systemically important by the Financial 
Stability Oversight Council.  These more-stri ngent standards will incl ude stronger capital and 
leverage requirements, liquidity requirements, and single-counterparty credit limits, as well as 
requirements to periodically produce resolution plan s and conduct stress test s.  Our goal is to 
produce a well-integrated set of ru les that meaningfully reduces th e probability of failure of our 
largest, most complex financial firms and that minimizes the losses to the financial system and the economy if such a firm should fail.  In doing so, we aim to force these firms to take into account the costs that they impos e on the broader financial system, soak up the implicit subsidy 
these firms enjoy due to market perceptions of their systemic importance, and give the firms 
regulatory incentives to shrink th eir systemic footprint.   
Complementing these efforts, the Federal Rese rve has been working for some time with 
other regulatory agencies and cen tral banks around the world to design and implement a stronger  
 - 7 -
set of prudential requirements for large, inte rnationally active banking firms.  These efforts 
include the agreements reached in December on the major elements of the new Basel III 
prudential framework for large, globally active banks.  Basel III should make the financial system more stable and reduce the likelihood of future financial crises by requiring large banks 
to hold more and better-quality capital and more-robust liquidity buffers.  A more stable 
financial system will benefit all banking institutions and, of course, our economy as a whole.  
We are working to adopt the Basel III framew ork in the United States in a timely manner. 
A central issue that we and the other banking agencies face in implementing Basel III in 
the United States is deciding how these capital ru les will be applied fo r banks that are not 
systemic or internationally active.  We recogn ize the importance of striking the right balance 
between promoting safety and soundness through out the banking system and keeping the 
compliance costs for smaller banking firms as low as possible.  Also, to minimize the impact of 
the new capital rules on credit availability while  the global economy is st ill recovering, we and 
our international colleagues have agreed to a llow long transition periods for the implementation 
of the new standards. 
In addition to stricter regulation and supervis ion of large financial firms, the Dodd-Frank 
Act places new checks on the growth by acquisition of our major financial firms.  It expands 
current restraints on acquisiti ons by bank holding companies to  include a broader range of 
acquired firms (not just banks) and a broader range of liabilitie s (not just deposits).  This 
expansion reflects a financial system that has changed in important ways since 1994, when the 
Congress first adopted concentration limits  for banks and bank holding companies.  
The act also imposes new restrictions on the capital markets activities of banking firms--
restrictions that will di sproportionately affect the structure an d profitability of the largest banking  
 - 8 -
firms.  For example, the so-called Volcker rule wi ll restrict the ability of banking firms to engage 
in proprietary trading of securiti es and derivatives and to invest in or sponsor private investment 
funds.    
Among the most important aspects of act are the measures that it authorizes to reduce the 
financial and economic effects of the failure of la rge firms.  A clear lesson of the past few years 
is that the government must not be forced to choose between bailing out a systemically important 
firm and having it fail in a diso rderly and disruptive manner.  Instead, we need the tools to 
resolve a failing firm in a manner that preserves market discipline--by ensuring that shareholders 
and creditors incur losses and that culpable ma nagers are replaced--and that at the same time 
cushions the broader financial system from th e possibly destabilizing effects of the firm’s 
collapse.  Of course, such a framework has been in place for banks for several decades now, as you know.  The Dodd-Frank Act creates an anal ogous framework for systemically important 
nonbank financial firms, including bank holding co mpanies.  Resolving a large, multinational 
financial firm safely will likely always be a difficult challenge, and a great deal of work remains 
to be done to make these new authorities fully e ffective.  Ultimately, though, these changes will 
mitigate moral hazard in our financial system by reducing expectations of government support 
by the creditors and counterparties of large firms.   Taken together, the measures I have described 
should give us a financial system that is sa fer, more efficient, and more equitable. 
In short, two key objectives of financial regulatory reform  are, first, addressing the 
problems that emerged in the largest, most comp lex financial firms during the crisis and, second, 
creating a better balance with respect to regu lation and oversight between banks and nonbank 
financial firms.  The Federal Reserve believes th at these are the right goals for reform.  We are 
committed to working with the other U.S. financia l regulatory agencies to implement the act and  
 - 9 -
related reforms in a manner that both achieves the law’s key objectives and appropriately takes 
into account the risk profiles and business models of smaller banking firms, including 
community banks. 
Before I conclude my remarks, let me say a few words about the tran sfer of thrift holding 
company supervisory authority to the Federal Reserve.  We have been working closely with the 
Office of Thrift Supervision, the Office of th e Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation to make this transf er as smooth as possible, and progress so far 
has been good.  The Federal Reserve believes th at any company that controls a depository 
institution should be held to appropriate prude ntial standards, including those for capital, 
liquidity, and risk management.  As such, we in tend to create an oversight regime for thrift 
holding companies that is consistent  with, and is as rigorous as, the supervisory regime we apply 
to bank holding companies.  That said, we appr eciate that thrift and bank holding companies 
differ in important ways, play different role s in our economy, and will remain governed by 
different statutes.  We will be mindful of these differences and of the unique characteristics of 
the thrift industry as we de velop our supervisory approach to thrift holding companies. 
Conclusion 
My colleague, Governor Duke, recently told our examiners that “community bankers are 
creative, committed, stubborn, and resilient.”  I know she won’t mind my repeating that 
sentiment here, and I’m sure most of the comm unity bankers in this room would wear those 
words as a badge of honor.  Community banks face substantial challenges in the months and years to come, including still-difficult economic c onditions, continued uncertainties in real estate 
and other key markets, and a changing regulat ory environment.  But community banks have 
faced difficult times before, and the industry has re mained vibrant and resili ent.  I am confident  
 - 10 -
that community banking will successfully navigate these new challenges as well.  Thank you for 
what you do every day to meet the needs of your communities and to help our economy grow 
stronger.  ",2011-03-22,bernanke

Implementing a Macroprudential Appro ach to Supervision and Regulation 
   
Remarks by 
 
Ben S. Bernanke  
 
Chairman 
 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
 
at the 
 
Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago 
 
47th Annual Conference on Bank Structure and Competition 
 
Chicago, Illinois 
       
May 5, 2011 
  
 The recent financial crisis revealed criti cal gaps and weaknesses in the U.S. 
financial system and the financial regu latory framework.  The Congress and the 
Administration last year provi ded a roadmap for addressing many of these problems, in 
the form of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-
Frank Act)--the topic of this year’s conference. 
Legislative reforms in any complex area al ways face the risk of fighting the last 
war, responding to the causes of the last crisis without su fficient attention to where new 
problems may arise.  To thei r credit, the authors of the Dodd-Frank Act attempted to 
reduce this risk by building in  a number of features aimed at helping our system of 
financial oversight adap t over time to changes in the fina ncial environment.  Notably, a 
central element of the legisla tion is the requirement that the Federal Reserve and other 
financial regulatory agencies adopt a so- called macroprudential a pproach--that is, an 
approach that supplements traditional superv ision and regulation of individual firms or 
markets with explicit consideration of threats to  the stability of the financial system as a 
whole.  The act also created a new Fina ncial Stability Over sight Council, whose 
membership comprises a diverse group of fe deral and state financial regulators, to 
coordinate the government’s efforts to identify and respond to systemic risks. 
The explicit incorporation of macroprudential considerations in the nation’s 
framework for financial oversight represen ts a major innovation in our thinking about 
financial regulation, one that is taking hold abroad as well as in the United States.  This 
new direction is constructive and necessary, I believe, but it also poses considerable 
conceptual and operational challenges in its implementation.  In my remarks today I will 
briefly discuss the rationale for macroprudent ial supervision and regulation, describe the  - 2 -
new structure of macroprudential supervisi on and regulation in th e United States, and 
explain how we at the Fed are doing our part  to implement the macroprudential approach 
to financial oversight.  
Macroprudential Supervision and Regulation 
Ultimately, the goal of macroprudential s upervision and regulation is to minimize 
the risk of financial disrupti ons that are sufficiently severe to inflict significant damage 
on the broader economy.  The systemic orient ation of the macroprudential approach may 
be contrasted with that of the traditional, or “microprudential,” approach to regulation and supervision, which is concerned prim arily with the safety and soundness of 
individual institutions, markets, or infrastructures. 
Relative to traditional regulation and supervision, executing a macroprudential 
approach to oversight can involve heavier in formational requirements and more-complex 
analytic frameworks.  In particular, because  of the highly interconnected nature of our 
financial system, macroprudent ial oversight must be concer ned with all major segments 
of the financial sector, includi ng financial institutions, market s, and infrastructures; it 
must also place particular emphasis on understanding the complex linkages and interdependencies among institutions and markets, as these linkages determine how 
instability may be propagate d throughout the system.  Moreover, broadly speaking, 
macroprudential regulators must be concerned w ith at least two types of risks.  The first 
type encompasses aspects of the structure of the financial system--such as gaps in 
regulatory coverage or the evolution of  shadow banking--that pose ongoing risks to 
financial stability.  The second class of risks are those that vary over time with financial  - 3 -
or economic circumstances, such as widespr ead buildups of leverage in good times that 
could ultimately unwind in  destabilizing ways.  
To be sure, a macroprudential approach to  oversight does not avoid the need for 
careful microprudential regulation and supe rvision.  The oversight of individual 
institutions serves many purposes beyond th e enhancement of systemic stability, 
including the protection of the deposit insurance fund, the detection of money laundering 
and other forms of financial crime, and th e prevention of unlawful discrimination or 
abusive lending practices .  Equally important, however, is  that microprudential oversight 
also provides the knowledge base on which a mo re systemic approach must be built; we 
cannot understand what is going on in the syst em as a whole without  a clear view of 
developments within key firms and mark ets.  Without a st rong microprudential 
framework to underpin them, macroprudent ial policies would be ineffective. 
That said, a key lesson of the crisis is  that a purely micr oprudential approach, 
focused on the conditions of individual firms or markets, may fail to detect important 
systemic or cross-cutting risks.  For exam ple, a traditional microprudential examination 
might find that an individual financial inst itution is relying heavily on short-term 
wholesale funding, which may or may not induce a supervisory response.  The 
implications of that finding fo r the stability of the broader system, however, cannot be 
determined without knowing what is happening out side that particular  firm.  Are other, 
similar financial firms also highly reliant on sh ort-term funding?  If so, are the sources of 
short-term funding heavily conc entrated?  Is the market fo r short-term funding likely to 
be stable in a period of high uncertainty, or is it vulnerable to runs?  If short-term funding 
were suddenly to become unavailable, how would the borrowing firms react--for  - 4 -
example, would they be forced into a fi re sale of assets, which itself could be 
destabilizing, or would they cease to provide  funding or critical services for other 
financial actors?  Finally, what implicatio ns would these developments have for the 
broader economy?  The analysis of risks from a systemic perspective, not just from the 
perspective of an individual firm, is th e hallmark of macroprudential regulation and 
supervision.  And the remedies that might em erge from such an analysis could well be 
more far-reaching and more structural in na ture than simply requiring a few firms to 
modify their funding patterns.  
Implementing the Macroprudential Approach in the United States 
Let me be more concrete and talk  about the implementation of the 
macroprudential approach in the context of the evolvi ng U.S. regulatory system. 
The first required element of macroprudential oversight is a system for 
monitoring evolving risks to financial stab ility.  Beyond assigning individual regulatory 
agencies this responsibility, the Dodd-Frank Act took the additional step of setting up a 
new body, the Financial Stability Oversight Counc il, as I mentioned earlier.  The council 
is charged with monitoring the U.S. financia l system, identifying risks that threaten the 
stability of that system, and promoting mark et discipline and other conditions that 
mitigate excessive risk-taking in financial ma rkets.  The council is made up of 10 voting 
members--including the Federal Reserve--a nd 5 nonvoting members, who serve in an 
advisory capacity.1    
                                                 
1 The Secretary of the Treasury serves as the chairman  of the Financial Stability Oversight Council. Other 
voting members include the heads of the Office of th e Comptroller of the Currency, the Securities and 
Exchange Commission, the Federal Deposit Insuran ce Corporation, the Commodity Futures Trading 
Commission, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the National Credit Union Administration, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, and an independent insurance expert appointed by the President. The 
latter two seats are not yet filled.  - 5 -
The regulatory agencies represented on the council oversee a wide range of 
participants in the U.S. financial system .  The broad membership of the council is 
intended to limit the tendency of regulato rs to focus narrowly on the institutions and 
markets within their jurisdictions while overl ooking risks from interd ependencies that cut 
across jurisdictions.  The counc il also facilitates coordina tion and information sharing 
among member agencies.  By breaking down the silos that in the past sometimes 
discouraged agencies from looking beyond th eir specific responsib ilities, the council 
should help identify and eliminate gaps and w eaknesses within the regu latory structure.   
The Dodd-Frank Act also established --within the Treasury Department--the 
Office of Financial Research, which is respon sible for improving the quality of financial 
data available to policymakers.  The oversig ht council may direct the research office to 
collect information from certain individual financial companies to assess risks to the 
financial system.  This collection and analys is of financial-sector data should allow 
regulators to see more of the financial la ndscape and better equip them to identify 
systemic risks and other emerging threats.   
To digress for a moment, it’s interesting that the United States isn’t the only 
jurisdiction that has recen tly created a new institutiona l structure to implement 
macroprudential policies.  Notably, the Europe an Union (EU) established the European 
Systemic Risk Board, which is responsible fo r the macroprudential ove rsight of the EU’s 
financial system.  The board will collect and analyze information on the EU’s financial 
system, identify and prioritize systemic risk s, and issue warnings and recommendations 
to national and European author ities.  It will also work closely with the three newly 
created European Supervisory Authorities, which in turn ar e charged with coordinating  - 6 -
prudential regulations for banking, insurance,  and securities among EU member states.2  
In the United Kingdom, the government plan s to move its micropr udential regulatory 
authority back into the Bank of England and create a new Financial Policy Committee to 
implement macroprudential policies.  (Forme r Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman 
Donald Kohn has been tapped to serve on th e Financial Policy Committee, which must 
make him one of the few people to have se rved as a top financ ial regulator in two 
different countries.)  The U.K. committee is expected to identify and monitor systemic 
risks and take actions to remove or redu ce them.  And it will operate a new resolution 
regime for failing financial firms.   The monitoring efforts of the Financial Stability Oversight Council in the United 
States are already well unde r way.  Staff members from the member agencies have 
established working groups w ith responsibility for specific sectors or aspects of the 
financial system and are making regular presenta tions to the council.  This work will also 
be reflected in the council’s required annual report to the Congress on financial stability, 
which is expected to be released in the summer.  Of course, the identification of threats to  financial stability must be followed by 
appropriate remedies.  The powers of the c ouncil itself are relatively limited in this 
regard, at least under most circumstances.  Pe rhaps its most important responsibility is 
the designation of certain nonbank financial fi rms and financial market utilities as 
systemically important and thereby subject to additional regulation and oversight by the Federal Reserve and other member agencies, including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Excha nge Commission (SEC).  To make those 
                                                
 
2 The three authorities are the European Securities and Markets Authority, the European Banking 
Authority, and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority.   - 7 -
designations, the council will need to determine criteria for identifying firms whose 
financial distress would impose th e greatest risks to financial stability.  Of course, this 
task requires continued development of an analytical framework for understanding 
systemic risk and its sources. 
Although the council’s own powers are ci rcumscribed to some degree, the 
potential benefits of its ability to foster cooperative work among U.S. regulatory agencies 
should not be underestimated.  To cite just one example, the stability of money market 
mutual funds--which suffered dramatic runs  that worsened funding conditions at the 
height of the crisis--is clearly a systemic i ssue, not just an industry issue.  The SEC, 
which has already issued rules to increase the stability of mo ney market mutual funds, is 
appropriately taking the lead in  investigating whether furthe r steps are necessary.  Under 
the aegis of the council, howev er, the SEC has consulted with  other agenci es, including 
the Federal Reserve, which have provided their own analyses and perspectives.  In 
particular, interagency consultation has helped clarify the potential systemic implications 
of instability in the money market mutual fund industry.  The Federal Reserve will be 
among the agencies participating in a roundt able on money fund re gulation sponsored by 
the SEC later this month . 
Understandably, given the damage wrought  by the crisis, th e council and its 
members remain focused on addressing possible sources of financial instability, including 
both structural problems and risks aris ing from ongoing economic or financial 
developments.  However, no one’s interests ar e served by the imposition of ineffective or 
burdensome rules that lead to excessive increases in costs or  unnecessary restrictions in 
the supply of credit.  Increased coordina tion and cooperation among regulators, under the  - 8 -
auspices of the council where appropriate , should serve not only to improve our 
management of systemic risk, but also reduce the extent of duplica tive, inconsistent, or 
ineffective rulemakings.  More generally, in evaluating alterna tive approaches to 
mitigating systemic risks, regulators must aim to avoid stifling reasonable risk-taking and innovation in financial markets, as these fact ors play an important role in fostering 
broader productivity gains, ec onomic growth, and job creation.  
Macroprudential Policy at the Federal Reserve 
As I have mentioned, besides creating new institutions like the Financial Stability 
Oversight Council, the Dodd-Frank Act has also imposed a macroprudential mandate on 
individual agencies, including the Federal Reserv e.  This mandate comes, in some cases, 
with changes in the powers and responsibilitie s of key agencies.  In the case of the 
Federal Reserve, in addition to membership on the Financial Stability Oversight Council, 
our new responsibilities include the supervis ion of thrift holding companies as well as 
oversight of nonbank financial firms and cer tain payment, clearing, and settlement 
utilities that the counc il designates as systemically importa nt.  In consultation with other 
agencies, we also are responsible for devel oping more-stringent pr udential standards for 
all large banking organiza tions and for nonbank firms designated by the council as 
systemically important.  These enhanced standards include tougher capital and liquidity requirements, the development of resolution plans (so-called living wills), mandatory 
stress tests conducted by the Federal Re serve and by the firms themselves, new 
counterparty credit limits, and more-dem anding risk-management requirements.  
The Federal Reserve has made and wi ll continue to make significant 
organizational changes as needed to best fu lfill our responsibilities.  Even before the  - 9 -
enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, we had begun to overhaul our supervision of the 
largest, most-complex financial firms.  An important milestone in this regard was the 
Federal Reserve’s leadership in the spring of  2009 of the Supervisory Capital Assessment 
Program, popularly known as the bank stress test, which comprehensively evaluated the 
health of the largest banking organizations in  the country.  We lear ned valuable lessons 
from that exercise, including an appreciation of  the additional insights  that can be gained 
by examining a number of major institutions simultaneously, with a focus on comparative 
performance.  Another lesson of the stress test was the value of a multidisciplinary approach to supervision, one that combines the skills of economists, financial experts, 
payments systems analysts, and other specialists with those of supervisors and examiners.   
Drawing on this experience, we created a high-level, multidisciplinary working 
group within the Federal Reserve to overs ee the supervision of  large financial 
institutions.  Under the auspices of th is committee--called the Large Institution 
Supervision Coordinating Comm ittee, or LISCC--Federal Rese rve supervisors, supported 
by economists and other experts, now routinely use horizontal, or cross-firm, reviews to 
monitor industry practices, common investme nt or funding strategi es, changes in the 
degree or form of financial in terconnectedness, or other deve lopments with implications 
for systemic risk.  Supplementing its indivi dual and horizontal re views, the LISCC has 
also made increasing use of improved quantit ative methods for eval uating the health and 
performance of supervised firms as well as  the risks they may pose to the broader 
financial system.  A similar committee structure within the Federal Reserve is being developed to help us meet our obligations to  supervise systemically  important financial 
market utilities.    - 10 -
To improve our monitoring of the financ ial system and to coordinate work 
bearing on financial stability, we have also created a new office within the Board, called 
the Office of Financial Stability Policy and Re search.  This office br ings together staff 
with a range of backgrounds and skills and wo rks closely with other groups at the Federal 
Reserve.  The office helps monitor global fina ncial risks and analyze the implications of 
those risks for financial stability; work s with our bank supervisory committees, for 
example, on the development of quantitative loss models and alternative scenarios to 
serve as the basis for stress tests; serves as a liaison to the Financial Stability Oversight 
Council and its various working groups; and helps develop and ev aluate alternative 
approaches to implementing macroprudential regulations.   
The recent Comprehensive Capital Analys is and Review, in which the Federal 
Reserve evaluated the internal capital plan ning processes and shar eholder distribution 
requests of the 19 largest bank holding companies, is an example of a horizontal 
assessment with a macroprudential approach.  In the wake of the crisis, banks’ capital 
payouts had been kept to a mi nimum.  As banks’ earnings an d capital positions continued 
to improve in 2010, however, some firms sought approval to increase di vidends or restart 
share repurchase programs.  The simultaneous  assessment of the payout requests in the 
capital review allowed the Federal Reserve, working through the LISCC, to evaluate not 
only the conditions of individual banks but al so the potential implications of capital 
payouts for aggregate credit exte nsion and the sustainability of the economic recovery.  
Thus, the program had both micropruden tial and macroprudential goals.  From a 
traditional safety-and-soundness perspective, we wa nted each firm to demonstrate that it 
had robust risk-management systems as well as  a capital plan that  would allow it to  - 11 -
manage potential losses in stress scenario s while comfortably meeting Basel III capital 
requirements as they are phased in.  But, w ith the help of macroeconomic and capital 
market analysts, we also considered the im plications of the requests for the capital 
available to the banking system as a whole, w ith the objective of ensuring that bank credit 
would still be available to households a nd businesses even if the economy were to 
perform more poorly than expected. 
We now also routinely apply macroprude ntial methods to the analysis of 
significant economic developments, whether do mestic or foreign.  The sovereign debt 
concerns in Europe provide one example.  As yields on European sovereign debt and 
bank debt rose in the spring of 2010, Federal Re serve supervisors began to evaluate U.S. 
banking firms’ exposures to European banki ng firms and sovereigns.  In addition to 
evaluating direct exposures, we analyzed s cenarios under which sovereign debt concerns 
might lead to broader financial volatility.  Our focus was on the possibility that financial 
disruptions might impede credit flows and economic activity in both Europe and the 
United States.  In our work we conferred exte nsively with European bank supervisors; for 
example, we discussed potential risks to European banks’ abilities to obtain dollar 
funding and the implications of European banks ’ need for dollars on U.S. money markets.  
This work suggested that providing a back stop for the dollar-funding needs of European 
financial institutions could mitigate the potenti al for spillovers to the United States from 
European sovereign debt concerns.  In accord with this analysis, in May 2010 the Federal Open Market Committee announced that it had au thorized dollar liquidity swap lines with 
other central banks in a preemptive move to avert a further deteri oration in liquidity 
conditions.  - 12 -
Macroprudential considerati ons have also been important for the Federal 
Reserve’s rulemaking, particularly those ru les implementing the Dodd-Frank Act.  For 
example, with other regulators , we recently proposed rules to set margin requirements for 
over-the-counter derivatives that are not cleared through a central counterparty.  The 
proposed rules reflect not only safety-and-s oundness concerns but also macroprudential 
goals; specifically, the rules seek to increase th e resiliency of the financial system as a 
whole by reducing the potential for contagion between swap market participants.  Under 
the proposed rules, the most-stringent marg in requirements would apply to derivatives 
contracts between swap dealers or other ma jor swaps market participants, as such 
arrangements could otherwise i nvolve a risk of “default chains” in which distress at one 
major firm could cascade through the swap markets.   
As I mentioned earlier, the macroprudentia l approach to financial regulation is 
gaining increasing adherence internationally.  Along with our efforts to implement 
reforms domestically, the Federal Reserve ha s for some time been working closely with 
foreign counterparts to help c oordinate the reform process at the international level.  The 
objectives of international coordination are of the highest importance.  These goals 
include maintaining a level competitive playing field across countries, minimizing 
opportunities for multinational fi rms to take advantage of weaker or inconsistent 
regulations in some jurisdictions, establishi ng consistent and complementary standards, 
and ensuring effective oversight of interna tionally active firms and markets.  The Group 
of Twenty has devoted consider able attention to financial-sector policies in its meetings 
during the past couple of years.  The Fi nancial Stability Board, the Basel Committee on  - 13 -
Banking Supervision, and other international groups also ha ve undertaken substantial 
work to coordinate macroprude ntial policies ac ross borders.  
Much of the Federal Reserve’s internati onal effort has involved working with 
other regulatory agencies a nd central banks to design and implement new prudential 
requirements for internationally active banks.  This work resulted in the adoption of 
more-stringent regulatory cap ital standards for trading activities and securitization 
exposures in the summer of 2009, as well as th e agreement last fall on the major elements 
of the new Basel III framework for globa lly active banks.  Consistent with the 
macroprudential approach, the Basel III fram ework requires the largest, most globally 
active banks to hold more, higher-quality capit al, reflecting the greater systemic risk 
associated with financial distress at the largest institutions.  
Conclusion 
The financial crisis demonstrated clearly that supervisory and regulatory practices 
must consider overall financial stability as well as the safety and soundness of individual 
firms.  The Dodd-Frank Act requires regulat ors to mitigate the buildup of financial 
excesses and reduce vulnerabil ities, and it created an interagency council to monitor 
financial markets, to identify emerging threats,  and to help formulate policies to contain 
those risks.  For our part, the Federal Reserve has restructured  its internal operations to 
facilitate a macroprudential approach to supervision a nd regulation and to monitor 
systemic risks.  We are committed to work ing closely with the oversight council and 
other agencies to promote financial stabilit y.  While a great deal has been accomplished 
since the act was passed less th an a year ago, much work remains to better understand 
sources of systemic risk, to develop impr oved monitoring tools, and to evaluate and  - 14 -
implement policy instruments to reduce m acroprudential risks.  These are difficult 
challenges, but if we are to avoid a repeat of the crisis and its economic consequences, 
these challenges must be met.     ",2011-05-05,bernanke

Promoting Research and Development:  The Government’s Role 
 
Remarks by 
Ben S. Bernanke 
Chairman 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
at the conference 
“New Building Blocks for Jobs and Economic Growth” 
Georgetown University 
May 16, 2011 
 
  
 
 I am pleased to speak at this conference on new building blocks for jobs and 
economic growth.  The conference organizers  have gathered an outstanding group of 
participants and have set an ambitious agenda.  The topics you will address today and tomorrow, bearing on innovation and intangible capital, are central to understanding how 
we can best promote robust econom ic growth in the long run. 
I won’t have to spend much time convinci ng this audience of the importance of 
long-run economic growth.  The Nobel Prize- winning economist Robert E. Lucas, Jr., 
wrote that once one starts thinking about l ong-run growth and economic development, “it 
is hard to think about anything else.”
1  Although I don’t think I w ould go quite that far, it 
is certainly true that relatively small differe nces in rates of economic growth, maintained 
over a sustained period, can have enormous impli cations for material living standards.   A 
growth rate of output per person of 2-1/ 2 percent per year doubles average living 
standards in 28 years--about one generation--whereas output per person growing at what 
seems a modestly slower rate of 1-1/2 percen t a year leads to a doub ling in average living 
standards in about 47 years--r oughly two generations.  Compo und interest is powerful!  
Of course, factors other than aggregate economic growth cont ribute to changes in living 
standards for different segments of the populatio n, including shifts in relative wages and 
in rates of labor market part icipation.  Nonetheless, if out put per person increases more 
rapidly, the prospects for greater and more broad-based prosperity  are significantly 
enhanced. 
Over long spans of time, economic growth and the associated improvements in 
living standards reflect a number of determinan ts, including increases in workers’ skills, 
rates of saving and capital accumulation, and institutional factors ranging from the

 flexibility of markets to the quality of th e legal and regulatory frameworks.  However, 
innovation and technological cha nge are undoubtedly central to the growth process; over 
the past 200 years or so, innova tion, technical advances, and i nvestment in capital goods 
embodying new technologies have transforme d economies around the world.  In recent 
decades, as this audience well knows, a dvances in semiconductor technology have 
radically changed many aspects of our lives , from communication to health care.  
Technological developments further in the past , such as electrification or the internal 
combustion engine, were equally revolutiona ry, if not more so.  In addition, recent 
research has highlighted the important role played by intangible capital, such as the 
knowledge embodied in the workforce, business plans and practices, and brand names.  This research suggests that technological progress and the accumulation of intangible 
capital have together accounted for well over ha lf of the increase in output per hour in the 
United States during the past several decades.
2   
Innovation has not only led to new pr oducts and more-efficient production 
methods, but it has also induced dramatic ch anges in how businesses are organized and 
managed, highlighting the connections be tween new ideas and methods and the 
organizational structure needed to implement them.  For example, in the 19th century, the 
development of the railroad a nd telegraph, along with a host of other technologies, were 
associated with the rise of large businesses with national reach.  And, as transportation 
and communication technologies developed further in the 20th century, multinational 
corporations became more feas ible and prevalent.    
Economic policy affects innovation and long -run economic growth in many ways.  
A stable macroeconomic environment; s ound public finances; and well-functioning

 financial, labor, and product markets a ll support innovation, en trepreneurship, and 
growth, as do effective tax, trade, and regulat ory policies.  Policies directed at objectives 
such as the protection of intellectual propert y rights and the promotion of research and 
development, or R&D, promote innovation and technological change more directly. 
In the remainder of my remarks, I w ill focus on one important component of 
innovation policy--namely, government support fo r R&D.  As I have already suggested, 
the effective commercial application of new ideas involves much more than just pure 
research.  Many other factors are relevant, including the extent of market competition, the intellectual property regime, and the availability  of financing for innovative enterprises.  
That said, the tendency of the market to supply too little of ce rtain types of R&D 
provides a rationale for government inte rvention; and no matter how good the policy 
environment, ultimately, big new ideas are often rooted in well-executed R&D.   
The Rationale for a Government Ro le in Research and Development 
Governments in many countries directly s upport scientific and technical research, 
for example, through grant-providing agencies  (like the National Science Foundation in 
the United States) or through tax incentives (l ike the R&D tax credit).  In addition, the 
governments of the United States and many other countries run their own research 
facilities, including facilities focused on nonm ilitary applications such as health.  The 
primary economic rationale for a government role in R&D is that, absent such intervention, the private market  would not adequately supply  certain types of research.
3  
The argument, which applies particularly str ongly to basic or funda mental research, is 
that the full economic value of a scientific advance is unlikel y to accrue to its discoverer, 
                                                 
3 For an early version of this  argument see Arrow (1962).  - 4 - 
 
 
 especially if the new knowledge can be repl icated or disseminated at low cost.  For 
example, James Watson and Francis Crick received a minute fraction of the economic 
benefits that have flowed from  their discovery of the struct ure of DNA.  If many people 
are able to exploit, or otherwise benefit fr om, research done by othe rs, then the total or 
social return to research may be higher on average than the private return to those who 
bear the costs and risks of innovation.  As  a result, market forces will lead to 
underinvestment in R&D from society’s perspective, providing a rationale for 
government intervention. 
One possible policy response to the market underprovision problem would be to 
substantially strengthen the intellectual prope rty rights regime, for example, by granting 
the developers of new ideas strong and long-la sting claims to the economic benefits of 
their discoveries--perha ps by extending and expanding patent  rights.  This approach has 
significant drawbacks of its own, however, in th at strict limitations on the free use of new 
ideas would inhibit both further research a nd the development of valuable commercial 
applications.  Thus, although patent protecti ons and similar rules remain an important 
part of innovation policy, governments have also turned to di rect support of R&D 
activities. 
Of course, the rationale for government support of R&D would be weakened if 
governments had consistently performed poorly in  this sphere.  Certainly, there have been 
disappointments; for example, the surge in  federal investment in energy technology 
research in the 1970s, a response to the energy cr isis of that decade, achieved less than its 
initiators hoped.  In the Un ited States, however, we have seen many examples--in some 
cases extending back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries--of federal research - 5 - 
 
 
 initiatives and government support enabling th e emergence of new technologies in areas 
that include agriculture, chemicals, health care, and information technology.  A case that 
has been particularly well documented and cl osely studied is the development of hybrid 
seed corn in the United States duri ng the first half of the 20th century.4  Two other 
examples of innovations that r eceived critical federal support  are gene splicing--federal 
R&D underwrote the techniques that opened up th e field of genetic e ngineering--and the 
lithium-ion battery, which was developed by fede rally sponsored materials research in the 
1980s.  And recent research on the government ’s so-called war on cancer, initiated by 
President Nixon in 1971, finds that the effort has produced a very high social rate of 
return, notwithstanding its failure to achieve its  original, ambitious goa l of eradicating the 
disease.5 
What about the present?  Is government  support of R&D toda y at the “right” 
level?  This question is not easily answered ; it involves not only difficult technical 
assessments, but also a number of value judgments about public priorities.  As 
background, however, a consideration of recen t trends in expenditures on R&D in the 
United States and the rest of the world should be  instructive.  In the United States, total 
R&D spending (both public and private) has b een relatively stable over the past three 
decades, at roughly 2-1/2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).6  However, this 
apparent stability masks some important unde rlying trends.  First, since the 1970s, R&D 
spending by the federal government has trende d down as a share of GDP, while the share 
                                                 
4 See Griliches (1958).  
5 See Lakdawalla et al. (2010). 
6 In 2010, total U.S. R&D spending as a share of GDP was estimated to be 2.8 percent (Battelle and R&D 
Magazine , 2010).  For earlier data, see National Science Foundation (2010), table 13. - 6 - 
 
 
 of R&D done by the private sector  has correspondi ngly increased.7  Second, the share of 
R&D spending targeted to basic research, as opposed to more applied R&D activities, has 
also been declining.8  These two trends--the declines in the share of basic research and in 
the federal share of R&D spending--are re lated, as government R&D spending tends to 
be more heavily weighted toward basic res earch and science.  Th e declining emphasis on 
basic research is somewhat concerning becau se fundamental research is ultimately the 
source of most innovation, albeit often with long lags.  Indeed, some economists have 
argued that, because of the potentially high social return to basic research, expanded 
government support for R&D could, over ti me, significantly boost economic growth.9  
That said, in a time of fiscal stringency, the Congress and the Admi nistration will clearly 
need to carefully weigh competing prio rities in their budgetary decisions.   
Another argument sometimes made fo r expanding government support for R&D 
is the need to keep pace with technologi cal advances in other countries.  R&D has 
become increasingly international, thanks  to improved communication and dissemination 
of research results, the spread of scientif ic and engineering tale nt around the world, and 
the transfer of technologies th rough trade, foreign direct inve stment, and the activities of 
multinational corporations.  To be sure, R&D spending remains concentrated in the most-
                                                 
7 The federal share of total U.S. R&D spending was 26  percent in 2008, while th e private-sector share was 
67 percent. The remaining funding comes from universities and colleges, private foundations, and other nonprofits. Three decades prior, the federal and priv ate-sector shares were 50 percent and 46 percent 
respectively.  See table 5 in National Science Foundation (2010).   
8 See tables 6 through 8 in National Science Foundation (2010). 
9 For example, see Jones and Williams (1998).  Grilic hes (1992) reports estimates of the average social 
return that cluster in the range of 20 to 60 percent a year.  See also  Hall, Mairesse, and Mohnen (2009).  
The estimates in the literature are typically for average social returns; the return to an additional dollar of 
R&D spending, which is the relevant variable for determining whether further spending is warranted, may 
be lower than the average return. - 7 - 
 
 
 developed countries, with the United States still the leader in overall R&D spending.10   
However, in recent years, spending on R&D has increased sharply in some emerging market economies, most notably in China and India.  In particular, spending for R&D by 
China has increased rapidly in absolute te rms, although recent estimates still show its 
R&D spending to be smaller relative to GDP than in the United States.
11  Reflecting the 
increased research activity in emerging ma rket economies, the share of world R&D 
expenditures by member nations of the Or ganisation for Economic Co-Operation and 
Development, which mostly comprises advan ced economies, has fallen relative to non-
member nations, which tend to be less developed.  A similar trend is evident, by the way, with respect to science and engineering workforces.
12  
How should policymakers think about the increasing globalization of R&D 
spending?  On the one hand, the diffusion of scientific and t echnological research 
throughout the world potentially benefits ever yone by increasing the pace of innovation 
globally.  For example, the development of th e polio vaccine in the United States in the 
1950s provided enormous benefits to people globally, not just Americans.  Moreover, in a 
globalized economy, product and process i nnovations in one country can lead to 
employment opportunities and improved goods and services around the world.   
On the other hand, in some circumstan ces, the location of  R&D activity can 
matter.  For example, technological prowess may help a country reap the financial and 
                                                 
10 Among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) nations, the United States is 
estimated to have spent the most on R&D in 2010, followed by Japan, Germany, South Korea, France, and the United Kingdom (Battelle and R&D Magazine , 2010).  As a percentage of GDP, Israel ranked first 
among OECD nations in R&D spending, followed by Finland, Sweden, Japan, and South Korea (OECD, 
2010). 
11 China’s gross R&D expenditures are estimated to have increased more than five-fold between 1997 and 
2007 and, by 2010, are estimated to have been roughly on par with expenditures in Japan, the world’s 
second-largest spender on R&D, a lthough they were still about one-third the expenditures in the United 
States.  See National Science Foundation (2010) and Battelle and R&D Magazine  (2010).

 employment benefits of leadership in a stra tegic industry.  A cutting-edge scientific or 
technological center can create a variety of  spillovers that promote innovation, quality, 
skills acquisition, and productivity in industries located nearby ; such spillovers are the 
reason that high-tech firms often locate in  clusters or near leading universities.13  To the 
extent that countries gain from leadership in technologically vibran t industries or from 
local spillovers arising from inventive activ ity, the case for government support of R&D 
within a given country is stronger.14 
How Should Governments Provide Support  for Research and Development?  
The economic arguments for government support of innovation generally imply 
that governments should focus particularly on fo stering basic, or foundational, research.  
The most applied and commercia lly relevant research is lik ely to be done in any case by 
the private sector, as private firms have strong incentives to determine what the market 
demands and to meet those needs.15   
If the government decides to  foster R&D, what policy instruments should it use?  
A number of potential tool s exist, including direct f unding of government research 
facilities, grants to university or private-sect or researchers, contracts for specific projects, 
and tax incentives.  Moreover, within each of these categories, many choices must be 
made about how to structure specific programs.  Unfortunately, economists know less about how best to channel public support fo r research and development than we would 
like; it is good news, therefore, that consider able new work is being done on this topic, 
including recent initiatives on science policy by the National Science Foundation.

14 Another argument for fostering domestic innovation is that it may have national security implications. 
15 For example, see David, Hall, and Toole (2000) and Hall and van Reenen (2001).

 Certainly, the characteristics of the research to be s upported are important for the 
choice of the policy tool.  Di rect government support or c onduct of the research may 
make the most sense if the project is highl y focused and large-scal e, possibly involving 
the need for coordination of the work of many researchers and subject to relatively tight 
time frames.  Examples of large-scale, government-funded research include the space 
program and the construction and operati on of “atom-smashing”  facilities for 
experiments in high-energy physics.  Outside of such cases, which often are linked to 
national defense, a more decentralized model that relies on the ideas and initiative of 
individual researchers or sma ll research groups may be most effective.  Grants to, or 
contracts with, researchers are the ty pical vehicle for such an approach. 
Of course, the success of decentralized models for government support depends 
on the quality of execution. Some critics beli eve that funding agencies have been too 
cautious, focusing on a limited number of low -risk projects and targeting funding to 
more-established scientists at the expense of  researchers who are less established or less 
conventional in their approaches.  Supporting multiple approaches to a given problem at the same time increases the chance of finding a solution; it also increases opportunities 
for cooperation or constructive competition.
17  The challenge to policymakers is to 
encourage experimentation and a greater dive rsity of approaches while simultaneously 
ensuring that an effective peer-review process is in place to guide funding toward high-
quality science.18  
However it is channeled, government support for innovation and R&D will be 
more effective if it is thought of as a long -run investment.  Gestation lags from basic

 research to commercial applic ation to the ultimate economic benefits can be very long.  
The Internet revolution of the 1990s was base d on scientific investments made in the 
1970s and 1980s.  And today’s widespread  commercialization of biotechnology was 
based, in part, on key research findings deve loped in the 1950s.  Thus, governments that 
choose to provide support for R&D are likely to get better results if that support is stable, 
avoiding a pattern of feast or famine.19   
Government support for R&D presumes suffi cient national capacity to engage in 
effective research at the desired scale.  Th at capacity, in turn, depends importantly on the 
supply of qualified scientists, engineers, and other technical workers.  Although the 
system of higher education in the United Stat es remains among the finest in the world, 
numerous concerns have been raised about this country’s ability to ensure adequate 
supplies of highly skilled workers.  For exam ple, some observers have suggested that 
bottlenecks in the system limit the number of students receivi ng undergraduate degrees in 
science and engineering:  Surveys of student intentions in the United States consistently 
show that the number of stude nts who seek to major in sc ience and engineering exceeds 
the number accommodated by a wide margin, and wa itlists to enroll in technical courses 
have trended up relative to those in other fields, as has the ti me required to graduate with 
a science and engineering degree.20  Moreover, although the re lative wages of science 
and engineering graduates have increased si gnificantly over the past few decades, the 
share of undergraduate degrees awarded in science and engineering has been roughly 
stable.21  At the same time, critics of K-12 e ducation in the United States have long 
argued that not enough is being done to encour age and support student interest in science 
                                                 
19 See Freeman and van Reenen (2009).

 and mathematics.  Taken together, these tr ends suggest that more could be done to 
increase the number of U.S.  students entering scientific and engineering professions.  
At least when viewed from the perspe ctive of a single nation, immigration is 
another path for increasing the supply of highl y skilled scientists a nd researchers.  The 
technological leadership  of the United States was and con tinues to be built in substantial 
part on the contributions of  foreign-born scientists and engineers, both permanent 
immigrants and those staying in the country on ly for a time.  And, contrary to the notion 
that highly trained and talented immigrants  displace native-born workers in the labor 
market, scientists and other highly trained professionals who come to the United States 
tend to enhance the productivity and employ ment opportunities of those already here, 
reflecting gains from interaction and coopera tion and from the development of critical 
masses of researchers in technical areas.  More generally, tech nological progress and 
innovation around the world would be enha nced by lowering national barriers to 
international scientific co operation and collaboration.  
Conclusion  
In the abstract, economists have identifi ed some persuasive justifications for 
government policies to promote R&D activitie s, especially those related to basic 
research.  In practice, we know less than we  would like about which policies work best.  
A reasonable strategy for now may be to cont inue to use a mix of policies to support 
R&D while taking pains to encourage divers e and even competing approaches by the 
scientists and engine ers receiving support. 
We should also keep in mi nd that funding R&D activity is  only part of what the 
government can do to foster innovation.  As I noted, ensuring a sufficient supply of - 12 - 
 
 
 individuals with science and engineering skills is importa nt for promoting innovation, 
and this need raises questions about educa tion policy as well as immigration policy.  
Other key policy issues include the definiti on and enforcement of intellectual property 
rights and the setting of techni cal standards.  Finally, as someone who spends a lot of 
time monitoring the economy, let me put in a plug for more work on finding better ways 
to measure innovation, R&D activity, and intangib le capital.  We will be more likely to 
promote innovative activity if we are able to  measure it more effectively and document 
its role in economic growth.

 Good morning , and welcome.  It is a great pleasure to welcome all the attendees 
to RES 2022.  
The National Center for American Indian Enterprise Development has been a 
strong and consistent partner to the Federal Reserve , collaborating with us on small 
business COVID su rveys, serving on the Leadership Council for the Minneapolis Fed’s 
Center for Indian Country Development, and moderating our policy webinar series on 
tribal enterprise diversification, just to name a few.  
Trust is earned and developed through relationship s.  This is particularly 
important in Indian Country.  The Federal Reserve has built an enduring and sturdy bond 
with the National Center, and we value that partnership . 
We are excited to be participating in this year’s conference, learning alongside 
you.  There is undoubtedly more research and engagement to be done on the specific and 
unique economic needs of tribal nations and Indigenous communities.  RES 2022 is a 
great meeting ground for such collaboration.  
The best insight and analysis come from people  who live and work in 
communities and have an inside view of the struggles and opportunities within.  The 
Federal Reserve System has made a priority of engaging with leaders and stakeholders on 
opportunities most relevant to tribal economic prosperity.  Fo r example, input from tribal 
stakeholders has been invaluable to informing the important work of modernizing the 
Community Reinvestment Act, which was incorporated into the recently published 
proposal that we  are looking forward to getting comments on.  We  also value the growing 
representation of tribal voices on our boards of directors and advisory councils at Reserve 
Banks, helping us to better understand economic conditions in Indian Country.   
 - 2 - 
Many of you are aware of the  Center for Indian Country Develop ment (CICD), 
our national institute dedicated to helping tribes reach their full economic potential.  We 
are excited to be expanding its capacity to conduct economic research and data analysis 
to support the long -term economic prosperity of Indian Country,  in partnership with 
Indian Country.  We look forward to CICD’s ongoing collaboration with tribal 
communities  on research and data.    
Additionally, an initial  St. Louis  Fed partnership with the Osage Nation , to 
provide youth financial education , has led t o partnerships with tribal governments across 
the country t hat provide personal finance education, often in their Native languages.  
Tribal leaders nationwide have also joined recent listening sessions to discuss the impacts 
of inflation.  Similar sessions  were held on our pandemic response facilities, which were 
adapted after hearing their input.  
Other Federal Reserve partnerships with Indian Country include initiatives on 
access to credit; Native community development financial institutions ; financial 
education programs tailored to early childhood, secondary , and higher education; 
workforce development; housing; social services; and elder programs.  
And as part of our ongoing effort to deepen our understanding of tribal 
economies, last year, the Federal Res erve Board announced that we had joined the 
Central Bank Network for Indigenous Inclusion, along with the Reserve Bank of New 
Zealand, the Bank of Canada, and the Reserve Bank of Australia.  This is part of our 
commitment to learning best practices and exp anding our international partnerships with 
central banks that are similarly invested in supporting Indigenous people and 
communities.

The Federal Reserve works for all of us, and our research and analysis must 
reflect the specific needs and circumstances o f all of our communities.  I am grateful for 
our partnership with the National Center for American Indian Enterprise Development, 
and I want to thank you, as well as all our colleagues, advisors, and stakeholders who 
help us work toward a stable and inclus ive economy for all.  
Thank you. ",2022-05-24,powell

On the Implications of the Financial Crisis for Economics  
  
Remarks by  
 
Ben S. Bernanke  
 
Chairman  
 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  
 
at the 
 
Conference co -sponsored by  
 
the Bendheim Center for Finance and the Center for Economic Policy Studies  
 
Princeton , New Jersey  
       
September  24, 2010   
 Thank you for giving me this opportunity to return to Princeton.  It is good to be 
able to catch up with  old friends and colleagues and to see both the changes and the 
continuities on campus.  I am particularly pleased to see that the Bendheim Center for 
Finance is thriving.  When my colleagues and I  founded the center a decade ago, we 
intended it to be a place where students would learn about not only  the technicalities of 
modern financ ial theory and practice but also about  the broader  economic context of 
financial activities.   Recent events have made clear  that understanding the role of 
financial markets and institutions in the eco nomy, and of the effects of economic 
developments on finance, is more important than ever.  
The financial crisis that began more than three years ago has  indeed proved to be  
among the most difficult challenges for economic policymakers  since the Great 
Depression.  The  policy re sponse to this challenge has included important  successes , 
most notably the concerted  international effort to stabilize the global financial system 
after the crisis reached its worst point in the fall of 2008.  For its part, t he Federal Reserve 
worked closely with other policymakers, both domestic ally and international ly, to help 
develop t he collective response to the crisis, and it played a  key role  in th at response  by 
providing backstop liquidity to a range of financial institutions as needed  to stem the 
panic.  T he Fed  also developed special lending facilities that helped to restore normal  
functioning to critical financial markets , including the commercial paper market and the 
market for asset -backed securities ; led the bank stress tests in the spring of 2009 that 
significantly improved confidence in the U.S. banking system ; and, in the a rea of 
monetary policy, took aggressive and innovative actions  that helped  to stabilize the 
economy and lay the groundwork for recovery . -2- 
 
Despite  these and other  policy successes, the episode as a whole has not been kind 
to the reputation of economi c and economists , and understandably so.  Almost  
universally , economists failed to predict the  nature, timing, or severity of the  crisis ; and 
those few who issued early warnings generally identified only isolated  weaknesses in the 
system, not  anything approachin g the full set of complex linkag es and mechanisms that 
amplified the initial shocks and ultimately resulted in a devastating global crisis  and 
recession.   Moreover, although financial markets are for the most part  functioning 
normally now , a concerted poli cy effort has  so far not produced an economic recovery  of 
sufficient vigor  to significantly reduce the high level of unemployment.  As a result  of 
these developments , some observers have suggested the need for a n overhaul of 
economic s as a discipline , arguing  that much of the research in macro economics  and 
finance in recent decades has been of little value or even counterproductive .   
Although economists have much to learn from this crisis, as I will discuss, I  think 
that calls for  a radical re working  of the field go  too far.  In particular, it seems to me that 
current critique s of economics  sometimes conflate three overlapping yet separate 
enterprises, which , for the purposes of my remarks today, I will call  economic science, 
economic engineering, and economic management.  Economic science concerns itself 
primarily with theoretical and empirical generalizations about the behavior of individuals, 
institutions, markets, and national economies .  Most academic research falls in this 
category .  Economic engineering is about the design and analysis of frameworks  for 
achieving specific economic objectives .  Examples of such frameworks are the risk -
management systems of financial institutions and the financial regulat ory system s of the 
United States and other countries .  Economic management  involves the operation of  -3- 
 
economic frameworks  in real time --for example, in the private sector, the management of 
complex financial institutions or, in the public sector, the day -to-day supervision of those 
institutions .   
As you may have already guessed, m y terminology is intended to invoke a  loose 
analogy with science and engineering .  Underpinning any practical scientific  or 
engineering  endeavor, such as a moon shot , a heart transplant , or the construction of a 
skyscraper  are:  first, fundamental scientific knowledge ; second, principles of design and 
engineering , derived from experience and the application of fundamental knowledge ; and 
third, the management of the particular endeavor, often including the coordination of the 
efforts of many people i n a complex enterprise while dealing with myriad uncertainties.  
Success in any practical  undertaking  requires all three components.  For example, the 
fight to control AID S requires scientific knowledge about the causes and mechanisms of 
the disease (the scien tific component ), the development of medical technologies and 
public health strategies (the engineering  applications ), and the implementation of those 
technologies and strategies in specific communities and for individual patients  (the 
management  aspect ).  Twenty years ago, AIDS mortality rates mostly reflected gaps in 
scientific understanding and in the design of drugs and treatment technologies; today, the 
problem is more likely to be a lack of funding or trained personnel to carry out programs or to apply treatments.  
With that taxonomy in hand, I would argue that  the recent  financial crisis was 
more a failure of economic engineering and economic management  than of wha t I have 
called economic science.   The economic engineering problems were reflected in a 
number of structural weaknesses in our financial system .  In the private sector, these -4- 
 
weaknesses included  inadequate risk- measurement and risk -management systems at 
many financial firms  as well as shortcomings in some firms’ business models , such as 
overreliance on unstable short -term funding  and excessive leverage.  In the public sector , 
gaps and blind spots in the financial regulatory structure s of the United States and most 
other countries  proved particularly damaging.  These regulatory structures were designed 
for earlier eras  and did not adequately adapt to rapid change and innovation in the 
financial sector , such as the  increasing financial intermediation taking place outside of 
regulated depository institutions through the so- called shadow banking system .  In the 
realm of economic management, the leader s of financial firms, market participants, and 
government policymakers  either  did not reco gnize  important structural problems and 
emerging risks  or, when they identified them, did not respond sufficiently quickly or 
forcefully  to address them .  Shortcomings of what I have called economic science, in 
contrast, were for the most part  less central  to the crisis; indeed, a lthough the great 
majority of  economists did not foresee the  near -collapse of the financial system , 
economic analysis has proven and will continue to prove critical in understanding the 
crisis, in developing policies to contain it, and in designing longer -term solutions to 
prevent its recurren ce. 
I don’t want to push this analogy too far.  Economics  as a discipline  differs in 
important ways from science and engineering ; the latter, dealing as they do with 
inanimate objects rather th an willful human beings, can often be far more precise in their 
predictions.  Also, t he distinction between economic science and economic engineering 
can be less sharp than my analogy may suggest , as much economic research has direct 
policy implications.   And  although I don’t think the crisis by any means requires us to -5- 
 
rethink economics and finance from  the ground up, it did reveal importan t shortcomings  
in our understanding of certain aspects of  the interaction of financial markets, institutions, 
and the economy  as a whole, as I will discuss .  Certainly, the crisis should lead--indeed,  it 
is already leading --to a greater focus on research  related to financial instability and its  
implica tions for the broader economy.  
In the remainder of my remarks, I will  focus on the implications of the crisis for 
what I have been calling economic science, that is, basic economic research and analysis .  
I will first provide a few examples of  how economic principles and economic research , 
rather than having misled us, have  significantly enhanced  our understanding of the crisis 
and are informing the regulatory response.  However, the crisis did reveal some gaps in 
economists’  knowledge that should be remedied.  I will discuss some of these gaps  and 
suggest possible  direction s for future  research  that could  ultimately help  us achieve 
greater  financial and macro economic stability . 
How Economics Helped Us Understand and Respond to the Crisis  
 The financial crisis represented an enormously complex set of interactions --
indeed, a discussion of the triggers that touched off the crisis and the vulnerabilities in the financial system and in financial regulation that allowed the crisis to have such devastating effects  could more than fill my time this afternoon.

1 For a more comprehensive discussion of vulnerabilities and triggers during the financial crisis , see Ben S. 
Bernanke (2010), “Causes of the Recent Financial and Economic Crisi s,” testimony before the Financial 
Crisis Inquiry Commission, September 2, 
www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/bernanke20100902a.htm.    The complexity of our 
financial system , and the resulting difficulty of predicting how developments in one 
financial market or institution may affect the system as a whole , present ed formidable 
challenges.  But, at least in retrospect, economic principles and research were  quite useful -6- 
 
for understanding  key aspects of the crisis and for designing appropriate policy 
response s.  
For example, the excessive dependence of some financial firms on unstable short -
term funding led to runs on key institutions, with highly adverse implications for the 
functioning of the system as a whole.  The fact that dependence on unstable short -term 
funding could lead to run s is hardly new s to economists; it has been a central issue in  
monet ary economics sin ce Henry  Thornton and Walter B agehot wrote about the question 
in the 19th century .2
                                                 
2 See Henry Thornton ([1802] 1962), An E nquiry into the Nature and Effects of the Paper Credit of Great 
Britain  (New York:  A. M. Kelley); and Walter Bagehot ([1873] 1897), Lombard Street:  A Description of 
the Money Market  (New York:  Char les Scribner’ s Sons).  A discussion relating the Federal  Reserve's 
policy actions during the financial crisis to the ideas of Bagehot is contain ed in Brian F. Madigan (2009), 
“Bagehot’ s Dictum in Practice:  Formulating and Implementing Policies to Combat the Financial Crisis,” 
speech delivered at “Financial Sta bility and Macroeconomic Policy,”  a symposium sponsored by the 
Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson Hole, Wyo., August 20 -22, available at 
www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/madigan20090821a.htm .  See also Ben S. Bernanke (2008), 
“Liquidity Provision by the Federal Reserve,” speech delivered at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta 
Financial Markets Conference (via satellite), held in Sea Island, Ga., May 13, 
www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20080513.htm.    Indeed, the recent crisis  bore a striking resemblance to the bank 
runs that figured so prominently in Thornton’s and Bagehot’s eras ; but in this case, the 
run occurred outside the traditional banking system , in the  shadow banking system --
consisting of financial institutions other than regulated depository institutions , such as 
securitization vehicles, money market funds, and investment banks .  Prior to the crisis, 
these institutions had become increasingly dependent on various forms of short -term 
wholesale funding , as had some globally active commercial banks .  Examples of such 
funding include commercial paper, repurchase agreements (repos) , and securities lending .  
In the years immediately before the crisis, some of these forms of funding grew 
especially rapidly; for example, repo liabilities of U.S. broker -dealers increased by a -7- 
 
factor of 2 -1/2 in the four years before the crisis , and a good deal of this expansion 
reportedly funded holdings of relatively less  liquid securities.  
In the historically familiar  bank run during the era before deposit insurance , retail 
depositors who heard rumors about the health of their bank--whether true or untrue --
would line up to withdraw their funds.  If the run continued, then, absent intervention by 
the central bank or some other provider of liquidity, the bank would run out of the cash necessary  to pay off depositors and then fail  as a result .  Often, the panic would spread as  
other banks with similar characteristics to, or having a financial relationship with, the one 
that had failed came under suspicion.  In the recent crisis, money  market mutual funds  
and their investors, as well as other providers of short -term funding , were the economic 
equivalent of early -1930s retail depositors.  Shadow banks  relied on these providers to 
fund longer -term credit instruments, including securities backed by subprime  mortgages.  
After house prices began to decline, concerns began to build about the quality of subprime mortgage loans and, consequently, about the quality of the securities into which these and other forms of credit had been packaged.  Although many shadow banks had limited  exposure to subprime loans and other questionable cre dits, the complexity of the 
securities involved and the opaqueness of many of the financial arrangements made it difficult for investors to distinguish relative risks.  In an environment of heightened 
uncertainty,  many investors concluded that  simply withd rawing funds was the easier and 
more prudent alternative.   In turn, financial institutions, knowing the risks  posed by a run, 
began to hoard cash, which dried up liquidity  and significantly limited  their willingness 
to extend new credit .

Because the runs on the shadow banking system occurred in a historically 
unfamiliar context,  outside the commercial banking system, both the private sector and 
the regulators insufficiently anticipated the risk that such runs might occur .  However, 
once the threat bec ame apparent , two centuries of economic thinking on runs and panics 
were available to inform  the diagnosis and the policy response .  In particular, in the 
recent episode, central banks around the world followed the dict um set forth by  Bagehot  
in 1873:   To avert  or contain panics, central banks should lend freely to solvent 
institutions, against good collateral.4

(2009), “Deciphering the Liquidity and Credit Crunch 2007- 2008,”  Journal of Economic Perspectives , 
vol. 23 (Winter), pp. 77 -100.   The Federal Reserve indeed acted quickly to 
provide liquidity to the banking system , for example, by easing lending terms at the 
discount window and establishing regular auctions in which banks could bid for term  
central bank  credit .  Invoking emergency  powers not used since the 1930s, the Fed eral 
Reserve also found ways to provide liquidity to critical parts of the shadow banking 
system, includ ing securities dealers, the commercial paper market, money market mutual 
funds, and the asset -backed securities market.  For today’s purposes, my point is not to 
review this history but instead  to point out that, in its policy response, the Fed was relying 
4 Bagehot also suggested that “these loans should only be made at a very high rate of interest” ( Lombard 
Street, p. 99; see note 2 ).  Some modern commentators have rationalized Bagehot’s dictum to lend at a high 
or “penalty” rate as a way to mitigate moral hazard --that is, to help maintain in centives for private -sector 
banks to provide for adequate liqu idity in advance of any crisis.  However,  the risk of moral hazard did not 
appear to be Bagehot’s principal motivation for recommending a high rate; rather, he saw it as a tool to 
dissuade unnec essary borrowing and thus help protect the Bank of England’s own finite store of liquid 
assets.   See Bernanke, “Liquidity Provision,” in note 2 for further documentation.   Today, potential 
limitations on the central bank’s lending capacity are not nearly s o pressing an issue as in Bagehot’s time, 
when the central bank’s ability to provide liquidity was far more tenuous.  Generally, the Federal Reserve lent at rates above the “normal” rate for the market but lower than the rate prevailing in distressed and 
illiquid markets.  This strategy provided needed liquidity while encouraging borrowers to return to private 
markets when conditions normalized.  -9- 
 
on well -developed economic ideas that have deep historical roots .5
Economic research and analysis  have proved useful in understanding many other 
aspects of the crisis  as well .  For example, one of the most important  developments in 
economic s over recent decades has been the flowering of information economics, which 
studies how incomplete information or differences in information among economic 
agents affect market outcomes.  The  problem  in this 
case was not  a lack of professional understanding of  how runs come about or how central 
banks and other a uthorities should respond to them .  Rather, the problem was the  failure  
of both private - and public -sector actors to recognize the potential for runs in an 
institutional context quite different than the  circumstances  that had given rise to such 
events in t he past .  These failures in turn were partly the result of a regulatory structure 
that had not adapted adequately to the rise of shadow banking and that placed insufficient emphasis on the detection of systemic risks, as opposed to risks to individual inst itutions 
and markets.

5 A substantial modern literature has updated and formalized many of the insights of Bagehot and 
Thornton.  A cla ssic example is Douglas W. Diamond and Philip H. Dybvig (1983), “Bank Runs, Deposit 
Insurance, and Liquidity” Journal of Political Economy , vol. 91 (3) , pp. 401- 19.   An important branch of information economics, 
principal -agent theory, considers the implications of differences in information between 
the principal s in a relationship ( say, the  shareholder s of a firm ) and the  agents  who work 
for the principal s (say, the firm’s managers ).  Because the agent typically has more 
information than the principal --managers tend to know more about the fi rm’s 
opportunities and problems than do the shareholders , for example --and because the 
financial  interests of the principal and the agent are not perfectly aligned, much depends

their leadership in the development of information economics.  -10- 
 
on the contract (whether explicit or implicit)  between the principal and the agent, and, in 
particular, on the incentives that the contract provide s the agent.   
Poorly structured incentives were pervasive in the crisis.  For example, 
compensation practices at financial institutions, which often tied b onuses to short -term 
results and made insufficient adjustments for risk, contributed to an environment in 
which both top managers  and lower -level employees , such as traders and loan officers, 
took excessive risks.  Serious problems with the structure of in centives also emerged  in 
the application of the so- called originate- to-distribute model to subprime mortgages.  To 
satisfy the strong demand for securitized products, both mortgage lenders and those who packaged the loans for sale to investors were compens ated primarily on the quantity of 
“product” they moved through the system.  As a result , they paid less attention to credit 
quality and many loans were made without sufficient documentation or care in underwriting .  Conflicts of interest at credit agencies , which were supposed  to serve 
investors but had incentives to help issuers of securities obtain high credit ratings, are another example.    
Consistent with key aspects of research in information  economics, t he public 
policy responses to these problems have focused on improving market participants ’ 
incentives .  For example, t o address problems with compensation practices, the Federal 
Reserve, in conjunction with other supervisory agencies, has subjected compensation  
practices of banking institutions to supervisory review.  The interagency supervisory guidance supports compensation practices that induce employees to take a longer -term 
perspective,  such as paying part of  employees ’ compensation  in stock that vests based on 
sustained strong performance .  To ameliorate the problems with the originate -to--11- 
 
distribute model, recent legislation requires regulatory agencies, including the Federal 
Reserve, to develop new standards applicable to securitization activities that would better align the incentives faced b y market participants involved  in the various stages of the 
securitization process.
7
Information economics and principal -agent theory are also essential to 
understanding the problems created by so -called  too-big-to-fail financial institutions.   
Prior to the crisis, market participants believed that large, complex, and interconnected financ ial firms would not be allowed to fail during a financial crisis .  And, as you know, 
authorities both in the United States and abroad did in fact intervene on a number of occasions to prevent the failure of such firms --not out of any special consideration for the 
owners, managers, or creditors  of these firms , but because of legitimate concern s about 
potential damage to the financial system and the broader economy .  However, although 
the instability caused by the failure or near -failure  of some large firms did indeed prove 
very costly, in some sense the real damage was d one before the crisis.  I f creditors in   And the Securities and Exchange Commission has been charged 
with developing new rules to reduce conflicts of interest at credit rating agencies.  
                                                 
7 The requirements related to credit risk were contained in section 941 of the Dodd- Frank Wall Street 
Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Pub. L. No. 111- 203 (July 2010);  with regard to compensation 
practices, see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2009), “ Federal Reserve Issues Proposed 
Guidance on Incentive Compensation, ” press release, October 22, 
www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20091022a.htm ; also see Board of Governors of the 
Federal Reserve System (2010), “ Federal Reserve, OCC, OTS, FDIC Issue Final Guid ance on Incentive 
Compensation,”  joint press release, June 21, 
www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20100621a.htm . 
 Why might gove rnment intervention be needed to improve private -sector incentives, when incentives 
presumably exist for the private- sector principals and agents to work out the best incentive structure for 
themselves?  The possibility of problems arising regarding c ollec tive action when a firm has  many 
shareholders is one rationale.  The standard reason for intervening in banks’ risk -taking practices is the 
existence of deposit insurance, which itself distorts private risk -taking incentives by eliminating any 
incentive of  depositors to monitor the activities of their bank; for an early discussion, see John Kareken and 
Neil Wallace (1978), “Deposit Insurance and Bank Regulation:  A Partial- Equilibrium Exposition,” 
Journal of Business , vol. 51 (July), pp.  413-38.  Indeed, th e Federal Reserve invoked a “safety and 
soundness” rationale for its guidance on incentive compensation practices.  More generally, as the crisis 
revealed, bad incentives can lead to problems that affect not just the individuals involved but the broader 
financial system as well; such spillovers suggest that regulation can help improve outcomes.  
 -12- 
 
good times believe that certain firms will not be allowed to fail, they will demand 
relatively little compensation for risk, thus weakening market discipline; in addition, creditors will not have much incentive to monitor the firm s’ risk -taking.  As a result, as 
predicted by principal -agent theory, firms thought to be too big to fail tend ed to take on 
more risk, as they faced little pressure from investor s and expect ed to receive as sistance 
if their bets went  bad.  This problem is an example of what e conomists refer to as moral 
hazard.  The resulting  buildup of risk in too- big-to-fail firms increase d the likelihood that 
a financial crisis would occur and  worsen ed the crisis when it did occur.  
One response to excessive risk -taking is stronger oversight by regulators, and the 
recent legislation and the rules and procedures being developed by the Federal Reserve and other agencies will subject systemically c ritical firms to tougher regulatory 
requirements and stricter supervision.  The Federal Reserve has also been involved in international negotiations to raise the capital and liquidity that banks are required to hold.   However, t he problem of too- big-to-fail can only be eliminated when market participants 
believe authorities ’ statements  that they will not intervene to prevent failures.  If creditors 
believe that the government will not rescue firms when their bets go bad, then creditors  
will have more -appropriate incentives to price, monitor , and limit the risk -taking of the 
firms to which they lend.  The best way to achieve such credibility is to create institutional arrangements under which a failure can be allowed to occur without widespread collateral da mage; if failures can take place more safely, the authorities will 
no longer have an incentive to try to avoid them.  The financial reform legislation took an important step in this direction by creating a resolution regime under which large, complex financial firms can be placed in receivership, but which also gives the -13- 
 
government the flexibility to take the actions needed  to safeguard systemic stability.  T his 
new regime should help restore m arket discipline by putting a greater burden on creditors 
and counterparties to monitor the risk- taking of large financial firms . 
The insights of economists  proved valuable to policymakers in many other 
contexts  as well :  in the setting and oversight of ba nk capital standards , in the decision to 
provide the market with extensive information gleaned during the bank stress tests in the 
spring of 2009, in the design of the Fed’s liquidity facilities for nondeposit ory 
institution s, in the analysis of the collap se of the securitization market , and in the 
measures taken to protect consumers from deceptive or inappropriate lending , to name a 
few.  Many of the key ideas, like those of Thornton and Bagehot, were quite old, but some reflected relatively recent research.  For example, recent work on monetary policy helped the Federal Reserve provide further policy accommodation despite  the constraints 
imposed by the zero lower bound on interest rates.

Economics  and Economic Research  in the Wake of the Crisis    
Economic principles and research have been central to understanding and reacting 
to the crisis.   That said, the crisis  and its lead up also challenged some important 
economic principles and research agendas.  I will briefly indicate some areas that,  I 
believe, would benefit from more attention from the economics profession.  
                                                 
8The Federal Reserve did so by, for example, (1) acting rapidly when confronted with the zero lower 
bound, as discussed in David Reifschneider and John C. Williams (2000), “Three Lessons for Monetary 
Policy in a Low -Inflation Era,” Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, vol. 32 (November), pp. 936- 66; (2) 
providing forward guidance regarding short -term interest rates, as discussed in Gauti Eggertsson and 
Michael Woodf ord (2003), “The Zero Bound on Interest -Rates and Optimal Monetary Policy,” Brookings 
Papers on Economic Activity , vol. 2003 (1), pp. 139- 211; and (3) expanding the Federal Reserve’s balance 
sheet through purchases of longer -term securities, as discussed i n Ben S. Bernanke, Vincent R. Reinhart, 
and Brian P. Sack (2004), “Monetary Policy Alternatives at the Zero Bound:  An Empirical Assessment,” 
Brookings Papers on Economic Activity , vol. 2004 (2), pp. 1- 78.  -14- 
 
Most fundamentally, and perhaps most challenging for researchers, the crisis 
should motivate economists to think further about their modeling of human behavior.  
Most economic research ers continue to work within the classic al paradigm that assumes 
rational, self -interested behavior  and the maximization of “expected utility”--a 
framework based on a formal description of risky situations and a theory of individual choice that has  been very usef ul through its integration of economics, statistics, and 
decision theory.
9
The idea that, at certain times, decisionmakers simply cannot assign meaningful 
probabilities to alternative outcomes --indeed, cannot even think of all the possible 
outcomes --is known as Knightian uncertainty, after the economist Frank Knight w ho   An important assumption of that framework is that, in making 
decisions under uncertainty, economic agents can assign meaningful probabilities to alternative outcomes.  However, dur ing the worst phase of the financial crisis, many 
economic actors --including investors, employers, and consumers --metaphorically  threw 
up their hands and admitted that, given the extreme and, in some ways, unprecedented nature of the crisis, they did not know what they did not know.  Or, as Donald Rumsfeld might have put it, there were too many “unknown unknowns .”  The profound unc ertainty 
associated with the “unknown unknowns” during the crisis resulted in panicky selling by investors, sharp cuts in payrolls by employers, and significant increases in households’ precautionary saving.  
                                                 
9 Herein I use the extension of Von Neumann -Morge nstern expected utility, which focused on objective 
probabilities over risks, to situations in which individuals assign subjective probabilities over risks.  For a 
review of some classic contributions in this area, see Jacques H. Dr èze (1974), “Axiomatic T heories of 
Choice, Cardinal Utility and Subjective Probability:  A Review,” in Jacques H. Dr èze, ed., Allocation under 
Uncertainty:  Equilibrium and Optimality  (London:  Macmillan), pp. 3- 23.  Some authors have used risk  to 
refer to a situation of objective probabilities and uncertainty  to refer to a situation of subjective 
probabilities (see, for example, David M. Kreps (1990), A Course in Microeconomic Theory  (Princeton, 
N.J.:  Princeton University Press)).  As highlighted below, others refer to uncertainty as a situation in which subjective probabilities cannot be assessed.  As this discussion makes clear, it is probably best to focus on 
the context in which the terms risk  and uncertainty  are used.  -15- 
 
discussed the idea in the 1920s.  Although economists and psychologists have long 
recognized the challenges such ambiguity presents and  have analyzed  the distinction 
between risk aversion and ambiguity aversion, much of this work has been abstract and relatively little progress has been made in describing and pr edicting the behavior of 
human being s under  circumstances in  which their knowledge and ex perience provide 
little useful information .
10
Another  issue that  clearly needs more attention is the formation and propagation 
of asset  price bubbles.  Scholars did a great deal of  work on bubbles  after the collapse of 
the dot -com bubble a decade ago, much of it quite interesting, but the profession seems 
still quite far from consensus and from being able to provide  useful advice to 
policymakers.  Much of the literature at this point addresses how bubbles persist and expand in circumstances where we would generally think they should not , such as when 
all agents know of the existence of a bubble or when sophisticated arbitrageurs operate in a market .  As it was put by my former colleague, Markus Brunnermeier , a scholar 
affiliated with the Bendheim center who has done important research on bubbles , “We do 
not have many convincing models that explain when and why bubbles start.”  Research  in this area could aid our understanding of crises  
and other extreme situations.  I suspect that progress will r equire careful empirical 
research with attention to psychological as well as economic factors .

10 The classic referen ce on ambiguity aversion is due to Daniel Ellsberg (1961) , “Risk, Ambiguity, and the 
Savage Axioms ,” The Quarterly Journal of Economics , vol. 75 (4), pp. 643 -69; for a more recent, and 
abstract, theoretical treatment, see Larry G. Epstein (1999), “A Defini tion of Uncertainty Aversion,”  
Review of Economic Studies , vol. 66 (July),  pp. 579-608.     I would 
add that we also don’t know very much about how bubbles  stop eithe r, and better

understanding this process --and its implications for the household, business, and financial 
sector s--would be very helpful in the design of  monetary and regulatory policies. 
Another  issue  brought to the fore by the crisis is the  need to better understand the 
determinants of liquidity in financial markets.  The notion that financial assets can always 
be sold at prices close to their fundamental values is built into most economic analysis, and before the crisis , the liquidity of ma jor markets  was often  taken for granted by 
financial market participants and regulators alike.  The crisis showed, however, that  risk 
aversion, imperfect information , and market dynamics can  scare away buyers and  badly 
impair  price discovery.  Ma rket illiq uidity also interacted with financial panic in 
dangerous ways.  Notably, a vicious circle sometimes developed in which investor concerns about the solvency of financial firms led to runs :  To obtain critically needed 
liquidity, firms were forced to sell as sets quickly , but these “ fire sales ” drove down asset 
prices and reinforced investor concerns about the solvency of the firms.  Importantly, this 
dynamic contributed to the profound blurring of the distinction between illiquidity and insolvency during the crisis.  Studying liquidity and illiquidity is difficult because it requires going beyond standard models of market clearing to examine the motivations and interactions of buyers and sellers over time.
12
I have been discussing needed research in  microeconomics and financial 
economics but have not yet touched on macroeconomics.  Standard macroeconomic   However, with regulators prepared to 
impose new liquidity requirements on financial institutions and to require changes in the operations of key markets to en sure normal functioning  in times of stress , new policy -
relevant research  in this area would be most welcome.

models, such as the workhorse new -Keynesian model, did not  predict the crisis, nor did 
they incorporate  very easily  the effects of  financial instability.  Do these  failure s of 
standard macro economic  models mean that they are irrelevant or at least significantly 
flawed?  I think the answer is a qualified no.  Economic models are useful only in the 
context for which they are designed.  Most of the time, including during recessions , 
serious financial instability is not an issue.   The standard models were designed for these 
non-crisis periods, and they have proven quite useful in that context.  Notably, they were 
part of the intellectual f ramework that helped deliver low inflation and macroeconomic 
stability in most industrial countries during  the two decades that began in the mid -1980s. 
That said, understanding the relationship between financial and economic stability 
in a macroeconomic co ntext is a critical unfinished task for researchers.  Earlier  work that 
attempted  to incorporate  credit and financial intermediation into the study of economic 
fluctuations and the transmission of monetary policy represents one possible starting point.  To give an example that I know particularly well, much of my own research as an academic (with coauthors such as Mark Gertler and Simon Gilchrist)  focused on the role 
of financial factors in propagating and am plifying business cycles.  Gertler and Nobuhiro  
Kiyotaki have further developed that basic framework to look at the macroeconomic 
effects of financial crises.

13 See Mark Gertler and Nobuhiro Kiyotaki (forthcoming), Handbook of Monetary Economics ; the paper is 
available at www.econ.nyu.edu/user/gertlerm/gertlerkiyotakiapril6d.pdf.    More generally , I am encourag ed to see the large number of 
recent studies that have incorporated banking and credit creation in standard macroeconomic models, though most of this work is still some distance from capturing -18- 
 
the complex interactions of risk -taking, liquidity, and capital i n our financial system and 
the implications of these factors for economic growth and stability.14
It would also be fruitful, I think, if “closed- economy” macroeconomist s would 
look more carefully at the work of international economists  on financial crises .  Drawing 
on the substantial experience in emerging  market economies, international economists 
have examined the origins and economic effects of banking and currency crises in some 
detail.   They have also devoted considerable research to the international  contagion of 
financial crises, a related topic that is of obvious relevance to our recent experience.      
Finally, macroeconomic modeling must accommodate the possibility of 
unconventional monetary policies, a number of which have been used during the crisi s.  
Earlier work on this topic relied primarily on the example of Japan; now, a number of data points can be used.  For example, the experience of the United States and the United 
Kingdom with large -scale asset purchases could be explored to improve our 
understanding of the effects of such transactions on longer -term yields and how such 
effects can be incorporated into modern models of the term structure of interest rates.

Conclusion  
I began my remarks by  drawing the distinction between the scientific, 
engineering, and management aspects of economics.  For the most part, in my view, the 
financial crisis reflected problems in  what I referred to as  economic engineering and 
economic management.  Both private -sector arrangements (for example, for risk 
management and funding) and the financial regulatory framework were flawed in design and execution, and these weaknesses were the primary reasons that the financial crisis and its economic effects were so severe.  
Disasters require urgent action to prevent repetition.  E ngineers seek to enhance 
the reliability of a complex machine through improvements in basic design; more -
rigorous  testing and quality assurance; and increases in the resilience of the machine 
through means such as stronger materials, greater redundanc y, and better backup systems.  
Economic policymakers’ efforts to avoid, or at least mitigate , future financial crises  are 
proceeding along analogous lines .  First, the recent reform legislation has improv ed the 
design of the regulatory framework, closing important gaps  such as the lack of oversight 
of the shadow banking system.  Likewise, in the private se ctor, firms have taken 
significant steps to improve their systems for managing risk  and liquidity .  Second, to 
reduce the probability and severity  of future cris es, policymakers will monitor  the system 
more intensive ly.  For example, the recent legislation creates a Financial Stability 
Oversight Council, made up of the heads of the fi nancial regulatory age ncies, which  will 
assess potential risks to the financial system, identify regulatory gaps, and coordinat e the 
efforts of the various agencies.  Enhanced market discipline, the result of a new resolution regime for systemically critical firms and a number of measures to increase -20- 
 
transparency, will complement regulatory oversight.  Finally, numerous steps, both 
prescribed in the legislation and taken independently by regulators, will work to make our financial system more resilient to shocks.  Examples inclu de rules that will strengthen 
key financial utilities, toughen bank capital and liquidity standards , and require that more 
derivative s instruments be standardized and traded on exchanges  rather than over the 
counter . 
Economic engineering is effective only in combination with good economic 
management.   For its part, the Federal Reserve has revamped its supervisory operations 
to provide more effective and comprehensive oversight.  In particular, we are taking an approach that is both more multi -disciplinary --making  greater use of the Federal 
Reserve’s wide expertise in macroeconomics, finance, and other fields to complement the work of bank supervisors; and more macroprudential --that is, focused on risks to the 
system as a whole as well as those to individual institutions.  Together, better design  of 
private - and public -sector frameworks for managing risk , better monitoring and 
supervision, and a more resilient financial system do not by any means  guarantee that  
financial crises will not recur , but they should both reduce the risk of crises and mitigate 
the effects of any that do happen.  
  In short, the  financial crisis did not discredit the usefulness of economic research 
and analysis by any means; indeed, both older and more recent ideas drawn from economic research have proved  invaluable to policymakers attempting to diagnose and 
respond to the financial crisis.  However , the crisis has raised some important questions 
that are already occupying researchers and should continue to do so.  As I have discussed today, more work is needed on the behavior of economic agents in times of profound -21- 
 
uncertainty; on asset  price bubbles and the determinants of market liquidity; and on the 
implications of financial factors, including financial instability, for macroeconomics and 
monetary policy.  Much of that work is already under way at the Bendheim c enter and in 
the Department of Economics here at Princeton.  ",2010-09-24,bernanke

Thank you, Gigi and Scott, and thanks to everyone for your  work in bringing us 
together today, particularly the Economic Education Group.  Congratulations on the 
launch of Economic Education Month as well.  We’re very proud of this initiative and 
looking forward to what you have in store for us in October.  
It’s a  pleasure to be here, albeit in a very different format than we’re used to.   The 
downside is that we don’t get to connect in quite the same way as we do in person.  The 
upside is that we’re able to include a lot more people. And wear much more comfortable 
clothes.  
Before I turn to your questions, I want to say a few words to recognize the 
incredibly powerful work you all do as teachers.  It would be important to mention this in 
any year, but especially now, in the 17th month of our upended reali ty.  At the Fed, we 
take the value and responsibility of public service pretty seriously, and there really is no 
greater contribution to the common good than teaching.  
The pandemic has been tough on everyone, but it has asked more of some than 
others.  Making it through this time has been no small feat for anyone, but teachers 
deserve distinct praise and appreciation.  Educators have had to restructure their teaching, 
adapt to new platforms, and help their students make their way through added stresses and pitfalls.  That must have been especially tough without the day- to-day interactions 
that help you connect .  It is clear that so many teachers have gone above and beyond the 
call of duty to remain a consistent, reliable resource for their students.  
Parent s deserve a shout -out as well for their part in helping reconstruct something 
as enormous and consequential as our entire education system.   - 2 - 
And students have also shown remarkable courage and resilience.  For all of us, 
daily life has been disrupted, miles tones like birthdays and graduations have been missed, 
and a once -in-a-lifetime crisis has cast a shadow of insecurity and uncertainty.  But to 
take on that burden as a formative experience is extraordinary.  You should all feel proud.  
Finding the bright side to the past 17 months is  not easy, but t he crisis has given 
us a unique opportunity to see the big picture and consider our place in it.  This is a 
historical inflection point,  and this generation of students is in a position to turn its 
lessons into profound tools of change.  
And I hope some of you will use those tools in public service.  
The students here today are the policymakers and legislators of the future.  Your 
teachers are the ones with the daunting task of preparing you for that future.  
You will see the world differently than your predecessors.  You have been forced, 
sooner than most people, to consider what in life is truly important.  You have seen a 
world upended, but you  have also seen a world that  is rapidly changing—sometimes 
more in one week than some of us have experienced over the course of decades.  I hope 
this will cause you to think about how you want to make your mark , knowing that thi ngs 
do change, and sometimes they change quickly.   
This is an extraordinary time, and  I believe t hat it will result in an extraordinary 
generation. As long as we continue to have extraordinary educators to guide them there.  
Education is the foundation of our  econom y, indeed,  of our society.  Teachers 
have always been tasked with nurturing and overseei ng our most valuable national 
resource.  It is the highest call within the higher calling of public service.  I want to thank  - 3 - 
all of the teachers —those here today and the rest across the country—as well as the 
parents and students who have come together to  make it through the past year and a half.  
Thank you, and I look forward to your questions . ",2021-08-17,powell

“Central Banking:  Before, During, and After the Crisis”  
 
A Conference Sponsored by the  
 
Federal Reserve Board and the International Journal of Central Banking  
 
Washington , D.C.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
March  23, 201 2 
Distinguished guests, colleagues, and friends:  It is my privilege to welcome you 
to this conference on “Central Banking:  Before, During, and After the Crisis,” which is 
jointly sponsored by the Federal Reserve Board and the International Journal of Centr al 
Banking .1  We hope that t he conference will foster discussion among policymakers and 
researchers about the evolving challenges facing central banks ar ound the world.  To help 
get that discussion started, the conference will feature  original research on monetary 
policy, macroprudential regulation, and the provision of liquidity, topics that are 
obviously highly relevant to the public policy missions of the Federal Reserve and other 
central banks.   The proceedings from this conference will be publishe d in a special issue 
of the journal  and disseminated to researchers in central banks and academic institutions 
worldwide.  
Needless to say, the e vents of the past few years pose serious challenges to the 
conventional, pre -crisis views and approaches of central b anks and other financial 
supervisors.  The crisis, the recession it sparked, and the subsequent slow recovery, 
especially in the advanced economies,  have demonstrate d that we have much to learn 
about the workings and vulnerabilities of our modern, globaliz ed financial system and its 
interactions with the broader economy.  In  responding to these stressful financial and 
economic developments , the Federal Reserve and other central banks have had to deploy 
a variety of new tools and approaches to carry out thei r responsibilities regarding 
monetary  policy and the provision of liquidity , tools about which we still have more to 
learn.   Finally, in the wake of the crisis, the Federal Reserve and other regulatory 
agencies have been charged with challenging new respon sibilities in the area of

macroprudential supervision, with the objective of promoting  financial stability and 
reducing  the likelihood and the costs of a future financial crisis.   Although much progress 
has been made, we are still at an early stage in understanding how best to meet these new 
macroprudential responsibilities.  
All of these developments have spurred a great deal of research within central 
banks, in academia, and else where.  This outpouring of research will help shape future 
central bank doctrine and policy approaches  and, most importantly, should help central 
banks better  carry out their mission to promote the public welfare .  The papers at this 
conference make a vari ety of welcome contributions  to this endeavor .  Two contributions 
consider the implications of recent events for the conduct of monetary policy, both 
conventional and unconventional .2  Another paper addresses  the relationship between 
monetary aggregates an d financial stability.3  And several  papers investigate issues in the 
field of regulation and macroprudential supervision, including the design of an integrated 
framework for regulation, a proposal for dealing with systemically  important resolution 
issues in the rep urchase agreement  markets, and a r eview of the progress to date in 
reengineering the financial system .4

Small Business es and  the Recovery

National Small Business Week Event  
 
U.S. Chamber of Commerce

Thank you, Administrator Contreras -Sweet,  I am pleased to be at the U.S. 
Chamber , to have this opportunity to be part of Small Business Week , and to meet the 
outstanding entrepreneurs here this evening.  I am also grateful to be able to share a few 
thoughts on the important role I believe small businesses have played and will continue to 
play in America’s recovery from the financial crisis and the Great Recession.   
After the onset of the crisis, the Feder al Reserve took extraordinary steps to 
stabilize the financial system and halt the plunge in economic activity.  Since then, the 
Fed has continued to use its monetary policy tools to promote the recovery and make 
progress toward our mandated objectives of maximum employment and price stability.  
By putting downward pressure on interest rates, the Fed is trying to make financial 
conditions more accommodative --supporting asset values and lower borrowing costs for 
households and businesses and thus encouraging  the spending that spurs job creation and 
a stronger recovery.  
Crucial to this process, as I just mentioned, is job creation.  The Fed eral Reserve  
tries to promote the conditions to foster job creation, but , overwhelmingly , it is 
businesses that create the  jobs.  About 85 percent of nonfarm employment is in the 
private sector, which traditionally is the source of a similarly large share of new jobs 
during economic expansions.  So far during this expansion, public -sector employment 
has declined and the priva te sector has accounted for all of the net increase in 
employment, so businesses have been even more crucial to job creation than usual.  
Small businesses, of course, are responsible for a large share of these new jobs.  
According to the latest data from th e Labor Department, a little more than half of the net 
number of jobs created since employment began growing in 2010 has been generated by  
 - 2 - 
firms with fewer than 250 employees, and most of that amount was accounted for by  
firms with fewer than 50 employees.1   
One of the reasons I wanted so much to be here this evening was to be able to 
acknowledge these important contributions.  America has come a long way since the dark 
days of the financial crisis, and small businesses deserve a considerable share of the 
credit for the investment and hiring that have brought that progress.  Although w e have 
come far , it is also true that we have further to go to achieve a healthy economy, and I  am 
certain that small businesses will continue to play a critical role in reach ing that 
objective.  
I am honored to be addressing the owners of 53 small businesses whose 
excellence exemplifies the enormous contributions that millions of small businesses 
collectively make to our economy.  You come from different places and have achiev ed 
success in a wide variety of ways, but you all share the entrepreneurial spirit that has 
always been central to our nation’s prosperity.  We at the Federal Reserve are keenly 
aware of your vital role , and we pledge to continue to do our part in promotin g the 
recovery so that you can continue to help America grow and prosper.  
Thank you.

“Strong Foundations:  The Economic Future s of Kids and Communities ,” the  
10th Biennial Federal Reserve System Community Development Research Conference   
 
 
Washington, D.C.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
March 23 , 2017 
  
I woul d like to welcome all of you and thank  you for joining us to discuss a set of 
topics of considerable importance to our country.   This is the Federal Reserve’s 10th 
biennial community development research conference, dedicated as always to issues of 
significance to people and communities around the country.  The conference is 
cosponsored  by, and includes substantive contributions f rom, the community 
development offices of all 12 Federal Reserve Banks as well as the Board of Governors.  
That united effort and level of commitment reflects how consequential we consider these 
issues to be.  This conference is intended to present and hig hlight rigorous research that I 
am confident will inform how you think about your own work, whether from the 
perspective of policymaking, community development practice, or research.  
Our last conference, two years ago, explored various aspects of economic 
mobility, largely among adults.  This year, we gather to discuss “The Economic Futures 
of Kids and Communities,” and , in part , I see this topic as an extension of that earlier 
conversation about mobility.   
Today and tomorrow, we focus on research about th e foundation or building 
blocks for economic success that are laid even before young people enter the workforce 
and assume responsibility for their own finances.  
 We will hear from leading experts on a range of issues related to how children, 
youth s, and young adults are shaped in ways that may ultimately affect their ability later 
to productive ly contribu te to the economy and manage their finances .  We can learn from 
what the data and analysis  tell us, and our hope is that making use of this information w ill 
lead to more effective programs and policies and thus better outcomes.   - 2 - 
Considerable evidence shows that growing up poor makes it harder to succeed as 
an adult, and new research by the Fed likewise shows the strong connection between the 
typical experi ences of poverty in childhood and economic challenges later as an adult.  
The data come from the Board’s latest Survey of Household Economics and 
Decisionmaking (SHED), which will be published later this spring.1  In the most recent 
survey, we asked some o f the younger respondents --aged 25 to 39 --to think about their 
childhood s.  We asked th ose young adults whether, during their childhoods, they found 
themselves worrying about having enough food to eat, having a stable caregiver, or about 
their personal saf ety.  About 10 percent said they regularly worried about one or more of 
these concerns, and an additional 19 percent said they sometimes worried about them.  
We were then able to compare responses about their experience s in childhood to 
what these young adu lts told us about their current circumstances.   Some pretty clear 
patterns  emerged .  Of those young adults who regularly had one or more of these 
childhood concerns growing up, more than one-half say that they are currently facing 
challenges in getting by financially.  This fraction  compares to just over one-fourth  of 
those who said they never, or only rarely, worried about these concerns as children that 
now experience this level of financial challenge.   Young adults who regularly or 
sometimes worried when they were children about their care, safety, or having enou gh to 
eat are also less likely to be employed, less likely to have consistent income month -to-

month, and less likely to be able to pay all of their current monthly bills in full, compared 
with those who never or rarely worried about these concerns as child ren.2 
  Broadly speaking, children who grow up in insecure circumstances, those often 
experienced in poverty, seem disproportionately likely to experience financial insecurity 
as adults.  This conference is about understanding what kinds of environments an d 
resources can best help children meet with economic success after they reach adulthood .  
There has  been a lot of discussion in the aftermath of the Great Recession about  how to 
best connect people with s teady  jobs.   But research presented over the next t wo days 
makes a compelling case that there is a need to also think longer term about how to 
prepare people for success in the labor market.  In fact, this research underscores the 
value of starting young to develop basic work habits and skills, like litera cy, numeracy, 
and interpersonal and organizational skills.  These habits and skills help prepare people 
for work, help them enter the labor market sooner, meet with more success over time, and 
be in a position to develop the more specialized skills and obt ain the academic credentials 
that are strongly correlated with higher and steadier earnings.  Indeed,  a growing body of 
economic and education literatur e has focused on the relative efficiency of addressing 
workforce development challenges through investme nts in early childhood development 
and education  compared with interventions later in life . 
I believe that data, evidence, and research can help policymakers and practitioners 
think more clearly about the implications for improving economic and life outcom es for 
everyone.   To this end, the speakers at this conference will focus on three broad issues .  I 
                                                 
2 See note 1.   - 4 - 
woul d like to briefly mention each, highlighting some of the questions that I believe can 
be informed by the research t hat will  be presented here.   
First, this morning’s panel will address early childhood development and 
education.  In recent years, medicine and social science has revealed more than we ever 
have known before about which factors and experiences in childhood can make a 
difference later in life .  However, many questions demand further attention.  A 
fundamental one is how positive developmental outcomes can be promoted among  those 
who were not born into families with socioeconomic advantages.  While we do know 
there are advantages to good quality  early childhood education, we should strive to better 
understand what kind of returns on investment this education provides and how to 
maximize these returns.  The answers to these questions may influence thinking about 
how programs and interventions mean t to assist kids and their families should be 
structured for maximum effectiveness to help put kids on the road to economic success.  
Second, researchers have explored the effects of neighborhoods and community 
conditions on the development of young people.   Some presenters at this conference will 
share their understanding of how physical surroundings influence personal development.  
For instance, how do the form and quality of community institutions such as schools, 
community centers, and libraries play a r ole?  What other kinds of community 
characteristics --such as public safety, transportation, and environmental quality --might 
help or hinder general education and financial skill development?  A particularly 
important question is how kids’ home environments  affect them in ways that matter for 
their future economic success.  It is also critically important to ask, what kinds of 
interventions have proven track records, and are these programs scalable?   - 5 - 
Third , and f inally, other presenters will explore issues around skill development 
of youths and young adults, workforce outcomes, and the implications for the broader 
economy.  They will ask how we understand which formative experiences most affect the 
ability of youn g people to successfully move to the next chapter in their lives, whether 
that means college, a job, or other paths such as self -employment.  What role does a 
range of programs --starting with early childhood education all the way through youth 
vocational o r apprenticeship training --play in affecting job readiness?  How effective are 
different approaches , and what are the returns on investment?  We should also pay 
attention to how well young people form the sorts of “soft skills” --things like teamwork, 
commu nication, and the ability to handle conflict --that are so valued by employers.  And, 
for young people whose paths become difficult, such as those who get caught up in the 
juvenile justice system, what effect do such experiences have on their futures as wor kers 
and consumers , and what are the most promising approaches to foster a course 
correction?   
I hope that the data and other evidence presented today and tomorrow are of use 
to you in your work.  Community development professionals attending this confere nce 
may consider how the design and implementation of their programs may be improved.  
Policymakers may look more closely at how kids  are affected --purposefully or 
unintentionally --by public policies.  And researchers may encounter ideas that spark new 
work that can shed further light on these important topics.  
I think i t is important that we better understand these i ssues, and I applaud you for 
taking  the time to be here to share your knowledge and to learn .  Our young people are 
the future , and we all want them to have the support they need for successful and  - 6 - 
fulfilling lives.  As a central banker, I recognize the benefits to the broader economy 
when more people are better prepared for work and for managing their finances.  In short, 
ensurin g that all of our kids have “ strong foundations ” will help build a similarly strong 
foundation for the U.S. economy.  ",2017-03-23,yellen

Stress Testing Banks:  What Have We Learned?

a Financial Markets Conference

April 8, 2013  Let me begin by thanking President Lockhart and the organizers of the Financial 
Markets Conference for inviting me to speak here again this year.  I have participated 
regularly in this conference and have always found it stimulating.  
Four yea rs ago, in remarks  at this very conference, I described the 2009 
Supervisory Capital Assessment Program , or SCAP , popularly known as the bank stress 
tests.1  The SCAP marked  the first time the U.S. bank regulatory agencies  had conduct ed 
a supervisory stress test simultaneously across the largest banking firms.2  At the time of 
my 2009 speech , we had just published the results of the SCAP  and were still evaluating 
its effects .  In retrospect, the SCAP stands out for me as one of the critical turning points 
in the financial  crisis .  It provided anxious  investors with something they craved:  
credible information about prospective losses at banks.  Supervisors’  public disclosure of 
the stress test results helped restore confidence  in the banking system a nd enabled its 
successful recapitalization.  The resilience of the U.S. banking system has greatly 
improved since the n, and the more intensive  use and greater sophistication of supervisory 
stress testing , as well as supervisors’ increased emphasis on  the effectiveness of  banks’ 
own capital planning processes,  deserve  some  credit for that improvement .  
 I will  begin today with a brief discussion of the state of U.S. banking.  I will then  
turn to the subject of  what we have learned about stress testing in the four years since the 
SCAP , with a focus on the increasingly central role it is playing in bank supervision  in 
the United States .  Importantly, as I will elaborate, stress testi ng adds a macroprudential

dimension  to our supervision by helping us evaluate the aggregate capital position of the 
largest banking firms as well as their individual capital levels.  
 The Federal Reserve --like all bureaucracies --has an unfortunate tendency to 
create acronyms, so , before I proceed further, let me explain our acronyms, in addition to 
SCAP , for stress tests .  With the SCAP now in the past, we currently  have two distinct 
but related supervisory programs  that rely on stress testing .  The first is the stress testing 
required by the Dodd -Frank Act, which we have shortened to the acronym DFAST --the 
Dodd -Frank Act stress tests.  The purpose of DFAST is to quantitative ly assess  how bank 
capital levels would fare in stress ful economic and financial  scenarios.  The second 
program, called the Comprehensive  Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR, combines 
the quantitative results from the stress tests with more -qualitative  assessment s of the 
capital planning processes used by banks .  For example, under CCAR, supervisors 
evaluate the ability of banks to model l osses  for various categories of loans and securities  
and to estimate earnings and capital requirements  in alternative  scenarios.   We recently 
completed the first set of DFAST stress tests and disclosed the results , followed a week 
later by the disclosure of our CCAR findings, which included our qualitative assessments 
of firms’ capital planning.3  
The State of the Banking System, Then and Now  
 To provide context for the developments in the banking system since the 
introduction of the SCAP in early 2009, i t’s worth briefly recalling the economic

Results of Bank Stress Tests,” press release, March 7,

situation that prevailed at that time.   The economy was in deep recession, with the 
unemployment rate having risen  4 percentage points,  from 5 percent to 9 percent , over 
the preceding 12 months.  The prices of real estate and equities had plummeted, interest  
rate spreads --such as the spread between rates on mortgages and Treasury securities --had 
widened to unprecedented levels, and securitization markets had frozen.  Write -downs 
and losse s continued to deplete banks’ capital, unnerving  investor s and counterparties and 
exacerbating the severe funding pressures fac ed by  many institutions.   In the face of this 
instability, in 2008 and 2009 policymakers had taken  a range of extraordinary measures :  
The Federal Reserve  supplied liquidity to banks and other financial institu tions, helping 
to calm the panic and begin the process of restor ing the flow of credit  to households and 
businesses ; the Treasury Department guarantee d money market funds  and inject ed capital 
into banks under the T roubled Asset Relief  Program ; the Congress expanded deposit 
insurance under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  (FDIC) ; and the FDIC 
guarantee d banks’ issuance of long -term debt.  A nd, a s I noted, the SCAP helped to 
increase confidence in the banking system  and restore banks’ access to private capital 
markets .  Ten of the 19 large bank holding companies that underwent the SCAP  were 
required to raise equity capital --by $75 billion in total. 
 Today  the economy is  significantly stronger than it was  four years ago , although  
conditions are clearly still far from where we would all like them to be.   Because bank  
credit for households and businesses is critical to continued economic expansion, it is  
positive  for the recovery that banks are  also notably  stronger than they were a few years 
ago.  For example, premiums on bank  credit default swap s have fallen by more than half 
of their 2009 levels , and other measures of bank risk have also declined substantially.  - 4 - 
 
More than 90 percent of t he public capital injections that were used to stabilize the 
banking system have been repaid , and the Federal Reserve’s extraordinary liquidity 
programs and the FDIC’s temporary guarantees for uninsured business deposits and bond 
issues have largely been wound down .  
 The results of the most recent  stress tests and capital planning evaluations  
continu e to reflect improvement in bank s’ condition .  For example, p rojected aggregate 
loan losses  under this year’s  most stres sful scenario (the so-called severely adverse 
scenario) were 7 percent lower than the comparable figure last year, in part because  the 
riskiness of banks’ portfolios  continues to decline .  The comparison of today’s bank 
capital levels with  those at the time of the SCAP is particularly striking.   Over the past 
four years, the  aggregate tier 1 common equity ratio of the  18 firms that underwent the 
recent tests  has more than doubled , from 5.6 percent  of risk -weighted assets  at the end of 
2008 to 11.3 percent at the end of 2012 --in absolute terms, a  net gain of  nearly $400  
billion in tier 1 common equity , to almost $800  billion at the end of 2012.   Indeed, e ven 
under the severely adverse scenario of the la test stress test, the estimate of the se firms’ 
post-stress tier 1 common capital ratio is more than 2 percentage points higher than 
actual  capital levels at the end of 2008 .4  Higher capital puts these firms in a much better 
position to absorb future losses while continuing  to fulfill their vital role in the economy.   
In addition, a  majority of the 18 CCAR firms  already meet new internationally agreed -
upon capital standards ( the proposed B asel III capital requirements ), and the others are on 
track to meet these requirements as they are phased in over time . 
                                                           
4 On an individual firm basis and taking into consideration planned capital actions --that is, capital r aises or 
distributions --all but 1 of the 18 firms evaluated this year had post -stress capital ratios above the regulatory 
minimum.  - 5 - 
 
 Although the stress tests focus on the largest banks, the medium -sized and smaller 
banks outside of the 18 CCAR firms have also improved their aggregate capital position 
considerably  since the SCAP .  For that group of banks , aggregate tier 1 common  equity 
stood at 12.4 percent of risk -weighted assets in the fourth quarter of 2012, more than 4 
percentage points higher than at the end of 2008.   
 Another key lesson of the crisis , given the intense funding p ressures experienced 
by many financial institutions during the period,  is the importance of maintaining 
adequate liquidity --that is, a stock of cash and unencumbered high -quality liquid assets 
that can be converted easily into cash .  Here too, the news is mostly positive, as the 
broader banking system --including both large r and small er banks --has generally  
improved its liquidity position relative to pre-crisis levels .  For example, banks’ holdings 
of cash and high -quality liquid securities have more than do ubled since the end of 200 7 
and now total more than $2.5 trillion .  However, in the area of liquidity and funding, 
continued improvement is still needed  on some dimensions.  Notably, supervisors will 
continue to press banks  to reduce  further  their dependence on wholesale funding, which 
proved highly unreliable during  the crisis.  A nd, in analogy to the need for effective 
capital planning, banks of all sizes need to further strengthen their ability to identify, 
quantify, and manage their liqui dity risks.   
The Evolution of Stress Testing  
 Let me turn now to the evolution of stress testing  as a supervisory tool .  The main  
benefits  of stress test s for supervision  have not changed  much  since the SCAP was 
conducted in 2009.  First, stress tests complement standard capital ratios by adding a 
more forward -looking perspective an d by being  more oriented toward protection against - 6 - 
 
so-called tail risks ; by design, stress tests  help ensur e that banks will have enough capital 
to keep lending  even under hi ghly adverse circumstances .  Second, as applied by the 
Federal Reserve, the  stress tests look horizontally across banks rather than at a single 
bank  in isolation .  This comparative approach promotes more -consistent supervisory 
standards .  It also provides valuable systemic information by revealing how significant 
economic or financial shocks would affect the largest banks collectively  as well as 
individually .  Third, the disclosures of stress test results promote transparency by 
providin g the public  consistent and comparable information about banks’ financial 
conditions .   
 The basic methodology  of our stress testing has also not changed  materially since 
the SCAP .  We continue to take a multidisciplinary approach, draw ing on a wide  range of 
staff expertise.  To begin the process , our economists create a hypothetical 
macroeconomic scenario that incorporates an assumed sharp deterioration in economic 
and financial conditions .  Supervisors estimate each bank’s expected losses and reven ues 
and we  use these estimates to project post-stress capital  levels and ratios  under that 
hypothetical scenario .  The estimated capital ratios are then compared with regulatory 
benchmark s. We use  a common  scenario for all firms; for the firms with the largest 
trading activities, we supplement the basic scenario with a market -shock scenario that 
incorporates market turbulence of severity similar to that of the latter half of 2008.     
 Although the basic  goals and  approach of stress testing have  remained largely 
unchanged since the SCAP, the implementation has evolved and improved  from year to 
year.  For example,  we have  continued to refine the formulation of the hypothetical 
scenarios that form the basis of the stress tests .  As explained in a statement we released - 7 - 
 
in the fall, the severely adverse scenario is designed to reflect, at a minimum, the  
economic and financial  conditions typical of a severe post -World W ar II U.S. recession.5  
In devising recession scenarios, we draw on many of the same macroeconomic modeling 
tools used in making  monetary policy.   Of course , not all significant risks facing banks  
are tied to the business cycle .  Accordingly , our scenarios  now generally  incorporate not 
only the  typical  consequences of  a severe recession but  also, simultaneously, other 
adverse  developments  such as an exceptionally large decline in house prices, sharp drops 
in the value of stocks and other financial assets, or a worsening of global  economic 
conditions more severe than  might normally be expected to accompany a deep  recession 
in the United States.    
 Importantly, in  specifying the severely adverse  scenario , we seek to avoid adding 
to the procyclicality of the financial system .  In other words, in applying stress tests, we 
do not want to inadvertently set a standard that is easier to meet in good times (when 
banks should be preparing for possibly tougher times ahead)  than in bad times (when 
banks need to be able to use accumula ted capital to support lending).  Accordingly, we 
will want  to ensure that the stress scenario remains severe in an absolute sense even when 
the economy is strong and the near -term risks to the outlook seem relatively modest.  
 We have also improved  our tools for estimating  projected bank  losses , revenues, 
and capital under alternative scenarios .  The original SCAP was supervisors ’ first attempt  
to produce comprehensive and simultaneous estimates of the financial conditions of  the 
nation’ s largest banking firms, and the required data and analytical methods  were 
                                                           
5 See the proposed “Policy Statement on the Scenario Design Framework for Stress  Testing ” of the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  (Nov. 15, 2012), available at 
www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/bcreg20121115a4.pdf.  - 8 - 
 
developed  under great time pressure.  Of necessity, when projecting losses and revenues 
under alternative  SCAP scenarios, supervisors  relied on the firms’ own estimates  as a 
starting point .  Although  we scrutinized and questioned the  firms’ estimates and made 
significant adjustments based on our own  analysis, for that inaugural round of stress tests , 
it was not possible to  produce  completely independent estimates.   
 How ever, over the past four years, considerable progress has been made in data 
collection and in the development of  independent supervisory models .  For our most 
recent supervisory stress tests , we collected and analyzed loan- and account -level data on 
more than two -thirds of the $4.2 trillion in accrual loans and lease s projected to be held 
by the 18 firms  we evaluated this year .  Those detailed data include borrower, loan, and 
collateral information on more than  350 million domestic retail loans, inclu ding credit 
cards and mortgages, and more than 200,000  commercial loans.   Currently, the Federal 
Reserve uses more than 40 models  to project how categories of bank losses and revenues 
would likely respond in hypothetical scenarios.   The improvements in data and models 
have increased our  ability to distinguish risks within portfolios.  Importantly , these 
supervisory models are evaluated by a special model validation group  made up of experts  
within the Federal Reserve  who do not work on t he stress tests .  We have also created  a 
Model Validation Council made up of external experts to provide independent views and 
advice .6  These ongoing efforts are bringing us  close to the point at which we will be able

to estimate, in a fully independent way , how each firm’s loss, revenue, and capital ratio 
would likely respond in any specified  scenario.   
 Another innovation since the SCAP is the  increased supervisory focus on banks’ 
internal capital planning  practices , which are reviewed  as part of CCAR .  We see the 
requirement that banks with assets of $50 billion or more submit annual capital plans to 
the Federal Reserve as a critical enhancement.7  While regulatory minimums and 
supervisory expectations provide floors for acceptable capital levels, the firms and their 
boards of directors are responsible for  assessing their own capital needs  over and above 
the minimums .  Our supervisors scrutinize th eir practices and assess their capacity to 
fulfill that responsibility.   In particular, we  require firms to formulate their own scenario s 
that capture the risks that they face , and to assess  potential losses and revenues under 
both the supervisory scenario s and their internal scenario s over a nine -quarter horizon.  In 
CCAR, our qualitative assessment of a firm’s capital planning is integrated with the 
quantitative results of both  the supervisory and company -run stress tests.   
 The Federal Reserve continues to increase  the transparency of our stress testing 
process, the results of the exercises, and our assessments of banks’ capital planning.  The 
original SCAP set a new standar d of supervisory transparency in  disclosing bank -by-bank 
estimates of stress losses by type of exposure.  This departure from the traditionally  
confidential treatment of supervisory information, as I noted earlier, was intended to 
restore public confidence by providing much -needed information about banks’ potential 
                                                           
7 A capital plan describes a firm’s capital planning strategies and its processes for measuring potential 
capital needs both under expected and stressed operating environments and for ensuring that it is holding 
adequate capital to be able to continue to function even under stress.  See Board of Governors of the 
Federal Reserve System (2011), “Capita l Plans,” final rule  (Docket No.  R-1425) , Federal Register , vol. 76 
(December 1), pp. 74631 -48, www.federalregister.gov/articles/2011/12/01/2011 -30665/capital -plans . - 10 - 
 
losses and capital needs .  In last month’s results, in addition to projected losses and 
revenues, we disclosed for the first time whether we had objected to each firm’s capital 
plan.8  Also for the first time, banks were required to disclose their  own estimates of 
stressed losses and revenues.  The disclosures by banks give investors and analysts an 
alternative perspective on the test results; they also help them form judgments about 
banks’ appetites for risk and their risk -management practices, pa rticularly their abilities 
to measure losses in a severe downturn.  E ven outside of a period of crisis, the disclosure  
of stress test results and assessments provides valuable information to market participants 
and the public , enhances transparency, and pr omotes market discipline.  
 In the four years since the SCAP, t he Federal Reserve’s stress testing program has 
been expanded and strengthened through both statut e and regulation .  The Dodd -Frank 
Act widened  the scope of stress test ing to all bank holding co mpanies with $50  billion or 
more in total consolidated assets (approximately 11 companies in addition to the original 
SCAP participants) and to nonbank financial companies designated by the F inancial 
Stability Oversight Council  as systemically impo rtant, and therefore subject to  
consolidated supervision  by the Federal Reserve .  Dodd -Frank also requires these 
companies to conduct their own stress tests twice a year .  In October, t he Federal Reserve 
Board adopted rules implementing these requirements.9  The 11 additional companies 
with assets of $50 billion or more will be subject to DFAST and CCAR for the first time 
next year.

 While no institutions below $50 billion in assets are subject to supervisory stress 
testing  or the requirements of CCAR , the Dodd -Frank Act does require that institutions 
with between $10 billion and $50 billion in assets conduct their own stress test s.10  The 
initial tests by these firms will begin this year and will be completed by March.   While 
we believe  that stress testi ng will help medium -sized institutions better understand the 
risks they face, we tailored our rule for these institutions to take account of differences in 
size, complexity, and business model s.  We specifically exempted community banking 
organizations wit h $10 billion or less in total assets from the requirement  that they  run 
their own stress tests  as those institutions cannot reasonably be expected to have the 
resources that larger banks devote to stress test ing.11  
Benefits and Challenges of Stress Testing  
 As already noted, s tress testing has a number of important benefits as a 
supervisory tool.  From a microprudential perspective, t he CCAR provides a structured 
means for supervisors to assess  not only whether banks hold enough capital, but also 
whether banks  are able to rapidly and accurately determine their risk exposures, an 
essential element of effective risk management.   The cross -firm nature of the stress tests 
also helps supervisors iden tify outliers --both in terms of results and practices --that can 
provide a basis for further, more  targeted review s.

www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20120514b.htm . - 12 - 
 
 From a macroprudential perspective, the use of a common scenario allow s us to 
learn how a particular risk or combination of risks might affect the banking system as a 
whole --not just individual institutions.   This experience with stress testing has  indeed 
been very useful for our efforts to better monitor and evaluate  potenti al systemic risk s.  
For example, in our macroprudential work, as in our stress tests, we tend to rely  on 
horizontal examinations and comparative studies, as opposed to firm -by-firm 
assessments ; we use multidisciplinary, specialized teams to supplement the work of on -
site examiners ; and we have increase d our use of modeling and quantitative methods , 
using data drawn from different institutions and time periods .  All of these features are 
apparent in the workings of  our Large Institution Supervision Coordinating Committee, 
which provides coordinated oversight of the  supervision of systemically important firms.   
We have also extended the lessons of systemwide stress testing to analysis  of factors 
other than capital :  For example, we  recently completed a horizontal review of liquidity 
positions and liquidity risk -management practices  at some of the largest CCAR firms .  
Like the CCAR  review of capital planning , this review was a multidisciplinary effort that 
used quantitative  information --in this case, detailed data on firms’ liquidity positions --as 
well as qualitative information on liquidity risk -management practices.  
Notwithstanding the demonstrated benefits of comprehensive stress testing, th is 
evolving tool also present s challenges.  For example, even as we  continue to explore 
ways to enhance the transparency  of the models  we use to estimate  banks’ projected 
revenues and losses, we have chosen not to publish the full specification of these mode ls.  
As a result, we hear criticism  from bank ers that our models are a “black box ,” which 
frustrates the ir efforts to anticipate our supervisory findings.  We agree that banks should - 13 - 
 
understand in general terms how the supervisory models work , and, even mo re 
important ly, they need to be confident that  our models are empirically validated and 
sound.  I mentioned our internal effort s at model validation, which have  increase d the 
quality and accuracy of our models.  We have also begun  to host a n annual stress test 
modeling symposium , which provides a venue for regulators, bankers, academics, and 
others to share their views.  Over time, we expect banks to better understand the basic 
elements of the supervisory models, re ndering them at least somewhat less opaque .  
At the same time , it is reasonable to worry that , with increased disclosure of 
supervisory  models, firms would see a declining  benefit to maintaining independent risk -
management systems and would just adopt supervisory models  instead .  Doing so would 
certainly make it easier to “pass” the stress tests .  However, a ll models have their blind 
spots, and such an outcome risks a “model monoculture” that  would be susceptible  to a 
single, common failure.   The differences in stress test result s obtained by supervisors’ 
and banks’ own models  can be informative , and we do not want inadvertently to destroy 
the healthy diversity or innovation of the models  and other risk -management tools  used in 
the banking industry.  
Another challenge is that our stress scenarios cannot encompass all of the risks 
that banks might face.  For example, although some operational  risk losses , such as 
expenses for mortgage put -backs , are incorporated  in our stress test estimates, banks may 
face operational, legal, and other risks that are specific to their company or are otherwise 
difficult to estimate.   It is important for banking firms  to consider the potential for losses 
from these other  classes of  risks  as systematically as possible , and supervisors also - 14 - 
 
account  for these risks as best they can .  Of course, unforeseen events are inevitable, 
which is why maintaining a healthy level of capital is essential . 
Conclusion   
As I have  discussed today , the banking system is much stronger since the 
implementation of the SCAP four years ago , which in turn has contributed  to the 
improvement in the overall economy.   The use of supervisory stress tests --a practice now 
codified in statute --has helped foster  these gains.  Methodologically, stress tests  are 
forward looking and focus on  unlikely  but plausible  risks , as opposed to “normal” risks .  
Consequently, they complement more conventional capital and leverage ratios.  The 
disclosure of the results of supervisory stress t ests, coupled with firms’ disclosure s of 
their own stress test results, provide market  participants deeper insight not only into the 
financial strength of each bank but also into the quality of its risk management and 
capital planning.  Stress testing is a lso proving highly complementary to supervisors’ 
monitoring and analysis of potential systemic risks.   We will continue to make 
refinements to our implementation of stress testing and our CCAR process as we learn 
from experience.   
 As I have noted, o ne of  the most important aspects  of regular stress testing is tha t 
it forces banks (and their supervisors) to develop the capacity to  quickly and accurately  
assess the enterprise -wide exposure s of their institutions to diverse  risks, and to use that  
information  routinely to  help ensure that they maintain adequate capital and liquidity.   
The development and ongoing refinement of that risk-management capacity is itself 
critical  for protecting individual banks and the banking system , upon which the health of 
our ec onomy depends . ",2013-04-08,bernanke

Fiscal Sustainability 
   
Remarks by 
 
Ben S. Bernanke 
 
Chairman 
 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
 
at the 
 
Annual Conference of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget 
 
Washington, D.C. 
       
June 14, 2011 
  
I am pleased to speak to a group that has such a distinguished record of 
identifying crucial issues related to the federal budget and working toward bipartisan solutions to our nation’s fiscal problems.  Today I will briefly discuss the fiscal 
challenges the nation faces and the importan ce of meeting those challenges for our 
collective economic future.  I will then conc lude with some thoughts on the way forward. 
Fiscal Policy Challenges 
At about 9 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), the federal budget deficit 
has widened appreciably since the onset of  the recent recession in December 2007.  The 
exceptional increase in the deficit has mostly reflected the automatic cyclical response of 
revenues and spending to a weak economy as we ll as the fiscal actions  taken to ease the 
recession and aid the recovery.  As the economy continues to expand and stimulus 
policies are phased out, the budget deficit shou ld narrow over the next few years.   
Unfortunately, even after economic conditions have returned to normal, the nation 
faces a sizable structural budget gap.  Both  the Congressional Budget Office and the 
Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget project that the budge t deficit will be 
almost 5 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2015, assuming that current budget policies are 
extended and the economy is then close to full employment.
1  Of even greater concern is 
that longer-run projections that extrapolate current pol icies and make plausible 
assumptions about the future evolution of the economy show the structural budget gap 
increasing significantly further over time.  For example, under the alternative fiscal 
scenario developed by the Congressional B udget Office, which assumes most current 
policies are extended, the defic it is projected to be about 6-1/2 percent of GDP in 2020 
and almost 13 percent of GDP in 2030.  The ratio of outstanding federal debt to GDP, 
                                                 
1 See Congressional Budget Office (2010) and Commi ttee for a Responsible Federal Budget (2010).  - 2 -
expected to be about 69 percen t at the end of this fiscal year, would under that scenario 
rise to 87 percent in 202 0 and 146 percent in 2030.2  One reason the debt is projected to 
increase so quickly is that the larger the debt outstanding, the greater the budgetary cost 
of making the required interest payments.  This dynamic is clearly unsustainable. 
The nation’s long-term fiscal imbalan ces did not emerge overnight.  To a 
significant extent, they are th e result of an aging population and fast-rising health-care 
costs, both of which have been predicted fo r decades.  The Congressional Budget Office 
projects that net fede ral outlays for health-care entitle ments--which were 5 percent of 
GDP in 2010--could rise to more than 8 pe rcent of GDP by 2030.  Even though projected 
fiscal imbalances associated with the Social  Security system are smaller than those for 
federal health programs, they are still signi ficant.  Although we have been warned about 
such developments for many years, the diffe rence is that today those projections are 
becoming reality. 
A large and increasing level of government debt relative to national income risks 
serious economic consequences.  Over the l onger term, rising federa l debt crowds out 
private capital formation and thus reduces productivity growth.  To the extent that 
increasing debt is financed by borrowing from  abroad, a growing share of our future 
income would be devoted to interest payments  on foreign-held federal debt.  High levels 
of debt also impair the ability of policymak ers to respond effectively to future economic 
shocks and other adverse events.   
Even the prospect of unsustainable defi cits has costs, including an increased 
possibility of a sudden fiscal crisis.  As we have seen in a number of countries recently, 
                                                 
2 The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (2010) projects federal debt to be 89 percent of GDP in 
2020 and 127 percent of GDP in 2030.  - 3 -
interest rates can soar quickl y if investors lose confidence in the ability of a government 
to manage its fiscal policy.  Although histor ical experience and ec onomic theory do not 
show the exact threshold at which the perceive d risks associated with the U.S. public debt 
would increase markedly, we can be sure that, without correctiv e action, our fiscal 
trajectory is moving the nation ever closer to  that point. 
Perhaps the most important thing for people to understand about the federal 
budget is that maintaining the status quo is not  an option.  Creditors  will not lend to a 
government whose debt, relative to national income, is rising without limit; so, one way 
or the other, fiscal adjustments sufficient to stabilize the federa l budget must occur at 
some point.  These adjustments could ta ke place through a careful and deliberative 
process that weighs priorities and gives individuals and firms adequate time to adjust to 
changes in government programs and tax polic ies.  Or the needed fiscal adjustments 
could come as a rapid and much more painful re sponse to a looming or actual fiscal crisis 
in an environment of rising in terest rates, collapsing conf idence and asset values, and a 
slowing economy.  The choice is ours to make. 
Achieving Fiscal Sustainability 
The primary long-term goal for federal budget policy must be achieving fiscal 
sustainability.  A straightforward way to define fiscal sustainability is as a situation in 
which the ratio of federal debt to nationa l income is stable or moving down over the 
longer term.  This goal can be attained  by bringing spendi ng, excluding interest 
payments, roughly in line with revenues, or in other words, by approximately balancing 
the primary budget.  Given the sharp run-up in debt over the past few years, it would be  - 4 -
reasonable to plan for a period of prim ary budget surpluses, which would serve 
eventually to bring the ratio of debt to nati onal income back toward  pre-recession levels.  
Fiscal sustainability is a long-run concept.  Achiev ing fiscal sustainability, 
therefore, requires a long-run pl an, one that reduces deficits  over an extended period and 
that, to the fullest extent possible, is cred ible, practical, and enforceable.  In current 
circumstances, an advantage of taking a l onger-term perspective in forming concrete 
plans for fiscal consolidation is that policymakers can avoi d a sudden fiscal contraction 
that might put the still-fragile recovery at ri sk.  At the same time, acting now to put in 
place a credible plan for reducing future deficits would not only enhance economic 
performance in the long run, but could also yi eld near-term benefits by leading to lower 
long-term interest rates and increase d consumer and business confidence. 
While it is crucial to have a federal budget that is sustainable, our fiscal policies 
should also reflect the nation’s priorities  by providing the conditions to support ongoing 
gains in living standards and by st riving to be fair both to curr ent and future generations.  
In addressing our long-term fiscal challe nges, we should reform the government’s tax 
policies and spending priorities so that they not only reduce the defi cit, but also enhance 
the long-term growth potential of our economy --for example, by increasing incentives to 
work and to save, by encouraging investme nt in the skills of our workforce, by 
stimulating private capital formation, by prom oting research and development, and by 
providing necessary public infrastructure.  We cannot reasonably expect to grow our way 
out of our fiscal imbalances, but a more pr oductive economy will ease the tradeoffs that 
we face.    - 5 -
Making Fiscal Plans 
It is easy to call for sustainable fiscal po licies but much harder  to deliver them.  
The issues are not simply technical; they are al so closely tied to our values and priorities 
as a nation.  It is little wonder that the de bates have been so intense and progress so 
difficult to achieve. 
Recently, negotiations over our long-run fi scal policies have become tied to the 
issue of raising the statutory limit for federal de bt.  I fully understand the desire to use the 
debt limit deadline to force some necessary a nd difficult fiscal policy adjustments, but the 
debt limit is the wrong tool for that important  job.  Failing to raise the debt ceiling in a 
timely way would be self-defeating if the objec tive is to chart a course toward a better 
fiscal situation for our nation. 
The current level of the debt and nea r-term borrowing needs reflect spending and 
revenue choices that have already been a pproved by the current and previous Congresses 
and Administrations of both poli tical parties.  Failing to raise the debt limit would require 
the federal government to delay or renege on payments for obligations already entered 
into.  In particular, even a short suspension of payments on principal or interest on the 
Treasury’s debt obligations could cause severe  disruptions in financial markets and the 
payments system, induce ratings downgrades of U.S. government debt, create fundamental doubts about the creditworthiness of the United States, and damage the special role of the dollar and Treasury securi ties in global markets in the longer term.  
Interest rates would likely rise, slowing th e recovery and, perver sely, worsening the  - 6 -
deficit problem by increasing required interest  payments on the debt for what might well 
be a protracted period.3 
Some have suggested that payments by the Treasury could be prioritized to meet 
principal and interest payments on debt out standing, thus avoiding a technical default on 
federal debt.  However, even if that were the case, given the current si ze of the deficit and 
the uneven time pattern of government receip ts and payments, the Treasury would soon 
find it necessary to prioritize among and withhold critical dis bursements, such as Social 
Security and Medicare payments and funds  for the military.  Moreover, while debt-
related payments might be met in this s cenario, the fact that many other government 
payments would be delayed could still creat e serious concerns about the safety of 
Treasury securities among financial market part icipants.  The Hippocratic oath holds that, 
first, we should do no harm.  In debati ng critical fiscal issues, we should avoid 
unnecessary actions or threats that risk shaki ng the confidence of investors in the ability 
and willingness of the U.S. government to pay its bills. 
In raising this concern, I am by no m eans recommending delay or inaction in 
addressing the nation’s long-term fiscal ch allenges--quite the opposite.  I urge the 
Congress and the Administration to work in good faith to quickly develop and implement 
a credible plan to achieve long-term sustai nability.  I hope, though, that such a plan can 
be achieved in the near term without resor ting to brinksmanship or  actions that would 
cast doubt on the creditworthi ness of the United States. 
What would such a plan look like?  Clear  metrics are important, together with 
triggers or other mechanisms to establish the credibility of the plan.  For example, 
                                                 
3 Some evidence that interest rates can rise in respon se to even a short, temporary period during which the 
Treasury cannot make payments on a relatively small am ount of maturing securities is presented by Zivney 
and Marcus (1989).  - 7 -
policymakers could commit to enacting in the near term a clear and specific plan for 
stabilizing the ratio of debt to GDP within  the next few years and then subsequently 
setting that ratio on a downward path.  Indeed, such a trajectory for the ratio of debt to 
GDP is comparable to the one proposed  by the National Commission on Fiscal 
Responsibility and Reform.4  To make the framework more  explicit, the President and 
congressional leadership could agree on a defi nite timetable for reaching decisions about 
both shorter-term budget adjustments and longe r-term changes.  Fiscal policymakers 
could look now to find substantial savings in the 10-year budget window, enforced by 
well-designed budget rules, while simultane ously undertaking additional reforms to 
address the long-term sustainability of en titlement programs.  Such a framework could 
include a commitment to make a down paym ent on fiscal consolidation by enacting 
legislation to reduce the st ructural deficit over the next several years.   
Conclusion 
The task of developing and implementing sustainable fiscal policies is daunting, 
and it will involve many agonizing decisions an d difficult tradeoffs.  But meeting this 
challenge in a timely manner is crucial for our nation.  History makes clear that failure to 
put our fiscal house in order will erode the vitality of our econom y, reduce the standard 
of living in the United States, and increase the risk of economic and fi nancial instability.

Improving the Oversight of Large Financial Institutions

Citizens Budget Commission

Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today , it is great to be back in New 
York.  The Citizens Budget Commission has played an important role over the years as a 
forum to discuss issues of interest to New Yorkers that are often also of national and even global importance.  Given New York’s preeminence as a center of global finance, I thought it would be appropriate to discuss just such a topic, which is how the Federal Reserve oversees the largest financial institutions, many of which are headquartered or have a major presence here, and how that oversight has strengthened since the financial crisis.
1   
The Financial Crisis and Large Financ ial Institutions  
The crisis had many causes , including  the numerous factors that drove a lengthy 
housing boom and the expansion of a  largely unr egulated “shadow banking system ” 
rivaling the traditional banking sector in size.  A self -reinforcing financial panic 
magnified the damage from risks that had built up over many years throughout the country and across the financial system.   
But t o a considerable extent, large and complex financial institutions were the 
epicenter of the crisis.  These institutions, some of which were not subject to Federal Reserve oversight at the time, were the locus for much of the excessive risk -taking that 
led to the crisis.  Due to their primacy and interconnections with the rest of the financial system, these large institutions were also the means by which the crisis spread quickly and with devastating effect through the economy.   
1 Although the Federal Reserve supervises entities with a range of legal forms, including depository 
institutions and holding companies, for the purposes of my remarks today, “financial institutions,” “firms,” 
“banks,” and “banking organizations” are used i nterchangeably unless indicated otherwise.                                                    - 2 - 
The financial crisis and the recession caused great hardship for millions of 
individuals and families in this city and in communities throughout our country.  I believe 
all Americans share a common interest in working  to make sure that our financial system 
is strong , resilient, and a ble to serve a healthy and growing economy.  A critical part of 
our work since the crisis to promote a stable financial system has therefore involved greater effort to ensure that large institutions are operating safely and soundly and are prepared to cont inue serving households and businesses even when faced with stressful 
financial conditions. 
In the run- up to the crisis, large firms failed to adequately  anticipate and manage 
risks that grew and concentrated in their increasingly sprawling, diverse, and c omplex 
operations.  Partly as a result, these firms had trouble retaining the trust of markets and creditors when the financial system came under stress.  Doubts quickly mounted about whether these institutions could sustain losses in the value of many ass ets they held.  
Further doubts were raised about whether these firms had enough cash and other liquid assets to meet the immediate or potential demands of short- term creditors and large 
institutional customers.  In the lead -up to the crisis, many large ins titutions had become 
heavily reliant on very short -term borrowing, at relatively low rates, to fund lending and 
other operations providing higher returns.  While this approach may have appeared to be an easy source of profit, it had the disadvantage of lea ving those banks exposed to 
devastating runs if short -term funding dried up, as it did in the crisis.   
Large financial institutions, of course, were not alone in failing to see these risks.  
The checks and balances that were widely expected to prevent excessive risk -taking by 
large financial firms --regulatory oversight and market  discipline --did not do so.   - 3 - 
Government agencies, including the Fed, failed to recognize the extent of the risks or 
how severely they could damage the financial system and the econ omy.  Investors failed 
to anticipate and understand the risks of large financial institutions’ activities that materialized during the crisis.   
Background on Financial  Regulation and Supervision 
Before I turn to the Fed’s actions to improve oversight of l arge financial 
institutions, let me be clear about what I mean  by “large institutions. ”  Generally, I have 
in mind those firms whose financial distress would pose a significant risk to financial 
stability --firms that are, in that sense, “systemically impor tant.”  This would include U.S. 
banking organizations with large, complex, and often international operations; foreign banking organizations with extensive U.S. operations; and other large and complex financial firms.  Today the Federal Reserve subjects 16  of th ose firms to significantly 
higher levels of oversight than are applied to other institutions.
2  To put the scale and 
importance of these firms in perspective, the 8 U.S. bank holding companies among these 16 firms hold nearly 60 percent of all assets  in the U.S. banking system.
3   
The Federal Reserve’s oversight of large financial institutions is aimed at 
ensuring the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions as well as the resiliency of the financial system.  The Fed expects the banks  it oversees, including the 
largest banks, to be financially sound.  Two core elements of soundness are capital and 
2 A current list of these firms is available on the Federal Reserve Board’s web page “Large Institution 
Supervision Coordinating Committee” at www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/large -institution -
supervision.htm .  This list may evolve based on changes in firms’ relative systemic importance.  Financial 
Stability Oversight Council determinations of nonbank financial institution s subject to Federal Reserve 
oversight are available on the U.S. Department of Treasury’s website at 
www.treasury.gov/initiatives/fsoc/designations/Pages/default.aspx .

holding companies and savings and loan holding companies.  To access the report, see the Board’s webpage “Reporting Forms” at www.federalreserve.gov/apps/reportforms/default.aspx .                                                    - 4 - 
liquidity.  Capital is the funds provided by a bank’s shareholders that serve as a buffer to 
enable the firm to absorb  unexpected losses, including during times of economic 
downturn or financial stress.  A bank’s liquidity is its ability to meet current and future obligations to customers and others with whom it enters into financial transactions . 
Liquidity  is the lifeblood of a financial firm, because once liquidity dries up, the firm is 
no longer able to operate.    
Beyond focusing on capital  and liquidity, the Fed also promotes safety and 
soundness by seeking to ensure that banks are well  managed and subject to strong 
governance by a board of  directors responsible to shareholders.  It is unfortunate that I 
need to underscore this, but we expect the firms we oversee to follow the law and to operate in an ethical manner.  Too often in recent years, bankers at large institutions have not done so, sometimes brazenly.  These incidents, both individually and in their totality, raise legitimate questions of whether there may be pervasive shortcomings in the values 
of large financial firms that might undermine their safety and soundness.
4   
While the F ederal Reserve looks closely at the individual safety and soundness of 
large financial firms, as I noted earlier, it is not sufficient to view each of these firms in isolation.  The safety  and soundness of large firms affects, and is affected by, the stabi lity 
of the broader financial system.  In the decades of relative financial stability leading up to the crisis, it is fair to say that the Fed focused too much on individual firms and not enough on their role in the financial system and the implications of  those firms’

operations for financial stability.  To use an apt metaphor, we looked closely at the trees 
and not as intently as we should have at the forest.  One of the most fundamental changes in the Fed’s oversight of large institutions since the crisi s, a principle that undergirds 
everything I will discuss today, is elevating the importance of financial stability in that oversight.  
The Fed oversees financial institutions through regulation and supervision.  While 
they are often closely related, these are two distinct activities.  On the one hand, regulation refers primarily to the rules that firms must follow.  Regulation starts with 
laws passed by Congress which are the basis for specific and detailed rules written by the Fed and other agencies.   Supervision, on the other hand, involves monitoring and 
examining the day -to-day operations of these firms, including their financial condition, 
how they manage risks, and their corporate governance, to make sure t hey are complying 
with laws and regulations a nd operating in a safe and sound manner.  
 The Federal Reserve Board writes the regulations firms must follow, establishes 
supervisory policies and, in close collaboration with the 12 regional Reserve Banks, is deeply engaged in the supervision of large financial institutions.  Much of the day -to-day 
work of supervision, particularly for smaller banks, occurs locally through the Reserve Banks.  For systemically important firms, the Board several years ago established the Large Institution Supervision Coordinating Committee (LISCC) in order to assure well-coordinated supervision.   
I consider the effective supervision of large institutions, to ensure their safety and 
soundness  and the stability of the financial system , to be one of the  Federal Reserve  - 6 - 
Board’s most important responsibilities, and one of my most important responsibilities  as 
Chair.  
In improving the oversight of large firms, the Federal Reserve has mad e it a top 
priority to ensure that we appropriately tailor our regulation and supervision of banks to 
their size, complexity, and risks.5  We will use statutory authorities to ensure that we 
avoid a one -size-fits-all approach as we promulgate rules and regulations.  As we 
continue this work, we will communicate to the Congress should we identify discr ete 
issues t hat may benefit from further clarification or technical changes  without 
undermining safety and soundness , such as those addressed by Congress last year related 
to capital requirements for insurance companies.  
Post-Crisis Regulation  and Supervis ion of Large Financial Institutions  
Regulatory Reform  
Regulatory changes since the crisis have been extensive.6  While my emphasis 
today is on steps taken in the United States, I should also note that we work closely with

our international colleagues to ensure that standards for systemically important financial 
firms are raised globally as well.  We have made significant progress on our regulatory reform agenda both domestically and internationally, but we still have work to do. 
I will briefly describe five  regulatory changes that have been among the most 
important in helping the Federal Reserve improve its oversight of the largest institutions.  
First, all banks are required to hold significantly more capital, with higher 
standards applied to the largest, most systemically important firms .  Second, large 
institutions have also been required to substantially increase their liquidity.  The blueprint for these higher capital and liquidity standards is an international agreement known as Basel III, which establis hes minimum standards for internationally active banks around 
the world; the United States , however, has gone even f urther to raise capital requirements 
for the largest firms.  Third, large firms are now required to show that they can continue to operate safely and serve their customers in stressful conditions similar to those that 
occurred during the crisis, an exercise known as stress testin g.  Fourth, under the Dodd-
Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd- Frank Act) , Congress 
authorized a new regime, known as “resolution,” to manage the failure of large firms in an orderly manner and reduce the chanc es that such a failure would threaten financial 
stability.  The Congress empowered the Fed and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to require large firms to develop resolution plans.   
The fifth and final regulatory change I want to mention is  that the Dodd- Frank 
Act also gave the Federal Reserve more explicit responsibilities for safeguarding financial stability .  As applied to large institutions, more stringent capital requirements

and the other regulatory changes I have just described are in tended to promote the 
stability of the financial system.  In addition, to address the fragmentation of 
responsibility for financial stability across different agencies, the Fed is part of a new interagency body, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, w hich helps U.S. regulators 
work together more effectively to better promote the stability of the financial system.   
Enhanced Supervision 
 Along with the additional tools provided by these regulatory changes, the Federal 
Reserve has fortified its supervisi on of large financial  institutions.  We significantly 
enhanced the manner by which we assess whether these firms have sufficient capital and 
liquidity and are meeting new regulatory requirements in this area. We have substantially raised our expectations f or how well the firms we supervise should be managing their 
risks, maintaining internal controls, and exercising governance.  And we have reorganized our supervision of large financial institutions to increase the quality, 
consistency, and range of perspec tives brought to bear on supervisory strategy and 
decisionmaking.  
One of the most important enhancements to large bank supervision since the 
financial crisis is our assessment of whether large institutions are holding enough capital to deal with stressful financial conditions.  The program includes stress testing and a yearly review of how firms are planning their future capital needs.
7  The latest results will 
be disclosed in the coming days.   
7 The Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review applies to a larger number of institutions than the most 
systemically important firms discussed in these remarks.                                                    - 9 - 
Capital stress testing for banks is not new but the Federal Re serve has employed it 
much more extensively since the crisis.8  Using information on a bank’s finances and 
operations, these tests gauge how a firm’s capital position would be affected by 
hypothetical scenarios covering a range of adverse economic and financial conditions.  
Such tests show the potential harm faced by individual banks in stressful conditions and thus the potential that such problems could affect the stability of the financial system.  The goal is to see that large institutions have enough ca pital not just to survive in these 
conditions , but also to continue serving their customers.  The Federal Reserve conducts 
stress tests once a year, and the firms are required to run their own tests and disclose resul ts to the public twice a year.    
Stress  testing is an important tool, but it is not sufficient to provide a full picture 
of the capital adequacy of large firms.
9  The Fed also looks at other aspects of large 
banks’ capital planning, such as their risk management, internal controls, and governance.   If the Federal Reserve is not satisfied with the results from capital stress 
tests or identifies shortcomings in a firm’s capital planning, we may restrict the firm’s ability to pay dividends, buy back shares, or take other actions that would reduce i ts 
capital base.   
In addition to these steps related to capital, in 2012 the Federal Reserve began a 
comprehensive assessment of large banks’ liquidity.
10  We review the firms’ own 
8 In addition to ad hoc stress testing th at was conducted throughout the crisis, in 2009 the Federal Reserve 
and the other U.S. federal banking agencies undertook the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program at the 
19 largest U.S. bank holding companies.  This exercise played a key role in publicly  identifying capital 
deficiencies at the largest firms and bolstering market confidence by requiring companies to address these 
deficiencies.  
9 For more information about the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review exercise and interagency 
Dodd- Frank Ac t stress -testing requirements, see the webpage “Stress Tests and Capital Planning” on the 
Board’s website at www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/stress -tests-capital -planning.htm .  
10 This Federal Reserve assessment is known as the Comprehensive Liquidity Analysis and Review.                                                    - 10 - 
liquidity stress tests , and we conduct an independent assessment of their l iquidity.  These 
liquidity exercises provide a regular opportunity for Fed supervisors to respond to 
evolving liquidity risks and firm practices over time.  Through this effort, we can require large firms to take specific actions to bolster their liquidity  or enhance the way they 
manage their liquidity risk s.   
Through stress testing and other improvements to supervision, the Federal 
Reserve is requiring more of large institutions.  We are also requiring more of ourselves.  Before the crisis, the Fed’s  supe rvision of large institutions did not make the fullest and 
most effective use of the expertise of our staff across the Federal Reserve System.  To improve our supervision of the largest systemically important firms, we have created the Large Institution Su pervision Coordinating Committee , which I mentioned earlier.  The 
LISCC  brings together experts from around the Federal Reserve System in the areas  of 
supervision, research, legal, financial market s, and payment system s in a centralized body 
led by the Federal Reserve Board.   
The LISCC program enhances supervision in several ways.  First, by looking at 
firms both individually and collectively, it helps ensure supervisors are well positioned to identify issues at individual firms as well as trends across and interconnections among firms that may pose risks to financial stability.  The LISCC also promotes high standards and consistency in the supervision of large firms through a centralized yet Systemwide approach.  By bringing together sta ff members from across the Federal Reserve System, 
the LISCC is designed to ensure that diverse views and perspectives are brought to bear on important decisions about the supervision of systemically important firms.  Lastly, the 
diversity of skills among the Fed experts involved in the LISCC allows it to consider  - 11 - 
financial stability risks from the broader economy, financial markets , and other sources .  
The LISCC also  builds  on the comprehensive analysis of financial stability by the 
Board’s Office of Finan cial Stability Policy and Research, which was established after 
the financial crisis.  
The Federal Reserve has significant responsibilities for supervising large financial 
institutions, but we cannot guarantee their stability on our own.  It is important that we 
communicate and coordinate with other U.S. financial regulatory agencies with responsibilities that affect the safety and soundness of large institutions.  We also need to cooperate with supervisors in other countries where these firms operate.  This cooperation helps us understand developments in a complex and global financial system that have implications for individual firms or for large institutions generally .  It can also 
provide information and per spective about firms whose supervision we may share with 
other agencies or governments .  In addition, it facilitates a coordinated approach to 
ensuring that large firms are operating in a safe and sound manner.  
To be effective, regulation and supervision must be independent of the entities 
subject to oversight.  You may know or have heard the term “regulatory capture.”  Regulatory capture is when a regulatory agency advances  the interests of the industry it is 
supposed to oversee rather than the broader public interest it should represent.
11  
Regulatory capture, which may occur in the oversight of any industry, can happen in both intentional and inadvertent ways.  The most blatant ways involve tangible conflicts of interest --for example the expectation gover nment officials might have of future rewards 
11 A body of economic literature addresses regulatory capture, with perhaps one of the most  influential 
works being George J. Stigler (1971), “The Theory of Economic Regulation,” Bell Journal of Economics 
and Management Science , vol. 2 (Spring), pp. 3- 21.  See also Ernesto Dal Bó (2006), “Regulatory Capture:  
A Review,” Oxford Review of Economic  Policy , vol. 22 (Summer), pp. 203- 25.                                                   - 12 - 
from the industry  they oversee.  But experience and extensive research shows that 
regulatory capture also occurs in less tangible ways, when close contact and familiarity 
between individuals leads those enforcin g the rules to sympathize with those they 
oversee.  Whatever the source, the risk of regulatory capture is something the Federal Reserve takes very seriously and works very hard to prevent.  We enforce strict ethics 
rules and promote strong values among our employees, among them a commitment to public service.  It is important that anyone serving the Fed feel safe speaking up when they have concerns about bias toward industry, and that those concerns be addressed.  The broadening of expertise and participat ion in supervision conducted by the LISCC, as 
overseen by the Board, represents yet another check to the risk of regulatory capture in the oversight of large firms.  
The Results of Improved Supervision  
I believe the changes I have described have significa ntly improved the strength 
and stability of large financial institutions and the financial system.  
As I mentioned earlier, strong capital and liquidity are fundamental  to the 
resiliency of large institutions.  T he good news is that the amount and quality of capital 
and the strength of liquidity positions at large firms are greatly improved since the crisis.   
While  some of the improvement in the capital positions of large firms is due to 
the regulatory changes I have described that are being phased in over  the next several 
years, some of it has come as a direct result of the Fed’s capital planning and stress -
testing requirements.  From early 2009 through 2014, capital held by the eight most 
systemically important U.S. bank holding companies more than doubled, reflect ing an   - 13 - 
increase of almost $500 billion in the strongest form of capital held by t hese companies .12  
Likewise, the Federal Reserve’s increased focus on liquidity has contributed to 
significant increases in firms’ liquidity.  The high -quality liquid assets held by these eight 
firms has increased by roughly one -third since 2012, and their reliance on short -term 
wholesale funding has dropped considerably .  
Beyond these very tangible gains, we see some evidence of improved risk 
management, internal controls, and governance at large firms.  But large firms still have room for improvement  in this area, and s upervisors will be watching closely.  The 
compliance breakdowns in recent years that I mentioned earlier in my remarks undermine 
confidence in large firms’ risk management and controls, which has implications for 
financial stability.  The Fed has taken and  will continue to take swift and meaningful 
action to ensure that firms focus on their risk- management practices and continue to 
strengthen them.  
Both the Federal Reserve and the large firms  we oversee have become more 
forward  looking in evaluating these f irms’ capacity to withstand significant financial 
stress, which has enhanced financial stability.  Much of this new perspective has come 
through our capital and liquidity reviews, which  require both firms and supervisors to 
make financial projections into the future rather than simply relying on current and past 
performance.  Likewise, requiring firms to plan for their possible demise and orderly 
resolution has forced them to think more carefully about the sustainability of their business models and corpora te structures.

capital regulations, and in 2014, common equity tier 1 capital, due to changes in regulatory capital

We have a m ore consistent and industry -wide perspective on risks and 
vulnerabilities  than we had prior to the crisis.  The focus  on individual firms is still 
extremely important, but we now supplement this approach more systematically with 
reviews of issues across multiple firms simultaneously.  These reviews allow us to identify common themes and unacceptable practices among large firms that will enable us to take consistent and effective action.   
Lastly, I believe the resolution authority  enacted by the Congress and our work 
with the FDIC on the orderly resolution of large institutions are reducing the problem of firms considered “too big to fail” by addressing the risks a failure of a large firm would pose to the financial system.  The pl ans developed by the largest firms to date still have a 
number of shortcomings, but the Federal Reserve has asked for and expects these institutions to make substantial progress in the coming months  which will leav e firms and 
the government better position ed to manage the failure of a large institution in an orderly 
way.

 The goal, through this and other actions I have described today, is to do whatever 
can be done to avert the dire threat and lasting damage of a severe financial crisis.  We cannot elimina te the possibility of another crisis , but we can make a crisis less likely and 
less damaging by limiting excessive risk -taking by firms we oversee and by helping 
ensure that the most systemically important firms are better prepared to weather a crisis.   
We have focused our efforts on the largest firms because they were and continue 
to be crucial to  the financial system and its ability to support the financial needs of

Rhode Island Business Leaders Day  
 
Washington, D.C.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
September 27 , 2018 
  
Good afternoon.  Thank you , Senator Reed , for the kind words and the 
opportunity to be a part of the annual Rhode Island Business Leaders Day.   And thank 
you, all, for sticking with the program for the last speaker of the day.  The Federal Open 
Market Committee, the body within the Federal Reserve that sets monetary policy, just 
concluded a meeting yesterday.  I plan to talk briefly about how my colleagues and I see 
the economy evolving and our role in keeping it healthy.  Importantly, I want to hear 
from you.  I very much appreciate your views, as business people, of economic 
conditions where you live and work.  And, of course, I  will be happy to respond to 
questions.  
Our economy is strong.  Growth is running at a healthy c lip.  Unemployment is 
low, the number of people working is rising steadily , and wages are up .  Inflation is low 
and stable.  All of these developments  are very good signs.  Of course, that is not to say 
that everything is perfect.  The benefits of this str ong economy have not reached all 
Americans.  Many of our country’s economic challenges are beyond the scope of the Fed, 
but we are doing all we can to keep the economy strong and moving forward.  That is the 
best way we can promote an environment in which every American has the opportunity 
to succeed.  
Each time we meet, we face the same question:  How can we set monetary policy 
to best support job growth and low, steady inflation?  For many years, this question 
called for very low interest rates to help an economy that had been damaged by the deep 
financial crisis that gripped the world 10 years ago.  As the economy has steadily gained 
strength, the Fed has been gradually returning interest rates closer to the levels that are 
normal in a healthy economy.  We  took another step on that path yesterday, with a  - 2 - 
quarter -point increase in short -term interest rates.  These rates remain low, and my 
colleagues and I believe that this gradual return to normal is helping to sustain this strong 
economy for the longer -run benefit of all Americans.  
As I mentioned , 10 years have now passed since the depths  of the financial 
crisis --a painful part of our history that cost many American s their jobs, their homes , and, 
for some , their hopes and dreams.   In addition to holding interest rates low to support the 
recovery , we have taken many steps to make the financial system safer.  In particular, we 
are holding the largest banks to much higher standards  in the amount of capital and 
liquidity they hold and in the ways they assess and manage the risks they take.   I am 
confident that the system today is stronger and in a far better position to support the 
financial needs of households and businesses through good times and bad.   We continue 
to work to sustain these fundamental improve ments while also ensuring that regulation is 
both effective and efficient.  
Thank you.  I am happy to take your questions.

The Economic Outlook and Implications for Monetary Policy  
   
Remarks by  
 
Michelle W. Bowman  
 
Member  
 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  
 
at 
 
The Colorado Forum  
 
Denver , Colorado  
(via webcast)  
      
May 5, 2021 
  
Thank you for this opportunity to address the members of the Colorado Forum, 
which has been an arena for thoughtful discussion and debate for more than 40 years.  
Today I would like to discuss a subject that I expect is of great interest to Coloradans and others :  the outlook for the U.S. economy in 2021.  I believe that the economy has gained 
momentum in the past several months and is well positioned to grow strongly in 2021.  Nevertheless, we have f urther to go to recover from the economic damage inflicted  by the 
COVID- 19 pandemic, and risks remain.   
As we all know, starting in late February or March of last year, widespread 
economic and social lockdowns and other effects of the pandemic caused the swiftest and deepest contraction in employment and economi c activity since the Great Depression.  
Money markets, the Treasury market, and other parts of the financial system seized up, and there were fears of another severe financial crisis.  The Federal Reserve stepped in 
quickly to assist, reviving several lend ing facilities used in the previous crisis and 
creating several new facilities.  We also cut short -term interest rates to near zero and 
began purchasing large quantities of Treasury and agency securities to help sustain the flow of credit to households and businesses.  Congress and the Administration also worked together to provide effective and timely support.  Calm was restored in financial markets, and employment and output began growing in May, but it was a very deep hole to fill.  Since that time, prog ress in controlling the pandemic has been a dominant force 
driving the economic recovery.  Rapid progress last summer gave way to slower economic growth over the turn of the year, as infection rates once again surged.  But after a substantial pickup in vac cinations and steep declines in virus -related hospitalizations 
and deaths, the economic outlook has brightened.  Job creation had stalled over the winter  - 2 - 
months but improved again starting in February.  Over the past year, we’ve seen a return 
of nearly 14 million jobs.  
Another significant factor contributing to the recovery is the resilience of private -
sector businesses.  Our  economic recovery has been more rapid and stronger than many 
forecasters expected, partly due to the ability of businesses to adapt  to conditions that 
none of them had planned for, and few even imagined could be possible.  Initially, government assistance was important, but millions of businesses were at risk of closure.  Instead, many are open and growing today due to the resourcefulne ss and determination 
of entrepreneurs and workers and their ability to adjust  business plans and operations to 
deal with the effects of social -distancing and operating restrictions.  Of course, 
technology helped a great deal, but businesses were able to fi nd many other ways to 
maintain operations and sustain their connections to customers.  In writing the history of these eventful times, I hope that the efforts of these businesses and the strength of 
America’s market- based economy get the considerable credi t they deserve.  
Recently, th e incoming data indicate that econom ic activity  is on an upswing, and 
the risks of more negative outcomes —especially those from COVID -19—appear to be 
easing.  V accinations and the easing of operating and social -distancing restr ictions are 
boosting consumer and business confidence , with the results clear to see in the data on 
spending.  Retail sales surged nearly 10 percent in March and are actually above the trendline that was interrupted by the pandemic a year ago.  One particu larly encouraging 
signal in that report was a sharp expansion in spending on food service s.  I hope this is an 
indication that consumers are finally returning to in -person dining as spring arrives and 
local authorities allow restaurants to accommodate more diners.  If so, and my fingers are  - 3 - 
crossed, it is a very good sign of further progress in one of the sectors hardest hit by the 
pandemic.  
In the job market, job gains rebounded to 916,000 in March.  At our March 
meeting, my view was broadly in line with the median of projections of other members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which anticipated the economy would grow between 5.8 percent and 6.6 percent in 2021.  But the outlook has improved since then, and it now appears that real gross domes tic product may increase close to or even 
above the higher end of that range.  This annual increase would be the largest in 36 years.   
Likewise, the FOMC median in March was for unemployment to fall to 
4.5 percent at the end of 2021, and now it seems poss ible that it may fall even further.  
With the economy continuing to reopen, I expect the pace of job creation to remain unusually strong over the spring and summer.  Over  the past few  months  many schools 
have resumed some form of in -person learning, which  should translate into a rebound in 
labor force participation as more parents overseeing virtual education and child care are 
able to increase hours or return to the workforce.       
The biggest risk to the outlook continues to be the course of the pandemic.  I see 
good reasons to be optimistic.  Vaccinations are proceeding at a rapid pace, and this 
progress is supporting decisions by state and local leaders to relax economic restrictions.  Most importantly, deaths  related to the virus ha ve continued to fall steadily and are at 
roughly the rate as in early October  of last year.  I remain hopeful that progress in the 
economic recovery can stay ahead of new challenges that might emerge, like the spread of new virus variants.  That would allow states and localities to continue easing economic and social distancing restrictions and encourage consumers and businesses to return to  - 4 - 
normal activities.   I understand that in Colorado, for example, officia ls are considering 
lifting social -distancing restrictions on individuals and businesses.  I would be interested 
to hear  from this group about how businesses in Colorado have been faring and whether 
they have seen an improvement in demand as the pandemic co nditions are easing . 
While I am optimistic about the ongoing recovery, one lesson of the past year is 
the significant degree of uncertainty about the course of the virus  and its effect on the 
economy.  We experienced periods of considerable  progress last y ear, but we saw some 
of that progress overtaken by waves of the infection late in the year.  Likewise, economic 
growth rebounded much more quickly than many had expected, but then slowed late in 2020 before regaining speed following the availability of the vaccine.    Even with recent encouraging reports on food services, activity in the travel, leisure , and hospitality sectors 
is still severely compromised , but is showing glimmers of activity .  It may be some time 
before we  know whether old habits will resume or new habits have developed that may 
define a post -pandemic new normal.  As I noted in a recent speech, I am particularly 
concerned about the longer -term effect on small businesses, many of which have held on 
with gove rnment aid and loan forbearance programs that will soon expire.
1  It will be 
several months before we know the final count of permanent small business closures 
from 2020, but it could be more than we expect . 
I will n ow tur n to how the Federal Reserve is p roceeding  in light of the strong 
signals of momentum building in the economy.  The economic recovery is not yet 
complete, and the  uncertain course of the pandemic still presents risks in the near term, 
 
1 See Michelle W. Bowman (2021), “The Economic Outlook and Prospects for Small Business ,” speech 
delivered at the Economic Club of Oklahoma, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (via webcast) , March 22,

which is  why my colleagues and I on the FOMC decided l ast week to maintain our highly 
accommodative stance of monetary policy.  Despite the progress to date and the signs of 
acceleration in the recovery, employment is still considerably short of where it was when 
the pandemic disrupted the economy and it is w ell below where it should be, considering 
the pre -pandemic trend.  In particular , our maximum employment mandate is intended as 
a broad and inclusive goal increasing employment and opportunity, but I remain 
concerned that employment gains for some minority  groups have lagged behind those of 
other s.  While job creation has been and is expected to remain strong, the pace will 
eventually slow as the share of those who have been unemployed for the longer -term 
increases among those who are looking for work.  We are making good progress toward 
our full employment goal , but we still have a long way to go, and risks remain.  
This brings me to the other side of our policy mandate.  Over the next several 
months, I expect that headline inflation measures will move above our long- run target of 
2 percent.  A main reason I expect this outcome is simply the fact that the very low inflation readings during last spring’s deep economic contraction will drop from the usual 
calculation of 12- month price changes.  But in addition, the unusually rapid rebound in 
economic activity that we’ve seen, along with the pandemic -driven shift towards goods 
purchases, has led to supply -chain bottlenecks in a number of areas, which in turn have 
pushed up prices for many goods.  One prominent example is with semiconductor producers and their need to dramatically alter the mix of production to meet demands  of 
the high -tech and automotive industries.  Although I expect these upward price pressures 
to ease after the temporary supply bottlenecks are resolved, the exact timing of that dynamic is uncertain.  If the supply bottlenecks prove to be more long- lastin g than  - 6 - 
currently expected, I will adjust my views on the inflation outlook accordingly.  At this 
point, the risk that inflation remains persistently above our long -run target of 2  percent 
still appears small.  
In summary, let me say that I am encouraged by the recent pace of the economic 
recovery, and I remain optimistic that this strength will continue in the coming months.  One reason for my optimism is that businesses have been effective in responding to the challenges posed by the pandemic and by economi c restrictions implemented in efforts to 
contain it.  We really can’t know how the pandemic will proceed and how that will affect the U.S. economy, but I think we are currently on a good path, and our policy is in a good place.   Thank you again for inviting me  to speak to you today, and I would be happy to 
respond to your questions.    ",2021-05-05,bowman

The U.S. Economic Outlook 
 
  
Remarks by 
 
Ben S. Bernanke 
 
Chairman 
 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
 
at the 
 
International Monetary Conference 
 
Atlanta, Georgia 
       
June 7, 2011  
 I would like to thank the organizers for inviting me to participate once again in 
the International Monetary Conf erence.  I will begin with a brief update on the outlook 
for the U.S. economy, then discuss recent de velopments in global commodity markets 
that are significantly affecting both the U. S. and world economies, and conclude with 
some thoughts on the prosp ects for monetary policy.  
The Outlook for Growth 
U.S. economic growth so far this year l ooks to have been so mewhat slower than 
expected.  Aggregate output increased at only 1.8 percent at an annual rate in the first 
quarter, and supply chain disrupt ions associated with the ear thquake and tsunami in Japan 
are hampering economic activity this quarter.  A number of indicator s also suggest some 
loss of momentum in the labor market in r ecent weeks.  We are, of course, monitoring 
these developments.  That said, with the eff ects of the Japanese di saster on manufacturing 
output likely to dissipate in coming months, and with some moderation in gasoline prices 
in prospect, growth seems likely to pick up somewhat in the second half of the year.  
Overall, the economic recovery appears to be  continuing at a modera te pace, albeit at a 
rate that is both uneven acro ss sectors and frustratingly sl ow from the perspective of 
millions of unemployed and underemployed workers.   As is often the case, the ability and w illingness of households to spend will be an 
important determinant of the pace at which the economy expands in coming quarters.  A 
range of positive and negative forces is curr ently influencing both household finances and 
attitudes.  On the positive side, house hold incomes have been boosted by the net 
improvement in job market conditions since earl ier this year as well as from the reduction 
in payroll taxes that the C ongress passed in December.  Increases in household wealth-- 
 - 2 -
largely reflecting gains in equity values--a nd lower debt burdens have also increased 
consumers’ willingness to spend.  On the negative side, households are facing some significant headwinds, including increases in food and energy prices, declining home 
values, continued tightness in some credit markets, and still-high unemployment, all of which have taken a toll on consumer confidence.   Developments in the labor market will be of particular importance in setting the course for household spending.  As you know, the jobs situation remains far from normal.  
For example, aggregate hours of production wo rkers--a comprehensive measure of labor 
input that reflects the extent of part-tim e employment and opportunities for overtime as 
well as the number of people employed--fell,  remarkably, by nearly 10 percent from the 
beginning of the recent recession through Oc tober 2009.  Although hours of work have 
increased during the expansion, this measure still remains about 6-1/2 percent below its 
pre-recession level.  For comparison, the maximum decline in aggregate hours worked in 
the deep 1981-82 recession was less than 6 per cent.  Other indicators, such as total 
payroll employment, the ratio of employmen t to population, and the unemployment rate, 
paint a similar picture.  Particularly con cerning is the very high level of long-term 
unemployment--nearly half of  the unemployed have been jobless for more than six 
months.  People without work for long periods can find it increasingly difficult to obtain 
a job comparable to their previous one, as th eir skills tend to deteriorate over time and as 
employers are often reluctant to  hire the long-term unemployed. 
 Although the jobs market remains quite weak and progress has been uneven, overall we have seen signs of gradual improve ment.  For example, private-sector payrolls 
increased at an average rate of about 180,000 per month over the first five months of this  
 - 3 -
year, compared with less than 140,000 during the last four months  of 2010 and less than 
80,000 per month in the four months prior to th at.  As I noted, however, recent indicators 
suggest some loss of momentum, with last Friday’s jobs market report showing an 
increase in private payrolls of just 83,000 in May.  I expect hiring to pick up from last 
month’s pace as growth strengthens in the s econd half of the year , but, again, the recent 
data highlight the need to continue m onitoring the jobs situation carefully.  
 The business sector generally presents a more upbeat picture.  Capital spending 
on equipment and software has continued to expand, reflecting an improving sales 
outlook and the need to replace aging capital.  Many U.S. firms, notably in manufacturing 
but also in services, have benefited from the strong growth of demand in foreign markets.  
Going forward, investment and hiring in the private sector should be facilitated by the 
ongoing improvement in credit conditions.  La rger businesses remain able to finance 
themselves at historically low interest ra tes, and corporate bala nce sheets are strong.  
Smaller businesses still face difficulties in obt aining credit, but surveys of both banks and 
borrowers indicate that cond itions are slowly improving for those firms as well.  
In contrast, virtually all segments of the construction industry remain troubled.  In 
the residential sector, low home prices and mortgage ra tes imply that housing is quite 
affordable by historical standards; yet, w ith underwriting standards for home mortgages 
having tightened considerably, many potenti al homebuyers are unable to qualify for 
loans.  Uncertainties about job prospects and the future course of house prices have also 
deterred potential buyers.  Given these cons traints on the demand for housing, and with a 
large inventory of vacant and foreclosed pr operties overhanging the market, construction 
of new single-family homes has remained at  very low levels, and house prices have  
 - 4 -
continued to fall.  The housing sector typi cally plays an important role in economic 
recoveries; the depressed state of housing in the United States is a big reason that the 
current recovery is less vigor ous than we would like.  
Developments in the public sector also help determine the pace of recovery.  
Here, too, the picture is one of relative wea kness.  Fiscally constrained state and local 
governments continue to cut spending and em ployment.  Moreover, the impetus provided 
to the growth of final demand by federal fiscal policies continues to wane.   
The prospect of increasing fiscal drag on the recovery highlights one of the many 
difficult tradeoffs faced by fiscal policymakers:   If the nation is to have a healthy 
economic future, policymakers urgently need to put the federal government’s finances on 
a sustainable trajectory.  But, on the other hand, a sharp fiscal consolidation focused on 
the very near term could be self-defeating if it were to undercut the st ill-fragile recovery.  
The solution to this dilemma, I believe, lie s in recognizing that our nation’s fiscal 
problems are inherently long-term in nature.  Consequently, the appropriate response is to 
move quickly to enact a credible, long-term  plan for fiscal consolidation.  By taking 
decisions today that lead to  fiscal consolidation over a longer horizon, policymakers can 
avoid a sudden fiscal contracti on that could put the recovery at risk.  At the same time, 
establishing a credible plan for reducing fu ture deficits now would not only enhance 
economic performance in the long run, but coul d also yield near-ter m benefits by leading 
to lower long-term interest rates and in creased consumer and business confidence. 
The Outlook for Inflation 
 Let me turn to the outlook for inflation.  As you all know, over the past year, 
prices for many commodities have risen sh arply, resulting in  significantly higher  
 - 5 -
consumer prices for gasoline and other ener gy products and, to a somewhat lesser extent, 
for food.  Overall inflation measures reflect th ese price increases:  For example, over the 
six months through April, the price index for personal consumption expenditures has 
risen at an annual rate of about 3-1/2 percen t, compared with an average of less than 1 
percent over the preceding two years. 
Although the recent increase in inflation is  a concern, the appropriate diagnosis 
and policy response depend on whether the rise in inflation is likely to persist.  So far at 
least, there is not much evidence that infla tion is becoming broad-ba sed or ingrained in 
our economy; indeed, increases in the price of a single produc t--gasoline--account for the 
bulk of the recent increase in consumer price inflation.1  Of course, gasoline prices are 
exceptionally important for both family financ es and the broader economy; but the fact 
that gasoline price increa ses alone account for so much of the overall increase in inflation 
suggests that developments in the global ma rket for crude oil and related products, as 
well as in other commodities markets, ar e the principal factors behind the recent 
movements in inflation, rather than factors specific to the U.S. economy.  An important 
implication is that if the prices of energy and other commodities stabilize in ranges near 
current levels, as futures markets and many forecasters predict, the upward impetus to overall price inflation will wane and the recent increase in inflation will prove transitory.  
Indeed, the declines in many commodity prices seen over th e past few weeks may be an 
indication that such moderation is occurring.  I will discuss commodity prices further 
momentarily. 
                                                
 
1 Through April, personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation over the previous six months was 
3.6 percent at an annual rate; excluding gasoline, inflation over that period was 2 percent.  Over a 12-month 
span, inflation through April was 2.2 percent; excluding gasoline, it was 1.2 percent.  
 - 6 -
Besides the prospect of more-stable comm odity prices, two other factors suggest 
that inflation is likely to return to more subdued levels in the medium term.  First, the 
still-substantial slack in U.S. labor and product markets should continue to have a 
moderating effect on inflationary pressures.   Notably, because of the weak demand for 
labor, wage increases have not kept pace with  productivity gains.  Thus the level of unit 
labor costs in the business sector is lower th an it was before the recession.  Given the 
large share of labor costs in the production costs of most firms (typically, a share far 
larger than that of raw materials cost s), subdued unit labor costs should remain a 
restraining influence on inflation.  To be clea r, I am not arguing that healthy increases in 
real wages are inconsistent with low inflation;  the two are perfectly consistent so long as 
productivity growth is reasonably strong.   
The second additional factor restraining in flation is the stability of longer-term 
inflation expectations.  De spite the recent pickup in ove rall inflation, measures of 
households’ longer-term inflation expectations  from the Michigan survey, the 10-year 
inflation projections of prof essional economists, the 5-year-f orward measure of inflation 
compensation derived from yields on inflation- protected securities, and other measures of 
longer-term inflation exp ectations have all remain ed reasonably stable.2  As long as 
longer-term inflation expectati ons are stable, increases in global commodity prices are 
unlikely to be built into domestic wage- a nd price-setting proce sses, and they should 
therefore have only transitory e ffects on the rate of inflation.  That said, the stability of 
                                                 
2 In the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surv eys of Consumers, the medi an reading on expected 
inflation over the next 5 to 10 years was 2.9 percent in May after having averaged 2.8 percent in 2010.  In the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) compiled by the Federa l Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, the 
median projection for PCE inflation over the next 10 years was 2.3 percent in May, up from the 2.1 percent 
average reading last year.  The equivalent SPF projection for CPI inflation was 2.4 percent, versus 2.3 percent in 2010.  The 5-year forward measure of inflation compensation derived from TIPS stood at 
about 2-3/4 percent in May, down  noticeably from the levels obse rved toward the end of 2010.  
 - 7 -
inflation expectations is ensu red only as long as the commitm ent of the central bank to 
low and stable inflation remains credible.  Thus, the Federal Reserve will continue to 
closely monitor the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations and will take 
whatever actions are necessary to  keep inflation well controlled. 
Commodity Prices 
 As I noted earlier, the rise in commodity prices has directly increased the rate of 
inflation while also adversely affecting cons umer confidence and consumer spending.  
Let’s look at these price in creases in closer detail. 
The basic facts are familiar.  Oil prices have risen significantly, with the spot 
price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil near $100 per barrel as of the end of last 
week, up nearly 40 percent from a year ago.  Proportionally, prices of corn and wheat 
have risen even more, roughly doubling over th e past year.  And pr ices of industrial 
metals have increased notably as well, w ith aluminum and copper prices up about one-
third over the past 12 months.  When th e price of any product moves sharply, the 
economist’s first instinct is to look for changes in the supply of or demand for that 
product.  And indeed, the recent increase in co mmodity prices appears largely to be the 
result of the same factors that drove co mmodity prices higher throughout much of the 
past decade:  strong gains in global demand th at have not been met with commensurate 
increases in supply.  
From 2002 to 2008, a period of sustained in creases in commodity prices, world 
economic activity registered its fastest pace of expansion in decades, rising at an average 
rate of about 4-1/2 percent per year.  Th is impressive performance was led by the 
emerging and developing economies, where re al activity expanded at a remarkable 7

percent per annum.  The emerging market econo mies have likewise led the way in the 
recovery from the global financial crisis :  From 2008 to 2010, real gross domestic 
product (GDP) rose cumulatively by about 10 percent in the emerging market economies 
even as GDP was essentially unchanged, on net, in the advanced economies.3   
Naturally, increased economic activit y in emerging market economies has 
increased global demand for raw materials.  Moreover, the heavy emphasis on industrial 
development in many emerging market economies has led their growth to be particularly 
intensive in the use of commodities, even  as the consumption of commodities in 
advanced economies has stabilized or decline d.  For example, world oil consumption rose 
by 14 percent from 2000 to 2010; underl ying this overall trend, however, was a 
40 percent increase in oil use in emerging ma rket economies and an outright decline of 
4-1/2 percent in the advanced economies.  In particular, U.S. oil consumption was about 
2-1/2 percent lower in 2010 than  in 2000, with net imports of  oil down nearly 10 percent, 
even though U.S. real GDP rose by n early 20 percent over that period. 
  This dramatic shift in the sources of demand for commodities is not unique to oil.  
If anything, the pattern is even more stri king for industrial metals, where double-digit 
percentage rates of decline in consump tion by the advanced economies over the past 
decade have been overwhelmed by triple-digit  percentage increases in consumption by 
the emerging market economies.4  Likewise, improving diets in the emerging market 
economies have significantly increased th eir demand for agricultural commodities.  
                                                 
3 The GDP data cited here are from the International Monetary Fund’s World Economic Outlook database.  
The difference between the advanced and emerging mark et economies is also evident in the statistics on 
industrial production, which is perhaps more directly relevant to the demand for commodities.  According 
to the CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis, from March 2009 to March 2010, industrial 
production rose 26 percent in the emerging market economies and 11 percent in the advanced economies. 
4 A portion of commodity use in the emerging market economies serves as inputs to the production of 
exports, some of which are ultimately consumed in advanced economies.

Importantly, in noting these facts, I intend no criticism of emerging markets; growth in 
those economies has conferred substantial econ omic benefits both within those countries 
and globally, and in any case, the consumpti on of raw materials re lative to population in 
emerging-market countries remains substantia lly lower than in the United States and 
other advanced economies.  Nevertheless, it is  undeniable that the tremendous growth in 
emerging market economies has considerably  increased global demand for commodities 
in recent years.  Against this backdrop of extremely ro bust growth in demand, the supply of many 
commodities has lagged behind.  For example, world oil production has increased less than 1 percent per year since 2004, compared wi th nearly 2 percent per year in the prior 
decade.  In part, the slower increase in the supply of oil reflected disappointing rates of 
production in countries that are not part of  the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting 
Countries (OPEC).  However, OPEC has not shown much willingness to ramp up 
production, either.  Most recently, OPEC pr oduction fell 1.3 million barrels per day from 
January to April of this year , reflecting the disruption to Li byan supplies and the lack of 
any significant offset from other OPEC pr oducers.  Indeed, OPEC’s production of oil 
today remains about 3 million barrels per day below the peak level of mid-2008.  With the demand for oil rising rapidly and the supply of crude stagnant, incr eases in oil prices 
are hardly a puzzle. 
Production shortfalls have plagued many ot her commodities as well.  Agricultural 
output has been hard hit by a spate of bad weather around the globe.  For example, last 
summer’s drought in Russia severely reduced that country’s wheat crop.  In the United 
States, high temperatures signi ficantly impaired the U.S. corn crop last fall, and dry  
 - 10 -
conditions are currently hurting the wheat crop in Kansas.  Ov er the past year, droughts 
have also afflicted Argentina, China, and France.  Fortunately, the lag between planting 
and harvesting for many crops is relatively short; thus, if more-t ypical weather patterns 
resume, supplies of agricultural commodities should rebound, thereby reducing the pressure on prices. 
Not all commodity prices have increase d, illustrating the point that supply and 
demand conditions can vary across markets.  For example, prices for both lumber and 
natural gas are currently near their levels of the early 2000s.  The demand for lumber has 
been curtailed by weakness in the U.S. constr uction sector, while th e supply of natural 
gas in the United States has been increas ed by significant innovations in extraction 
techniques.
5  Among agricultural commodities, rice prices have remained relatively 
subdued, reflecting favorable growing conditions. 
In all, these cases reinforce the view th at the fundamentals of global supply and 
demand have been playing a central role in recent swings in commodity prices.  That 
said, there is usually signif icant uncertainty about current  and prospective supply and 
demand.  Accordingly, commodity prices, like the prices of financial assets, can be 
volatile as market participants react to in coming news.  Recently, commodity prices seem 
to have been particularly responsive to  news bearing on the prospects for global 
economic growth as well as geopolitical developments.   
As the rapid growth of emerging mark et economies seems likely to continue, 
should we therefore expect c ontinued rapid increases in th e prices of globally-traded 
commodities?  While it is certainly possible th at we will see further increases, there are 
                                                 
5 As natural gas is difficult to transport overseas, the increased supplies of natural gas in North America 
have not translated into significantly lower prices abroad .  In the first quarter of 2011, natural gas prices in 
the United States were less than half of those in Germany.    
 - 11 -
good reasons to believe that commodity prices wi ll not continue to rise  at the rapid rates 
we have seen recently.  In the short run, une xpected shortfalls in the supplies of key 
commodities result in sharp price increases, as  usage patterns and available supplies are 
difficult to change quickly.  Over longer periods, however, high levels of commodity 
prices curtail demand as households and firms adjust their spending and production 
patterns.  Indeed, as I noted earlier, we have already seen  significant reductions in 
commodity use in the advanced economies.  Likewise, over time, high prices should elicit 
meaningful increases in supply, both as temporar y factors, such as a dverse weather, abate 
and as investments in productive capacity come to fruition.  Finally, because expectations 
of higher prices lead financial market pa rticipants to bid up the spot prices of 
commodities, predictable future developmen ts bearing on the demands for and supplies 
of commodities tend already to be reflected in  current prices.  For these reasons, although 
unexpected developments could certainly l ead to continued volatility in global 
commodity prices, it is reasona ble to expect the effects of  commodity prices on overall 
inflation to be relatively moderate in the medium term. 
While supply and demand fundamentals surely account for most of the recent 
movements in commodity prices, some observers  have attributed a significant portion of 
the run-up in prices to Federal Reserve po licies, over and above the effects of those 
policies on U.S. economic growth.  For exam ple, some have argued that accommodative 
U.S. monetary policy has driven down the fo reign exchange value of the dollar, thereby 
boosting the dollar price of commodities.  Indeed, since February 2009, the trade-
weighted dollar has fallen by about 15 percen t.  However, since February 2009, oil prices 
have risen 160 percent and nonfuel commod ity prices are up by about 80 percent,  
 - 12 -
implying that the dollar’s declin e can explain, at most , only a small part of the rise in oil 
and other commodity prices; i ndeed, commodity prices have risen dramatically when 
measured in terms of any of the world’s majo r currencies, not just the dollar.  But even 
this calculation overstates the role of m onetary policy, as many factors other than 
monetary policy affect the valu e of the dollar.  For exampl e, the decline in the dollar 
since February 2009 that I just noted followed a comparable increase in the dollar, which 
largely reflected flight-to-safety flows triggere d by the financial crisis in the latter half of 
2008; the dollar’s decline si nce then in substantial part refl ects the reversal of those flows 
as the crisis eased.  Slow growth in the Un ited States and a persistent trade deficit are 
additional, more fundamental sources of r ecent declines in the dollar’s value; in 
particular, as the United States is a major oil importer, any geopolitical or other shock 
that increases the global pr ice of oil will worsen our tr ade balance and economic outlook, 
which tends to depress the dollar.  In this case, the direction of causality runs from 
commodity prices to the dollar rather than the other way around.  The best way for the 
Federal Reserve to support the fundamental valu e of the dollar in the medium term is to 
pursue our dual mandate of maximum empl oyment and price stability, and we will 
certainly do that.  
Another argument that has been made is  that low interest rates have pushed up 
commodity prices by reducing the cost of hol ding inventories, thus boosting commodity 
demand, or by encouraging speculators to pus h commodity futures prices above their 
fundamental levels.  In either case, if su ch forces were driving commodity prices 
materially and persistently higher, we s hould see corresponding increases in commodity 
inventories, as higher prices  curtailed consumption and boosted production relative to  
 - 13 -
their fundamental levels.  In fact, invent ories of most commodities have not shown 
sizable increases over the past year as prices rose; indeed, increases in prices have often 
been associated with lower rather than hi gher levels of inventor ies, likely reflecting 
strong demand or weak supply that tends to  put pressure on available stocks.   
Finally, some have suggested that very lo w interest rates in the United States and 
other advanced economies have created risks of economic overheating in emerging market economies and have thus indirectly put upward pressures on commodity prices.  
In fact, most of the recent rapid economic gr owth in emerging market economies appears 
to reflect a bounceback from the previ ous recession and continuing increases in 
productive capacity, as their technologies and capital stocks catch up with those in 
advanced economies, rather than being prim arily the result of monetary conditions in 
those countries.  More fundamentally, however , whatever the source of the recent growth 
in the emerging markets, the authorities in t hose economies clearly have a range of fiscal, 
monetary, exchange rate, and other tools that can be used to address any overheating that 
may occur.  As in all countries, the prim ary objective of monetary policy in the United 
States should be to promote economic growth and price stability at home, which in turn supports a stable global economic  and financial environment. 
Monetary Policy 
Let me conclude with a few words about the current stance of  monetary policy.  
As I have discussed today, the economic recovery in the United States appears to be proceeding at a moderate pace and--notwithst anding unevenness in the rate of progress 
and some recent signs of reduced momentum--the labor market has been gradually improving.  At the same time, the jobs s ituation remains far from normal, with  
 - 14 -
unemployment remaining elevated.  Inflati on has risen lately but should moderate, 
assuming that commodity prices stabilize and that, as I expect, l onger-term inflation 
expectations remain stable.   
Against this backdrop, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has 
maintained a highly accommodative monetary policy, keeping its target for the federal 
funds rate close to zero and further easing monetary conditions through large-scale asset 
purchases.  The FOMC has indicated that it wi ll complete its purchases of $600 billion of 
Treasury securities by the end of this mont h while maintaining its existing policy of 
reinvesting principal payments from its securities holdings.  The Committee also 
continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely  to warrant exceptionally low 
levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period. 
The U.S. economy is recovering from both the worst financial crisis and the most 
severe housing bust since th e Great Depression, and it f aces additional headwinds 
ranging from the effects of the Japanese di saster to global pre ssures in commodity 
markets.  In this context, monetary polic y cannot be a panacea.  Still, the Federal 
Reserve’s actions in recent years have doub tless helped stabilize the financial system, 
ease credit and financial conditions, guard  against deflation, and promote economic 
recovery.  All of this has been accomplished, I should note, at no net cost to the federal 
budget or to the U.S. taxpayer.  Although it is moving in the right dir ection, the economy is still producing at 
levels well below its potential; consequently, accommodative monetary policies are still needed.  Until we see a sustained period of stronger job creation, we cannot consider the 
recovery to be truly established.  At the sa me time, the longer-run health of the economy  
 - 15 -
requires that the Federal Reserve be vigilant  in preserving its hard-won credibility for 
maintaining price stability.  As I have expl ained, most FOMC participants currently see 
the recent increase in  inflation as transitory and expect  inflation to remain subdued in the 
medium term.  Should that forecast prove wrong , however, and particularly if signs were 
to emerge that inflation was becoming more broadly based or that longer-term inflation 
expectations were becoming less well anchored, the Committee would respond as 
necessary.  Under all circumstances, our pol icy actions will be guided by the objectives 
of supporting the recovery in output and employment while he lping ensure that inflation, 
over time, is at levels consistent with the Federal Reserve’s mandate.  ",2011-06-07,bernanke

Washington, D.C. 
       
November 9, 2023  
  
Thank you for the opportunity to participate in today’s panel discussion.  My 
assigned topic is U.S. monetary policy in the current global inflation episode.  I will 
briefly address the U.S. outlook and then turn to three broader questions raised by the 
historic events of the pandemic era.  
U.S. inflation has come down over the past year  but remains well above our 
2 percent target  (figure 1).1  My colleagues and I are gratified by this progress but expect 
that the process of getting inflation sustainably down to 2 percent has a long way to go.  
The labor market remains tight, although improvements in labor supply and a gradual 
easing in demand continue to move it into better balance.2  Gross domestic product  
growth in the third quarter was quite strong, but, like most forecasters, we  expect growth 
to moderate in coming quarters.  Of course, that remains to be seen, and we are attentive 
to the risk that  stronger growth could undermine further progress in restoring balance to 
the labor market and in bringing inflation down, which could warrant a response from 
monetary policy.  The Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) is committed to 
achieving a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation 
down to 2 percent over time ; we are not confident that we have achieved such a stance.  
We know that ongoing progress toward our 2 percent goal is not assured:  Inflation has 
 
1 Inflation under our preferred measure, the 12- month change in the total personal consumption 
expenditures (PCE) price index, has declined from 6.6 percent in September 2022 to 3.4 percent in 
September 2023.  The 12- month change in the core PCE measure, which excludes the volatile food and 
energy prices and therefore may provide a better signal of where inflation is headed, has declined from 5.5 
percent in September 2022 to 3.7 percent in September 2023.  
2 The labor force participation rate has moved up since late last year, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 
54 years, where that rate has increased by nearly 1 percentage point, on net, since December.  Private 
payrolls increased by an average of 191,000 per month over the 12 months ending in October 2023, down 
from a rate of 435,000 per month over the 12 months ending in October 2022.  Meanwhile, both the quits 
rate and the wage premium for job switchers have returned to their pre -pandemic ranges.  And while they 
remain above a level that would be consistent with 2 percent inflation in the longer run, broad indicators of 
12-month wage growth continue to trend lower.   - 2 - 
given us a few head fakes.  If it becomes appropriate to tighten policy further, we will not 
hesitate to do so.  We will continue to move carefully, however, allowing us to address both the risk of being misled by a few good months of data , and the risk of 
overtightening.  We are making decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the 
incoming data  and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation, 
as well as the balance of risks , determining the extent of additional polic y firming that 
may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time.  W e will keep at it until the 
job is done.   
With that, I will turn to three questions that have arisen  from the receding but still 
elevated inflation w e are experiencing today.  The first question is , with the benefit of 
2-1/2 years to look back, what we can say about the initial causes and ongoing policy 
implications of the current inflation .    
After running below our 2 percent target over the first year of the pandemic, core 
PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation rose sharply in March 2021.  Economic forecasters generally did not see this coming, as shown by the February 2021 
Survey of Professional Forecasters, which showed core PCE inflation running at or below target over the subsequent three years.
3  The real -time questions for policymakers were 
what caused the high inflation and how policy should react.  At the outset, many forecasters and analysts, including FOMC participants , viewed the sudden upturn in 
inflation as mostly a function of pandemic -related shifts in the composition of demand, a 
disruption of supply chains, and a sharp decline in labor supply.  The resulting supply and demand imbalances led to large increases  in the prices of a range of items most directly 
 
3 The median projections of Q4 -to-Q4 core PCE inflation from the February 2021 Survey of Professional 
Forecasters were 1.8 percent, 1.9 percent, and 2.0 percent for 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively.   - 3 - 
affected by the pandemic, especially goods.  In this view, as the pandemic abated, our 
dynamic and flexible economy was likely to adapt fairly quickly.  S upply disruptions and 
shortages would diminish.  Labor supply would rebound, a ided by the arrival of vaccines 
and the reopening of schools.  Elevated demand for goods would shift back to services.  Inflation would ease reasonably quickly without  the need for a significant policy 
response.
4     
Indeed, although monthly core PCE inflation spiked in March and April of 2021, 
beginning in May it declined for five consecutive  months, providing some support for  
this view (figure 2).   But in the fourth  quarter of 2021, the data clearly changed amid 
waves of new COVID -19 variants, with only gradual progress in restoring global supply 
chains, and relatively few workers rejoining the labor force.  That lack of progress, combined with very strong demand from households, contributed to a tight economy and a historically tight labor market, and more persistent high inflation. 
The Committee signaled a change in our policy approach , and financial conditions 
began to tighten.  A new shock arrived in February 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine, resulting in a sharp increase in energy and other commodity prices .  When we lifted off  in 
March , it was clear that bringing down inflation would depend both on the unwinding of 
the unprecedented pandemic -related demand and supply distortions and on our tightening 
of monetary policy, which would slow the growth of aggregate demand, allowing supply time to catch up.  Today, t hese two processes are working together to bring inflation 
down.  The FOMC has raised the federal funds rate target range  by 5- 1/4 percentage 
 
4 Both the June S ummary of E conomic Projections  and the August Survey of Professional Forecasters 
showed a near -uniform view that the incipient inflation would pass quickly and that inflation for 2022 
would run near 2 percent.  Neither the forecasters nor policymakers foresaw more than a modest tightening 
of monetary policy.   - 4 - 
points and reduced our  securities holdings by more than  $1 trillion.  Monetary policy is in 
restrictive territory and putting downward pressure on demand and inflation.   
The unwinding of pandemic -related supply and demand distortions is playing an 
important role in the decline of inflation.  For example , wage growth has steadily fallen 
by most measures since mid -2022 (figure 3), despite continued robust job gains, 
reflecting a resurgence in labor supply thanks to higher labor force participation and a 
return of immigration to pre -pandemic levels.   
While the broader supply recovery continues, it is not clear how much more will 
be achieved by additional supply- side improvements.  Going forward, it may be that a 
greater share of the progress in reducing inflation will have to come from tight monetary policy restraining the growth of aggregate demand.
5  
Turning to my second question, f or many  years, it has been generally thought  that 
monetary policy should limit its response to, or “look through,”  supply shocks to the 
extent that they are temporary  and idiosyncratic.6  Many argue  as well  that, in the future, 
supply disruptions are likely to be more frequent or more persistent than in the decades just before  the pandemic.
7  A second question, then, is what we have learned about the 
standard “looking through” approach.   
The idea that the response to the inflationary  effects of supply shocks should be 
attenuated arises, in part, from the tradeoff presented by those shocks.  Supply shocks 
 
5 See, for example, Ben Bernanke and Olivier Blanchard (2023), “ What Caused the U.S. Pandemic- Era 
Inflation? ” Hutchins Center Working Paper 86 (Washington:  Brookings Institution, Hutchins Center on 
Fiscal and Monetary Policy, June), https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what- caused -the-u-s-pandemic -era-
inflation .  
6 As I will return to later, this presumes that inflation expectations are well anchored.  
7 See, for example, Agustín Carstens (2022), “ A Story of Tailwinds and Headwinds:  Aggregate Supply and 
Macroeconomic Stabilization ,” remarks delivered at “Reassessing Constraints on the Economy and 
Policy ,” a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson Hole , Wyo., 
August 26, https://www.kansascityfed.org/Jackson%20Hole/documents/9668/JH2022_Carstens.pdf .   - 5 - 
tend to move prices and employment in opposite directions, whereas monetary policy 
pushes each in the same direction.  Therefore, the response of monetary policy to higher prices stemming from an adverse supply shock should be attenuated because it would otherwise amplify the unwanted decline in employment.
8  In addition, supply shocks 
have most frequently come from the volatile food and energy categories and have pass ed 
quickly.  While food and energy prices critically affect the budgets of households and 
businesses, the  policy tools of central banks work  more slowly than commodity markets 
move.  Responding aggressively to quickly passing price increases could exacerbate macroeconomic volatility without supporting price stability.   
Our experience since 2020 highlights some  limits of that thinking.  To begin with, 
it can be challenging to disentangle supply shocks from demand shocks in real time, and also to determine how long either will persist, particularly in the extraordinary circumstances of the past three years.  S upply shocks that have a persistent effect on 
potential output could call for restrictive policy to better align aggregate demand with the suppressed level of aggregate supply.  The sequence of shocks to global supply chains 
experienced from 2020 to 2022 suppressed output for a considerable time and may have persistently altered global supply dynamics.  Such a sequence calls on policymakers to use policy restraint to limit inflationary effects.  
Policy restraint in this case is also  good risk management.  Supply shocks that 
drive inflation high enough for long enough can affect the longer -term inflation 
expectations of households and businesses.  M onetary policy must forthrightly address 
 
8 For an example in the context of energy price shocks, see  Martin Bodenstein, Christopher J. Erceg, and 
Luca Guerrieri (2008), “Optimal Monetary Policy with Distinct Core and Headline Inflation Rates, ” 
Journal of Monetary Economics , supp., vol. 55 (October), pp. S18– 33.   - 6 - 
any risks of a potential de -anchoring of inflation expectations , as well -anchored 
expectations help facilitate bringing inflation back to our target .  The sharp policy 
tightening during 2022 likely contributed to keeping inflation expectations well anchored.       
My t hird question is the level where interest rates will settle once the effects of 
the pandemic are truly behind us.  By 2019, the general level of nominal interest rates had 
declined steadily over several decades  (figure 4).  As the pandemic arrived, many 
advanced economies had below -target inflation and low or mildly negative policy rates, 
raising difficult questions about the efficacy of interest rate policy when constrained by the effective lower bound (ELB).  Over two decades, an extensive literature had identified a number of possible changes to the widely used inflation- targeting regime, 
including negative policy rates , nominal income targeting , and various forms of makeup 
strategies under which persistent shortfalls in inflation would be followed by a period of inflation running moderately above 2 percent.
9  Today, inflation and policy rates are 
elevated, and the ELB is not currently relevant for our policy decisions.  But it is too soon

review; see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2020), “Review of Monetary Policy

monetary policy strategy, see Fernando Duarte, Benjamin K. Johannsen, Leonardo Melosi, and Taisuke

to say whether the monetary policy challenges  of the ELB will ultimately turn out to be a 
thing of the past . 
The prolonged proximity of interest  rates to the ELB  was at the heart of the 
monetary policy review and the changes we made to our framework in 2020.  We will 
begin our next five -year review in the latter half of 2024 and announce the results about a 
year later .  Among the questions we will consider is the degree to which the structural 
features of the economy that led to low interest rates in the pre -pandemic era will persist.  
With time, we will continue to learn from  the experience of the past few years, and what 
implications it may hold for monetary policy.  
These are just three of the many  questions raised by these challenging times , and 
we are far from a complete understanding of the  answers .  I appreciate the opportunity to 
discuss these issues with you today and look forward to our conversation.  Opening Remarks

Today I will briefly discuss the current economic situation and the stresses that 
emerged in the U.S. banking system earlier this year.  I will then turn to the evolution of 
the financial system since the Great Recession and conclude with a few general observations.  I will highlight how global efforts to boost resilience in the financial sector 
over the p ast decade have been an important success.  I will also discuss how recent 
developments have revealed residual vulnerabilities that we are going to address, and the need to be vigilant for emerging risks.   
U.S. economic growth slowed significantly last ye ar, and recent indicators 
suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a modest pace.  Growth in consumer spending has picked up this year, and some indicators in the housing market have turned up recently.  At the same time, activity in the h ousing sector remains far 
below its peak in early 2022, reflecting the effects of higher mortgage rates.  Higher 
interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed 
investment.  
The labor market remains very tight.  Over th e past three months, payroll job 
gains have been robust.  The unemployment rate has moved up but remains low.  There 
are some signs that supply and demand in the labor market are coming into better balance, including higher labor force participation, some easing in nominal wage growth, and declining vacancies.  While the jobs- to-workers gap has declined, labor demand still 
substantially exceeds the supply of available workers.  
Inflation , however, remains well above our longer -run goal of 2 percent.  Over the 
12 months ending in May, total personal consumption expenditures ( PCE) prices are 
estimated to have risen 3.9 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories,  - 2 - 
core PCE prices likely rose 4.7 percent.  Inflation has moderated somewhat since the  
middle of last year.  Nonetheless, inflation pressures continue to run high, and the process 
of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go.  
Since early last year, we have raised our policy rate by 5 percentage points.  We 
see the effec ts of our policy tightening on demand in the most interest  rate–sensitive 
sectors of the economy, particularly housing and investment.  It will take time, however, 
for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation.   
The economy is also facing headwinds from tighter credit conditions for 
households and businesses, which are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation.  Tighter credit conditions are a natural result of tighter monetary policy.  But the bank st resses that emerged in March may well lead to a further tightening in credit 
conditions.  The extent of these effects remains uncertain.   
At our last meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided to 
maintain the target range for the federal fu nds rate at 5 to 5¼ percent while continuing 
the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.  We made this decision in light of the distance we have come in tightening policy, the uncertain lags in monetary policy, and the potential headwinds from credit tightening.  As noted in the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections, a strong majority of Committee participants expect that it will be appropriate to raise interest rates two or more times by the end of the year.

When bank stress emer ged in March, we acted in concert with other government 
agencies to address it, enabling the F ederal D eposit I nsurance C orporation to resolve two 
failed banks in a manner that protected all depositors.  We also used our liquidity tools to

make funding avai lable to banks that might need it.  In addition to our discount window, 
we established a new facility under our emergency lending authorities, the Bank Term 
Funding Program.  Our provision of liquidity through these tools supported the stability of the fin ancial system without restricting the use of our monetary policy tools to firm the 
stance of policy as part of our efforts to reduce inflation.  The banking system remains sound and resilient, deposit flows have stabilized, and strains have eased.  
Evoluti on of the S ystem since the Great Recession  
A little more than a decade ago, the Global Financial Crisis required extraordinary 
interventions by governments around the world.  Stabilizing the U.S. financial system required coordinated efforts by all parts of the government, including $700 billion in taxpayer funds to recapitalize banks, a suite of Fed emergency liquidity facilities, as well as government guarantees on bank transaction accounts and money market mutual funds. Despite these efforts, the Great Recession brought misery to countless millions.  
As the c risis slowly receded, authorities in the U .S. and around the world 
implemented a host of reforms.  The goal was to build a system that could withstand severe shocks, including unanticipated ones that might arrive from any direction.  In other words, a financial system that would be a source of strength during stressful periods.  
A key pillar was building resilience in the banking system.  This effort was 
remarkably successful.  Over the course of the decade, capital and liquidity at the largest U.S. banks more than doubled.  We began a program of rigorous annual stress tests to ensure the banking system was capitalized against severe recessions and financial market turmoil.   - 4 - 
The Great Recession also under scored the critical importance of the nonbank 
sector.  Here , too, the authorities have undertaken a number of steps to build resilience, 
although much remains to be done. 
In 2020 the financial system was again tested, facing a truly unprecedented shock 
as the pandemic brought the global economy to a standstill.  Investors scrambled for 
safety and liquidity during the “dash for cash. ”  Financial markets came under extreme 
pressure.  Ultimately, the authorities had to support financial markets again as part o f the 
extremely forceful monetary and fiscal response to the public health emergency.  The banking system, however, was now far more resilient than it had been before  the reforms 
and thus well positioned to absorb the shock.  
We cannot take the resilience of the financial system for granted , however .  The 
multiple shocks we have seen over the past year or so —including the extreme volatility 
in commodity markets following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and, of course, 
surprisingly high and persistent inflation as well as the associated increase in interest rates— stressed a range of bank and nonbank financial institutions.  
Three G eneral O bservations S temming from the R ecent B anking T urmoil   
Given the efforts to build resilience in the banking system over the past decade 
and a half, two  natural question s are, why did Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and two other 
sizable U.S. banks fail this spring , and why did Credit Suisse —a global systemically 
important bank (G -SIB) —require a government -supported rescue acquisition?   We are 
committed to learning the lessons from the U.S. bank failures for our program of supervision and regulation.  I will offer three observations about the events.   - 5 - 
The first observation is that it is very difficult to resist the natural human tendency 
to fight the last war.  In 2008 we saw banks come under stress from outsized credit losses 
and insufficient liquidity.  Such losses appeared possible in the early days of the 2020 crisis, although they ultimately did not materialize.  In our stress tests, we have considered severe stress scenarios that produced losses on banks’ books, including outsized credit losses.  But, of course, SVB ’s vulnerability came not from credit risk,  but 
from excessive interest rate risk exposure and a business model that was vulnerable in ways its management did not fully appreciate, including a hea vy reliance on uninsured 
deposits.  
These events suggest a need to strengthen our supervision and regula tion of 
institutions of the size of SVB.  I look forward to evaluating proposals for such changes and implementing them where appropriate.
2  Much will depend on getting the specifics 
right, and we should bear in mind that there are always tradeoffs in any financial 
regulation.  In addition, the U .S. has benefited from its rich, multi -tiered banking 
ecosystem , and that diversity should be preserved.  
The second observation is the value of forthrightly recognizing when a crisis is 
building and responding dec isively.  When SVB failed it was clear that a number of 
standard assumptions, even though they were informed by hard experience, were wrong.  
Notably, bank runs were no longer a matter of days or weeks —they could now be nearly 
instantaneous.  Fortunately, in concert with other parts of the government, we were able 
to act decisively to meet the liquidity needs of the banking system, protect depositors , and 
limit contagion.  
 
2 Of course, any rule change will go through the standard rulemaking process, including public notice and 
comment, and have appropriate phase -in and transition periods.   - 6 - 
The third observation is the value of having the very largest banks be highly 
resilien t.  Our regulatory system is much stronger for the substantial additional 
safeguards we have built around the G -SIBs since the Great Recession.  They are subject 
to capital surcharges, required to be highly liquid, and held to the highest supervisory 
stand ards.  The events of the past couple of months would have been much more difficult 
to manage had the largest banks been undercapitalized or illiquid.  Conclusion 
The Great Recession was a watershed moment, demonstrating the terrible 
consequences a fragile financial system  can have on people’s lives .  In response, 
regulators in the U .S. and around the globe set out to build a much more resilient 
financial system.  And the ensuing experiences of the pandemic and the past few months did much to validate this a pproach.  
The bank runs and failures in 2023, however, were painful reminders that we 
cannot predict all of the stresses that will inevitably come with time and chance.  We therefore must not grow complacent about the financial system’s resilience.  And building and maintaining that resilience requires collaboration.  The system was able to 
withstand recent shocks because of the efforts by regulators and legislators, including  
our international counterparts in the  globally interconnected financial system.  
We will take these lessons on board , and we will keep learning, as we must, 
because the work of building and maintaining a resilient financial system is never done. ",2023-06-29,powell

Financial Stabilization and Macroeconomic Stabilization:  
Two Tools for Two Problems  
    
Remarks by  
 
Christopher J. Waller  
 
Member    
 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  
 
at the 
 
Grayba r National Training Conference  
      
San Antonio, Texas  
         
April 14, 2023 
  
Thank you, Kathy, it’s a pleasure to be with you today.  I am going to focus my 
remarks on the economic outlook, including how the recent turmoil in banking has 
affected that outlook.1  Relative to the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) 
economic objectives, data for the first quarter indicate that e conom ic output and 
employment are continuing t o grow at a solid pace while inflation remains much too 
high.  The FOMC raised its target range for the federal funds rate to 4¾ to 5 percent at its 
March meeting , and our statement noted that recent banking developments are likely to 
result in tighter cre dit conditions and to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation.  
We didn’t know then, and still don’t know , the extent of these possible effects.  So, 
perhaps even more closely than usual, I will be watching the data to evaluate the appropriate pa th of monetary policy. 
The sudden failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank, which 
contributed to stresses felt by other mid- size banks, was a classic bank run, in which the 
rapid withdrawal of funds by depositors created severe liquidity pro blems .  SVB was a 
specialty bank serving the tech sector.  Unlike other banks, where a substantial share of 
deposits is  insured and verifiably safe, more than 90 percent of SVB’s deposits were 
above the $250,000- per-account limit for deposit insurance.  Ad ditionally, those deposits 
were largely from many of the same types of businesses, resulting in additional risk.  Chair Powell has directed Vice Chair for Supervision Barr to report by May 1 on SVB’s failure, including the  Federal Reserve’s supervision and regulation of the bank.  Based on 
what is already in the public record, SVB seems to have done a terrible job managing its risks.   
 
1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve 
Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.   - 2 - 
 A bank run that undermine s confidence in other banks  is the most fundamental 
risk to the financial system, and the Fed, serving as the lender of last resort, was created 
in part to prevent such a development.  The job of the lender of last resort is to provide sufficient funds to the banking system so that depositors can be confident  they will be 
able to withdraw their funds on demand.  If depositors are confident that they will be able to withdraw their funds, then a bank run will stop or never start in the first place.  Last month, that confidence was fractur ed when the failures of SVB and Signature Bank 
raised the possibility that uninsured depositors could take significant losses.  As fear of taking those losses spread to uninsured depositors at healthy institutions, it became imperative for the Federal Reserve, along with other regulators, to act.  
The Fed’s long- time liquidity tool is the discount window, by which banks can 
post collateral, priced at market value, and obtain loans for up to 90 days.  On March 12, the Fed created an additional lending tool, w ith the approval of the Secretary of the 
Treasury, called the Bank Term Funding Program  (BTFP) , which accepts U.S. 
government securities collateral at par value with no haircuts for loans with maturities up to a year.  To date, both tools are working well at providing needed liquidity to help banks deal with deposit outflows.  In addition, the Board, the F ederal D eposit I nsurance 
Corporation, and the Treasury Department announced the use of the systemic risk 
exception with respect to both SVB and Signature Bank to fully protect all depositors.  I voted for these actions , not because SVB and Signature are systemically important on 
their own, but to stem the emerging crisis of confidence which could have led to additional bank runs with significant adverse eff ects on financial markets and the broader 
economy.    - 3 - 
The BTFP and discount window appear to have been successful in providing 
stability to the banking system.  In the past  few weeks, we have seen deposit flows 
stabilize across banks and, as a result, the combined usage of the discount window and 
the new program has moderated.  Both tools remain ready and able to provide liquidity, enabl ing banks to support households and businesses.   
This success allowed us to focus on our macroeconomic objectives of price 
stability and maximum employment when setting the policy rate at our March FOMC meeting.  Against this backdrop, the FOMC raised the policy rate 25 basis points without causing significant stress to the financial system.  To date, that decision has been validated.  
That said, it is unclear to what extent the stress in the banking system will weigh 
on economic activity.  If banks feel they need to adjust their business models or are uncertain about the stability of their deposit base or the momentum of the economy, they may tighten credit conditions and curtail lending.  Tighter financial conditions or other lending conditions would likely cause households to reduce spending and businesses to pull back on investment and hiring, all of which will help move supply and demand back into better balance and help bring inflation down toward our 2 percent target.   
It is important to note that there were indications of tightening credit conditions 
this year before the problems emerged in the banking system.  In the Board’s  January 
senior loan officer opinion survey, bank officials reported higher interest rates for loans and tighter lending standards , relative to the end of  last year.
2  These loan officers also 
said they expected to continue tightening lending standards over the course of 2023.  
 
2 One can find the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices at the following link.   
https://www.federalreserve.gov/data/sloos.htm    - 4 - 
They cited an expected deterioration in collateral value, a reduction in risk tolerance, and 
a deterioration in the credit quality of bank portfolios, which mirror the factors that contributed to the recent turmoil in banking.  The failure of SVB and Signature Bank  and 
related developments might have solidified and pulled forward factors that were already working to tighten lending conditions , or it may be that credit conditions will now be 
even tighter than they were on track to be.  
I say this because, all else equal, a significant tightening of credit conditions could 
obviate the need for some additional monetary policy tightening, but making such a judgement is difficult, especially in real time.
3   
Regarding the economic outlook, the data in hand for the first quarter of 2023 
continue to surprise me , with stronger growth and job creation tha n I expected late last 
year.  The FOMC has significantl y raised the target range for the federal funds rate to 
dampen aggregate demand, but U.S. consumers  and businesses are showing remarkable 
resilience.  The Atlanta Fed’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth tracker, which reflects the most up -to-date data, estimate s that gross domestic product grew by 2.2 
percent in the first quarte r, in line with many private sector estimates  and higher than 
most estimates of potential growth provided by FOMC participants.  This growth would 
mean that, so far, tighter monetary policy and credit  conditions are not doing much to 
restrain aggregate demand.   
 Some data for March point to moderation in economic act ivity.   The Institute for 
Supply Management’s (ISM) survey of purchasing managers indicated that 
 
3 For a given level of tightening in various financial market data , estimates of the equivalence in tightening 
of the policy rate vary widely, and,  as the shift in financial conditions since early March showed, financial 
conditions themselves are a moving target.   - 5 - 
manufacturing contracted in March, and the ISM’s survey related to non- manufacturing 
indicated that activity outside the manufacturing sector decelerated in March to a modest 
pace.  Just a few minutes ago  data on retail sales for March was relea sed, which will give 
us some idea of how consumer demand is holding up.  For this and other sectors of the economy, I believe that demand will moderate because of  higher interest rates.  
The solid performance of the economy through the first quarter in part reflects the 
tight labor market.  The jobs report for March showed, once again, that we have a strong labor market , with 236,000 jobs created and the unemployment rate f alling to 3.5 percent .  
While still showing strong signs of growth, job creation did cool a bit from the hot readings we got in January and February.  And we did get some encouraging news that 
the labor market is rebalancing.  First, the labor participation rate increased for the fourth month in a row , so labor supply is slowly increasing.  Second , the report on February job 
openings showed that job vacancie s fell 632,000 to 9.9 million and the vacancy rate 
declined to 6 percent .  Job vacancies have fallen 14  percent  since the peak in March 
2022.  The job openings data along with the jobs report show that labor demand has been falling , which is more evident i n declining vacancies than in rising  layoffs.   So as the 
labor market continues to rebalance this should help bring inflation down by reducing wage pressures.  
Now, let’s talk about what th ese developments  mean for inflation.  Inflation 
moderated in the sec ond half of 2022, but that progress more or less stalled toward the 
end of the year, and inflation remains  far above the FOMC’s target of 2 percent.  On 
April 12, we got consumer price index (CPI) inflation data for March, and it was another month of mixed news.  Overall CPI inflation rose very little with only a 0.05 percent  - 6 - 
increase from the previous month, due to sharp declines in food and energy prices, with 
the year over year increase falling to 5 percent.  Core inflation, which strips out food and energy prices, is a good guide to future inflation, and that measure came in at around 0.4 
percent in March, which translates to an annual rate of 4.6 percent if it were to persist.  It was the fourth month in a row with core inflation at 0.4 percent or highe r.  Since 
December of 2021, core inflation has basically moved sideways with no apparent downward movement.  So, despite some encouraging news on a slowing in housing costs, core inflation does not show much improvement and remains far above our 2 percent inflation target.  
Whether you measure inflation using the CPI or the Fed’s  preferred measure of 
personal c onsumption e xpenditures , it is still much too high and so my  job is not done.  I 
interpret these data as indicating that we haven’t made much progress on our inflation goal, which leaves me at about the same place on the economic outlook that I was at the 
last FOMC meeting , and on the same path for monetary policy.  Because financial  
conditions have not significantly tightened, the labor market continues to be strong and quite tight, and inflation is far above target, so monetary policy needs to be  tightened 
further.  How much further will depend on incoming data on inflation, the rea l economy, 
and the extent of tightening credit conditions. 
Another implication from my outlook and the slow progress lately is that , as of 
now, monetary policy will need to remain tight for a substantial period of time , and 
longer than markets anticipate .  But there are still more than two weeks until the next 
FOMC meeting, and I stand ready to adjust my stance based on what we learn about the economy, including about lending conditions .  Other data such as th ose on the housing  - 7 - 
sector , personal income , and surveys that provide managers ’ views of economic 
conditions in April  will come in over the next few weeks.  I would welcome signs of 
moderating demand, but until they appear  and I see inflation moving meaningfully and 
persistently down toward our 2 percent  target , I believe there is still work to do. 
Thank you, Kathy, and I’m happy to take a few questions.  ",2023-04-14,waller

Perspective s on Inequality and Opportunity from the Survey of Consumer Finances

The distribution of income and wealth in the United States has been widening 
more or less steadily for several decades, to a greater extent than in most advanced  
countries.1  This trend paused during the Great Recession because of  larger wealth losses 
for those at the top of the distribution and because increased safety -net spending  helped 
offset some income losses  for those below the top .  But w idening inequality resumed in 
the recovery, as the stock market re bounded , wage growth and the healing of the labor 
market have been slow, and the increase  in ho me prices has not fully restore d the housing 
wealth lost by the large majority of households for which it is their primary asset.   
The extent of and continuing increase in inequality in the United Sta tes greatly 
concern me.  The past several decades have seen the most sustained  rise in inequality 
since the 19 th century  after more than 40 years of narrowing inequality following the 
Great Depression.   By some estimates , income and wealth inequality are near their 
highest levels in the past hundred years , much higher than the average during that time  
span and probably higher than for much of American history  before then .2  It is no secret 
that the past few decades of widening inequality can be summed up as significant income 
and wealth gains for those at the very top and stagnant living standards for the majority .  I 
think it is appropriate to ask whether th is trend is compat ible with values rooted in our

nation’s  history , among them the high value Americans have traditionally place d on 
equality of opportunity.   
Some degree of inequality in income and wealth , of course, would occur even 
with completely equal opportunity becau se variations in effort, skill, and luck will 
produce variations in outcomes .  Indeed, some variation  in outcomes arguably contributes 
to economic growth because it creates incentives to work hard, get an education, save, 
invest, and undertake risk .  Howev er, to the extent that opportunity itself is enhanced by 
access to economic resources, inequality of outcomes can exacerbate inequality of 
opportunity , thereby perpetuat ing a trend of increasing inequality.   Such a link is 
suggested by the “Great Gatsby Curve,” the finding that , among advanced economies , 
greater income inequality is associated with diminished intergenerational mobility .3  In 
such circumstances, society face s difficult questions of how best to fairly and justly 
promote equal  opportunity.   My purpose today is not to provide answers to these 
contentious questions, but rather to provide a factual basis for further discussion.  I am 
pleased that this conference will focus on equality of economic opportunity  and on ways 
to better promote it .  
In my remarks, I will review trends in income and wealth inequality over the past 
several decades, then identify and discuss four sources of economic opportunity in 
America --think of them as “building blocks” for the gains in income and wealth that most 
Amer icans hope are within reach of those who strive for them.  The first two are widely 
recognized as important sources of opportunity :  resources available for children and 
                                                 
3 See Alan B. Krueger (2012), “The Rise and Consequences of Inequality in the United States,” speech 
delivered at the Center for American Progress, Washington, January 12,

affordable higher education .  The second two may come as more of a surprise:   business  
ownership and  inheritances.   Like most sources of wealth, family ownership of 
businesses and inheritances are concentrated among households at the top of the 
distribution.  But both of these ar e less concentrated and more broadly distributed tha n 
other forms of wealth , and there is some basis for thinking that they may also play a role 
in providing economic opportunities to a considerable number of families below the top .   
In focusing on these four  building blocks , I do not mean to suggest that t hey 
account for all economic opportunity, but I do believe they are all significant sources of 
opportunity for individuals and their families to improve their economic circumstances.  
Income and Wealth Inequality in the Survey of Consumer Finances  
I will start with the basics about widening inequality, drawing heavily on a trove 
of data generated by the Federal Reserve’s triennial Survey of Consumer Finances  (SCF) , 
the latest of which was conducted in 2013 and published last month.4  The SCF is broadly 
consistent with other data that show widening wealth and income inequality over the past 
several decades, but I am employing the SCF because it offers the added advantage of 
specific detail on income, wealth , and debt for each of 6,000 households surveyed.5  This 
detail from family balance sheets provides a glimpse of the relative access to the four 
sources of opportunity I will discuss . 
                                                 
4 Asset questions in the SCF are based on the value at the time of the survey.   Since most interviews were 
completed between April and December 2013, some of the asset values do not reflect price increases 
experienced in late 2013, and none reflect increase s in 2014.  Income questions in the SCF refer to the prior 
calendar year, so the 2013 survey reports 2012 income.   See Jesse Bricker, Lisa J. Dettling, Alice 
Henriques, Joanne W. Hsu, Kevin B. Moore, John Sabelhaus, Jeffrey Thompson, and Richard A. Windle 
(2014), “Changes in U.S. Family Finances from 2010 to 2013:  Evidence from the Survey of Consumer 
Finances,” Federal Reserve Bulletin, vol. 100 (September), pp. 1 -41, 
www .federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/2014/articles/scf/scf.htm .   
5 “Households” and “families” are used interchangeably in these remarks because the SCF uses both 
interchangeably to describe its respondents.   - 4 - 
 
While the recent trend of widening income and wealth inequality is clear,  the 
implications for a particular family partly depend on whether that family’s living 
standards are ri sing or not  as its relative position changes.   There have been some times 
of relative prosperity when income has grown for most households but inequality 
widened because the gains were proportionally l arger for those at the top ; widening 
inequality might not be as great a concern if living standards improv e for most families.  
That was the case for much of the 1990s, when real income s were rising for most 
households.  At other times, however, inequality  has widened because  income and wealth 
grew for those at the top and stagnate d or fell for  others.  And a t still other times, 
inequality has widened when incomes were falling for most households, but the declines  
toward the bottom were proportionally large r.  Unfortunately, the past several decades of  
widening inequality has often involved stagnant or falling living standards for m any 
families.  
Since the survey began in its current form in 1989, the SCF has show n a rise in 
the concentrat ion of income in the top few percent of households , as shown in figure 1.6 
By definition, of course, the share of all income held by the rest, the vast majority of 
households, has fallen by the same amount .7  This concentration was the result of i ncome 
and living standard s rising much more quickly  for those at the top .  After adjusting for 
                                                 
6 The share of income that went to the top 5 perc ent of households --a threshold of $230,000 in gross 
income in 2013 --rose from 31 percent of income reported by all respondents in 1989 to 37 percent in 2007.  
The income share for this group fell in the financial crisis, to 34 percent in 2010, then rose in  the recovery, 
regaining a 37 percent share in 2013 . 
7 The top half of the distribution, except for the top 5 percent, earned 53 percent of all income in 1989 but 
only 51 percent in 2010. In 2013, households in the  “next 45 percent” had incomes  between $47 ,000 and 
$230,000.   While income has rebounded for the top 5 percent in the recovery, the share that went to the  
next 45 percent declined further to 49 percent in 2013.  The bottom half of the distribution  saw their share 
of income fall from 16 percent in 1989 to 15 percent in 2007, edge up in  2010, and then reach a new low  
for the survey last year at 14  percent.  - 5 - 
 
inflation, the average income of the top 5 percent of households grew by 38 percent from 
1989 to 2013 , as we can see in figure 2 .  By comparison, the average real income of the 
other  95 percent of households  grew less than 10 percent .  Income inequality narrowed 
slightly during the Great R ecession , as income fell more for the top than for others, but 
resumed widening in the recovery , and by 2013 it had nearly return ed to the pre -recession 
peak.8  
The distribution of wealth is even more unequal than that of income, and the SCF 
shows that wealth inequality has increased  more than income inequality  since 1989 .  As 
shown in figure 3, t he wealthiest 5 percent of American ho useholds held 54 percent of all 
wealth reported in the 1989  survey .  Their share rose to 61 percent in 2010 and reached 
63 percent in 2013.  By contrast, the rest of those in the top half of the wealth 
distribution --families that in 2013 had a net worth between  $81,000 and $1.9 million --
held 43  percent of wealth in 1989 and  only 36 percent in 2013.  
The lower half of households by wealth held just 3 percent of wealth in 1989 and 
only 1 percent in 2013 .  To put that in perspective, figure 4 shows that the average  net 
worth of the lower half  of the distribution , representing 62 million households, was 
$11,000 in 2013.9  About one-fourth  of these families reported zero wealth or negative 
net worth, and a significant fraction of th ose said they were “underwate r” on their home 
mortgages , owing more than the value of the home .10  This $11,000  average is 50 percent 
                                                 
8 Largely because of  losses in income from financial holdings, the share of total income received by the top 
5 percent of households fell 3 percen tage points from 2007 to 2010, with the next 45 percent and lower half 
of households each gaining about half of that share.   Some of the nominal income losses for households 
below the top 5 percent were offset by larger -than-normal transfer payments during  the recession.  
9 All SCF income and wealth data prior to the 2013 survey are adjusted for inflation by expressing the 
values in 2013 dollars.  
10 In the 2013 SCF, 17 percent of all families reporting zero or negative net worth also reported they were 
under water on their home mortgages.

lower than the average wealth of the lower half of families in 1989, adjusted for  inflation .  
Average real wealth rose gradually for th ese families for most of those years,  then 
dropped sharply after 2007.   Figure 5 shows that average wealth also grew steadily for 
the “next 45” percent of households before the crisis but didn’t fall nearly as much 
afterward .  Those next 45  households saw their wealth , measured in 2013 dollars,  grow 
from an average of $323,000 in 1989 to $516,000 in 2007 and then fall to $424,000 in 
2013, a net gain of about one-third over 24 years.   Meanwhile,  the average real w ealth of 
families in the top 5 percent  has nearly d ouble d, on net --from $3.6 million  in 1989 to 
$6.8 million  in 2013 .  
Housing  wealth --the net equity held by households , consisting  of the value of 
their home s minus their mortgage debt --is the most important source of wealth for all but 
those at the very top.11  It accounted for three -fifths of wealth in 2013 for the lower half 
of families  and two-fifths  of wealth for the next 45.   But housing wealth was only one-
fifth of total wealth for the top 5 percent of families .  The share  of housing in total net  
worth for all three groups has not changed much since  1989.   
Since housing accounts for a larger share of wealth for those in the bottom half of 
the wealth distribution, their overall wealth is affected more by changes in home prices.  
Furthermore, homeowners in  the bottom half have been  more highly leveraged on their 
homes, amplifying this difference.  As a result, while the SCF shows that all three groups 
saw proportionally similar increases and subsequent declines in home prices from 1989 to 
2013, the effects on net worth were greater for those in the bottom half of households by 
wealth.  Foreclosure s and the dramatic fall in hous e prices  affected many of these 
                                                 
11 Housing wealth includes the net equity in primary residences and other residential real estate.  - 7 - 
 
families severely,  push ing them w ell down the wealth distribution .  Figure 6 shows that 
homeowners in  the bottom half of households by wealth reported 61 percent less home 
equity in 2013 than in 2007.   The next 45 reported a 29 percent loss of housing wealth, 
and the top 5 lost 20 percent.  
Fortunately, r ebounding housing prices in 2013 and 2014 have restored a good 
deal of the loss in housing wealth, with the largest gains for those toward the bottom.   
Based on rising home prices alone and not counting possible changes in mortgage debt  or 
other factors , Federal Reserve staff estimate that between 2013 and mid -2014 , average 
home equity  rose 49  percent for the lowest  half of families  by wealth  that own homes .12  
The estimated gains are  somewhat less for those with greater wealth .13  Homeowners in 
the bottom 50 , which had an average overall net worth of $25,000  in 2013 , would have 
seen their net worth increase to  an average of  $33,000 due solely to home price gains 
since 2013, a 32 percent increase.   
Another major source of wealth for many families is financi al assets, including 
stocks, bonds, mutual funds , and private pensions .14  Figure 7 show s that t he wealthiest  
5 percent of households held nearly two -thirds of all s uch assets in 2013, the next 
45 percent of families held about one-third, and the bottom half of households , just  
2 percent.  This figure may look familiar, since t he distribution of financial wealth has 
                                                 
12 The house price data used are from CoreLogic, and data track price changes at the Core Based Statistical 
Area level between  the survey month in 2013 and June 2014.  The average increase in home prices over 
this period was 8 percent.  No adjustments are made to account for possible changes in mortgage leverage . 
13 Home price gains in 2013 and 2014 are estimated to have raised th e home equity of home -owning 
households in the next 45 percent  of households in the wealth distribution by 12 percent, and by 9 percent 
for home -owning households in the top 5 percent of the wealth distribution.  
14 The SCF defines financial assets as liquid  assets, certificates of deposit, directly held pooled investment 
funds, stocks, bonds, quasi -liquid assets (including retirement accounts), savings bonds, whole life 
insurance, other managed assets, and other financial assets.   - 8 - 
 
concentrated at the top since 1989 at rates similar to those for overall wealth , which we 
saw in figure  3.15 
Those are the basics on wealth and inc ome inequality from the SCF.  Other 
research tells us that inequality tends to persist from one generation to the next.  For 
example, o ne study th at divides households by income found that 4 in 10 children raised 
in families in the lowest -income  fifth of h ouseholds remain in that quintile as adults.16  
Fewer than 1 in 10 children of families at the bottom later reach the top quintile.  The 
story is flipped for children raised in the highest -income  households :  When they grow 
up, 4 in 10 stay at the top and fewer than 1 in 10 fall to the bottom .   
Research also indicates that economic mobility in the United States has not 
changed much in the last several decades ; that mobility is lower in the United States than 
in most other advanced  count ries; and, as I noted earlier, that economic mobility and 
income inequality among advanced countries are negatively correlated .17  
Four Building Blocks of Opportunity  
An important factor influencing intergenerational mobility and trends in 
inequality over t ime is economic opportunity.  While we can measure overall mobility 
                                                 
15 In 1989, the top 5 percen t of households held 54 percent of financial assets, the next 45 percent (that is, 
home -owning households in the 50th through 95th percentiles of the wealth distribution ) held 42 percent, 
and the bottom half held 4 percent.

and inequality, summarizing opportunity is harder, which is why I intend to focus on 
some important sources of opportunity --the four building blocks I mentioned earlier.   
Two of those are  so significant that you might call them “cornerstones” of 
opportunity, and you will not be surprised to hear that both are largely related to 
education.  The first of these cornerstones I would describe more fully as “resources 
available to children in th eir most formative years.”  The second is higher  education that 
students  and their families can afford.  
Two ad ditional sources of opportunity  are evident in  the SCF .  They affect fewer 
families than the two cornerstones I have just identified , but enough families  and to a 
sufficient extent that I believe they are also important  sources of economic opportunity . 
The third building block  of opportunity , as shown by the SCF, is  ownership of a 
private business.18  This usually means ownership and sometimes direc t management of a 
family business.  The fourth source of opportunity is inherited wealth.  As one would 
expect, inheritances are concentrated among the wealthiest families , but the SCF 
indicates they may also play an important role in the opportunities ava ilable to other s. 
Resources Available for Children  
For households  with children, family resources can pay for things that  research 
shows  enhance future earnings and other economic outcomes --homes in safe r 
neighborhoods with good schools, for example, better nutrition and health care, early 
childhood education , intervention for learning disabilities , travel and other potentially 
                                                 
18 Business assets in the SCF include both actively and “non -actively” managed busi nesses but do not 
include ownership of publicly traded stock.  - 10 - 
 
enriching experiences.19  Affluent families have significant resources for things that give 
children economic advantages as adults, and the SCF data I have cited indicate that many 
other households have very little to spare for this purpose.  These disparities extend to 
other household characteristics associated with better economic outcomes for offspring, 
such as homeownership rates, educational attainment of parents, and a stable family 
structure.20   
According to the SCF, t he gap  in wealth between  families with children at the 
bottom and the top of the distribution has been growing steadily over the past 24 years , 
but that pace has accelerated recently.   Figure 8 shows that t he median wealth for families 
with children in the lower half of the wealth distribution f ell from $ 13,000 in 2007 to 
$8,000 in 2013, after  adjusting for  inflation , a loss of 40 percent.21  Thes e wealth levels 
look small  alongside the much higher wealth of the next 45 percent of households with 
children .  But t hese families also saw their median wealth fall dramatically --by one-third

Five,” ch. 15 in David Card and Orley Ashenfelter, eds. , Handbook of Labor Economics , vol. 4 (Holland:  
Elsevier ), pp. 1315 -1486 . 
20 Homeownership by parents is strongly associated with economic success for children; see Thomas P. 
Boehm and Alan M. Schlottmann (1999), “Does Home Ownership by Parents Have an Economic Impact 
on Their Children?” Journal  of Housing Economics,  vol. 8 (September), pp. 217 -32, 
www.researchgate.net/publication/223016312_Does_Home_Ownership _by_Parents_Have_an_Economic_
Impact_on_Their_Children .  Ninety -seven percent of top -earning families with children own a home, 
compared with fewer than half of the bottom 50  percent of families with children ; educational attainment of 
parents is strongly p redictive of outcomes for children that determine earnings.  See Ayana Douglas -Hall 
and Michelle Chau (2007), “Parents’ Low Education Leads to Low Income, Despite Full -Time 
Employment” (New York:  National Center for Children in Poverty, Columbia Universit y, November), 
www.nccp.org/publications/pub_786.html .  A considerable body of literature establishes the correlation 
between educational attainment of parents and their children.  Other research  has identified that this 
relationship is causal ; see, for example, Philip Oreopoulos, Marianne E. Page , and Ann Huff Stevens  
(2006),  “The Intergenerational Effects of Compulsory Schooling, ” Journal of Labor Economics,  vol. 24 
(October), pp. 729-60.  Eight y-six percent of top -earning households in the SCF with children are headed 
by a college graduate, compared with 12 percent in the bottom half of households with children ; children 
raised by a single parent earn less as adults.  See Mary Ann Powell and Tob y L. Parcel (1997), “Effects of 
Family Structure on the Earnings Attainment Process:  Differences by Gender,” Journal of Marriage and 
Family,  vol. 59 (May), pp. 419 -33.  Only 4 percent of top -earning households with children are headed by 
unmarried parents , compared with 47 percent for the lower half of households with children .

in real terms --from $344,000  in 2007 to $229,000  in 2013 .  The top 5 percent of families 
with children saw their median wealth fall only 9 percent, from $3.5 million  in 2007 to 
$3.2 million  in 2013 , after infla tion. 
For families below the top, public funding plays an important role in providing 
resources to childre n that influence future levels of income and wealth.  Such funding has 
the potential to help equalize these resources  and the opportunit ies they confer . 
Social safety -net spending is an important form of public funding that help s offset  
disparities in fami ly resources for children .  Spending for income security programs since 
1989 and until recently was fairly stable, ranging between 1.2 and 1.7 percent of gross 
domestic product (GDP) , with higher levels in this range related to recessions.  However, 
such s pending rose to 2.4 percent of GDP in 2009 and 3 percent in 2010.22  Researchers 
estimate that the increase in the poverty rate because of  the recession would have been 
much  larger without the effects of income security programs.23  
Public fund ing of education is another way that governments can help offset the 
advantages some households have in resources available for children.  One of the most 
consequential examples is early childhood education.  Research shows that children from 
lower -income households who get good -quality pre -Kindergarten education are more 
likely to graduate from high school and attend college  as well as  hold a job and have 
higher earnings, and they are less likely to be incarcerated or receive public assistance.24

Figure 9 shows that a ccess to quality early childhood education has improved  since the 
1990s, but it remains limited --41 percent of children were enrolled in state or federally 
supported programs in 2013.  Gains in enrollment have stalled since 2010, as has growth 
in funding, in both cases because of  budget cuts related to the Great Recession.  These 
cuts have reduced per -pupil spending in state -funded programs by 12 percent  after 
inflation , and access to such programs, most of which are limited to lower -income 
families, varies considerably from state to state and within states, since local funding is 
often important.25  In 20 10, the United States ranked 28th out of 38 advanced  countries in 
the share of four-year-olds enrolled in public or private early childhood education.26 
Similarly, the quality and the funding levels of public education at the primary 
and secondary level s vary widely , and this unevenness limits public education’s  
equalizing effect.   The United States is one of the few advanced economies in which  
public education spending is often lower for students in lower -income households than 
for students in higher -income households.27  Some countries strive for more or less equal 
funding , and others actually require higher funding in schools serving students from

lower -income families, expressly for the purpose of reducing  inequality in resources for 
children.   
A major reason the United States is different is that we are one of the few 
advanced nation s that funds primary and secondary public education mainly  through 
subnational taxation.  Half of U.S. public school funding comes from local property 
taxes, a much higher share than in other advanced c ountries, and thus the inequalities in 
housing wealth and income I have described enhance the ability of more -affluent school 
districts to spend more on public schools.  Some states have acted to equalize spending to 
some extent in recent years, but there is still significant variation among and within 
states.  Even after adjusting for regional differences in costs a nd student needs, there is 
wide variation in public school funding in the United States.28 
Spending is not the only determinant of outcomes in public education.  Research 
shows that higher -quality teachers raise the educational attainment and the future 
earnings of students.29  Better -quality teachers can help equalize some of the 
disadvantages in opportunity faced by students from lower -income households, but here , 
too, there are forces that work against raising teacher quality for these students.  Research 
shows that , for a variety of reasons, including inequality in teacher pay, the best teachers 
tend to migrate to and concentrate in schools in higher -income areas.30  Even within

teachers to migrate to schools and to classrooms with more -advantaged students.31 
Higher Education that Families  Can Afford  
For many individuals and families , high er education is the other cornerstone of 
economic opportunity.  The premium in lifetime earnings because of  higher education 
has increased over the p ast few decades , reflecting greater demand for college -educated 
workers.   By one measure, the median annual  earnings of full -time workers with a four -
year bachelor’s degree are 79 percent  higher than the median for those with only a high 
school diploma.32  The wage premium for a graduate degree is significantly higher  than 
the premium for a college degree .  Despite escalating costs for college, t he net returns for 
a degree are high  enough that college still offers a considerable economic opportunity to 
most people .33

31 Better and more -experienced teachers tend to move to better -resourced schools, including those with 
more  active outside funding, or those with more -advantaged students, such as magnet schools.   Even within 
schools, more experienced and higher performing teachers are more likely to teach Advanced Placement 
classes which tend to serve more advantaged students.   The result is that lower income and lower achieving 
students are more likely to be taught by less experienced and lower performing teachers.  See Charles

Along with other data, the SCF shows that most students and their families are 
having a harde r time affording college.  College costs have risen much faster than income 
for the large majority of households since 2001 and have become especially burdensome 
for households in the bottom hal f of the earnings distribution.  
Rising college costs, the grea ter numbers of students pursuing higher education, 
and the recent trends in income and wealth have led to a dramatic increase in student loan 
debt.  Outstanding student loan debt quadrupled from $260 billion in 2004  to $1.1 trillion 
this year .  Sorting fam ilies by  wealth , the SCF shows that the relative burden  of education 
debt has long been higher for families with lower net worth , and that this disparity has 
grown much wider in the past couple decades.  Figure 10  show s that from 1 995 to 2013, 
outstanding education debt grew from 26 percent of average yearly income for the lower 
half of households to 58 percent of income.34  The education debt burden was lower and 
grew a little less sharply for the next 45 percent of families and was much lower and 
grew not at all for the top 5 percent.35 
Higher education has been and remains a potent source of ec onomic opportunity 
in America , but I fear the large and growing burden of paying for it may make it harder 
for many young people to take advantage of the opportunity higher education  offers .  
Opportunities to Build Wealth through Business Ownership  
For many people , the opportunity to build a business has long been an important 
part of the American dream.  In addition to housing and financial assets , the SCF shows 
                                                 
15 percent.  See Jaison R. Abel and Richard Deitz (2014), “Do the Benefits of College Still Outweigh the 
Costs?” Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Current Issues in Economics and Finance , vol. 20 (3), 
www.newyorkfed.org/research/current_issues/ci20 -3.pdf . 
34 Education debt in the SCF reflects the total amount of debt outstanding at the time of the survey.

income.  Numbers are for families with education debt.  - 16 - 
 
that ownership of private businesses is a significant source of wealth and can be  a vital 
source of opportunity for many households to improve their economic circumstances and 
position  in the wealth distribution . 
While business wealth is highly concentrated at the top of the distribution , it also  
represents a significant component  of wealth for some other  household s. 36  Figure 1 1 
shows  that slightly more than h alf of the top 5 percent of households have a share in a 
private business .  The average value of these holdings is nearly $4 million.  Only 
14 percent  of families in the next 45 have ownership  in a private business, but for those 
that do, this type of wealth  constitutes  a substantial portion of their assets --the average 
amount of th is busines s equity is nearly $200,000, representing more than one-third of 
their net worth.  Only 3 percent of the bottom half of households h old equity in a private 
business, but it is a big share  of wealth for those few.37  The average amount of this 
wealth is clos e to $20,000, 60 percent of the average net worth for these households.38  
Owning a business is risky, and most new businesses close within a few years . 
But research shows that business ownership is associated with higher levels of economic 
mobility.39  However, it appears that it has become harder to start and build businesses.  
The pace of new business creation has gradually declined over the past couple of 
                                                 
36 The SCF does not ask households whether they started businesses that closed, so reported business 
ownership and wealth is largely related only to those bu sinesses that succeed.  
37 Distributional statistics for business ownership and assets exclude outliers with large negative net worth.  
38 Business wealth took a big hit due to the recession and has only partly recovered for most families.  For 
the bottom half  of the distribution, the $20,000 average in business wealth in 2013 was down from $29,000, 
after adjusting for inflation, in 2007. The nearly $200,000 held by the next 45 percent with businesses was 
down from $228,000 in 2007.  The $4 million in business wealth of the top 5 percent in 2013 was down, in 
real terms, from $4.4 million in 2007.  
39 See, for  example , Robert Fairlie (2004),  “Earnings Growth among Young Less -Educated Business 
Owners,” Industrial Relations , vol. 43 (July), pp. 634-59; Douglas Holtz -Eakin, Harvey S. Rosen, and 
Robert Weathers (2000 ), “Horatio Alger Meets the Mobility Tables ,” Small Business Economics , vol. 14,

decades , and  the number of new firms declined sharply from 2006 through 2009.40  The 
latest SCF sh ows that the percentage of the next 45 that own a business has fallen to a 25 -
year low, and equity in those businesses, adjusted for inflation, is at its lowest point since 
the mid -1990s.   One reason to be concerned about t he apparent decline in new busine ss 
formation is that it may serve to depress the pace of productivity, real wage growth , and 
employment.41  Another reason is  that a slowdown in business formation may threaten 
what I believe likely has been a significant source of economic opportunity for many 
families  below the very top in income and wealth.   
Inheritances  
Along with other economic advantages , it is likely that large inheritances play a 
role in the fairly limited intergenerational mobility that I described  earlier .42  But 
inheritances are also common among households  below the top of the wealth distribution  
and sizable  enough that I believe they may well play a  role in helping these families 
economically .  
Figure 12 shows  that h alf of the top 5 percent of households by wealth reported 
recei ving an inheritance at some  time, but a considerable number of others did as well --

almost 30 percent of the next 45 percent and 12 percent of the bottom 50.   Inheritances 
are concentrated at the top  of the wealth distribution  but less so than total wealth.   Just 
over h alf of the total value of inheritances went to the top 5  percent and 40 percent went 
to households in the next 45 .  Seven percent of inheritances were shared among 
households in the bottom 50  percent , a group that together held only 1 percent of all 
wealth in 2013 .43   
The average inheritance reported by those in the top 5 percent who had received 
them was $1.1 million .  That amount dwarfs the $183,000 average among the next 
45 percent and the $68,000 reported among the bottom half of households.  But c ompared 
with the typical wealth of these households , the additive effect of bequests of this size is 
significant for the millions of households be low the top 5 that receive them.  
The average age for rece iving an inheritance is 40, when many parents are trying 
to save for and secure the opportunities of higher education for their children, move up to 
a larger home or one in a better neighborhood, launch a business, switch careers , or 
perhaps relocate to se ek more opportunity . Considering the overall picture of limited 
resources for most families that I have described today, I think the effects of inheritances 
for the sizable minority below the top that receive one are likely a significant source of 
economic  opportunity.  
Conclusion  
 In closing, let me say that, with these examples, I have only just touched the 
surface of the important topic of economic opportunity, and I look forward to learning 
                                                 
43 Reported inheritances can have been received at any point in the respondent’s life.  As with other forms 
of wealth cited in these remarks, inheritances have been adjusted for inflation and ar e expressed in 2013 
dollars.

more from the work presented at this conference.  As I noted at the outset, research abou t 
the causes and implications of inequality is ongoing, and I hope that this conference helps 
spur further study of economic opportunity and its effects on economic mobility.  Using 
the SCF and other sources, I have tried to offer some observations about h ow access to 
four specific sources of opportunity may vary across households, but I can not offer any 
conclusions about how much these factors influence income and wealth inequality.  I do 
believe that these are important questions, and I hope that further research will help 
answer them.  Perspectives on Inequality and

Seventeen months have passed since the U.S. economy faced the full fo rce of the 
COVID- 19 pandemic.  This shock led to an immediate and unprecedented decline as 
large parts of the economy were shuttered to contain the spread of the disease.   
The path of recovery has been a difficult one, and a good place to begin is by 
thanking those on the front line fighting the pandemic:  the essential workers who kept 
the economy going, those who have cared for others in need, and those in medical research, business, and government, who came together to discover, produce, and widely distribute effective vaccines in record time.  We should also keep in our thoughts those who have lost their lives from COVID, as well as their loved ones.  
Strong policy support has fueled a vigorous but uneven recovery —one that is , in 
many respects, histo rically anomalous .  In a reversal of typical patterns in a downturn, 
aggregate personal income rose rather than fell, and households massively shifted their 
spending from services to manufactured goods.  Booming demand for goods and the 
strength and speed of the reopening have led to shortages and bottlenecks, leaving the 
COVID- constrained supply side unable to keep up.  The result has been elevated inflation 
in durable goods —a sector that has experienced an annual inflation rate well below zero 
over the pa st quarter century.
1  Labor market conditions are improving but turbulent, and 
the pandemic continues to threaten not only health and life, but also economic activity.  Many other advanced economies are experiencing similarly unusual conditions.  
In my com ments today, I will focus on the Fed’s efforts to promote our maximum 
employment and price stability goals amid this upheaval , and suggest how lessons from 
 
1 See, for example, figure 5.   - 2 - 
history and a careful focus on incoming data and the evolving risks offer useful guidance 
for today’ s unique monetary policy challenges.  
The Recession and Recovery So Far 
The pandemic recession —the briefest yet deepest on record —displaced roughly 
30 million workers in the space of two months.2  The decline in output in the second 
quarter of 2020 was tw ice the full decline during the Great Recession of 2007 –09.3  But 
the pace of the recovery has exceeded expectations, with output surpassing its previous peak after only four quarters, less than half the time required following the Great Recession.  As is typically the case, the recovery in employment has lagged that in output; nonetheless, employment gains have also come faster than expected.
4 
The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least 
able to shoulder the burden have been hardest hit.  In particular, despite progress, joblessness continues to fall disproportionately on lower- wage workers in the service 
sector and on African Americans and Hispanics.  
The unevenness of the recovery can further be seen through the lens of the 
sectoral shift of  spending into goods —particularly durable goods such as appliances, 
furniture, and cars —and away from services, particularly in -person services in areas such 
as travel and leisure (figure 1).  As the pandemic struck, restaurant meals fell 45 percent, air travel 95 percent, and dentist visits 65 percent.  Even today, with overall gross 
 
2 This figure includes both the decline in the number reporting themselves as employed in the Household 
Survey as well as the BLS’ estimate of those who misreported themselves as employed but not at work 
rather than on temporary layoff.  
3 From the peak to the trough quarter, gross domestic product dropped 10 percent last year, compared with 
3.8 percent in the 2007– 09 recession.  
4 For example, the consensus forecast reported by Blue Chip Economic Indicators in April 2020 put the 
unemployment rate in the second quarter of 2021 at 7.4 percent, compared with the actual value of 5.9 percent.   - 3 - 
domestic product and consumption spending more than fully recovered, services 
spending remains about 7 percent below trend.  Total employment is now 6 million below its Februa ry 2020 level, and 5 million of that shortfall is in the still -depressed 
service sector.  In contrast, spending on durable goods has boomed since the start of the recovery and is now running about 20 percent above the pre -pandemic level.  With 
demand outst ripping pandemic -afflicted supply, rising durables prices are a principal 
factor lifting inflation well above our 2 percent objective.  
Given the ongoing upheaval in the economy, some strains and surprises are 
inevitable.  The job of monetary policy is to p romote maximum employment and price 
stability as the economy works through this challenging period.  I will turn now to a discussion of progress toward those goals.  
The Path Ahead:  Maximum Employment  
The outlook for the labor market has brightened conside rably in recent months.  
After faltering last winter, job gains have risen steadily over the course of this year and now average 832,000 over the past three months, of which almost 800,000 have been in services (figure 2).  The pace of  total hiring is faster than at any time  in the recorded data 
before the pandemic.  The levels of job openings and quits are at record highs, and employers report that they cannot fill jobs fast enough to meet returning demand.  
These favorable conditions for job seekers shoul d help the economy cover the 
considerable remaining ground to reach maximum employment.  The unemployment rate has declined to 5.4 percent, a post -pandemic low, but is still much too high, and the 
reported rate understates the amount of labor market slack.
5  Long- term unemployment 
 
5 An alternative measure that adjusts for the misclassification of some unemployed workers as employed 
but not at work (as reported by the Bureau of Labor S tatistics) and for diminished labor force participation  - 4 - 
remains elevated, and the recovery in labor force participation has lagged well behind the 
rest of the labor market, as it has in past recoveries.   
With vaccinations rising, schools reopening, and enhanced unemployment 
benefits ending, some factors  that m ay be  holding back job seekers are likely fading.6  
While the Delta variant presents a near -term risk, the prospects are good for continued 
progress toward maximum employment.  
The Path Ahead:  Inflation  
The rapid reopening of the economy has brought a sharp run -up in inflation.  Over 
the 12 months through July, measures of headline and core personal consumption expenditures inflation have run at 4.2 percent and 3.6 percent, respectively —well above 
our 2 percent longer -run objective.
7  Businesses and consumers widely report upward 
pressure on prices and wages.  Inflation at these levels is, of course, a cause for concern.  But that concern is tempered by a number of factors that suggest that these elevated 
readings are likely to prove temporary.  This asse ssment is a critical and ongoing one, 
and we are carefully monitoring incoming data.   
The dynamics of inflation are complex, and we assess the inflation outlook from a 
number of different perspectives, as I will now discuss.  
 
induced by the pandemic (as estimated by Federal Reserve Board staff) currently stands at 7.8 percent, also 
a post- pandemic low.   
6 Factors holding back job gains are more thoroughly discussed in the July 2021 Monetary Policy Report,  
which is available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/20210709_mprfullreport.pdf . 
7 These values reflect data through July as released on August 27, 2020.  All other statements about 
personal consumption expenditures and associated prices reflect data through June and do not include the August 27, 2021  release covering July.   - 5 - 
1. The absence so far of broad- based inflation pressures  
The spike in inflation is so far largely the product of a relatively narrow group of 
goods and services that have been directly affected by the pandemic and the reopening of 
the economy.  Durable goods alone contributed about 1 percentage point to the latest 12-month measures of headline and core inflation.  Energy prices, which rebounded with 
the strong recovery, added another 0.8 percentage point to headline inflation, and from long experience we expect the inflation effects of these increases to be transitory.  In addition, some prices —for example, for hotel rooms and airplane tickets —declined 
sharply during the recession and have now moved back up close to pre -pandemic levels.  
The 12- month window we use in computing inflation now captures the rebound in prices 
but not the initial decline, temporarily elevating reported inflation.  These effects, which are adding a few tenths to measured inflation, should wash out over time.   
We consult a range of measures meant to capture whet her price increases for 
particular items are spilling over into broad -based inflation.  These include trimmed mean 
measures and measures excluding durables and computed from just before the pandemic.  These measures  generally show inflation at or close to our 2 percent longer -run objective 
(figure 3).  We would be concerned at signs that inflationary pressures were spreading  
more broadly through the economy.   
2. Moderating inflation in higher -inflation items  
We are also directly monitoring the prices of pa rticular goods and services most 
affected by the pandemic and the reopening, and are beginning to see a moderation in 
some cases as shortages ease.  Used car prices, for example,  appear to have stabilized ; 
indeed, some price indicators are beginning to fall.  If that continues, as many analysts  - 6 - 
predict, then used car prices will soon be pulling measured inflation down, as they did for 
much of the past decade.8   
This same dynamic of upward inflation pressure dissip ating and, in some cases, 
reversing seems likely to play out in durables more generally.  Over the 25 years preceding the pandemic, durables prices actually declined, with inflation averaging negative 1.9 percent per year (figure 5).
9  As supply problems have begun to resolve, 
inflation in durable goods other than autos has now slowed and may be starting to fall.  It 
seems unlikely that durables inflation will continue to contribute importantly over time to 
overall inflation.   We will be looking for evidence that supports or undercuts that 
expectation.  
3. Wages  
We also assess whether wage increases are consistent with 2 percent inflation 
over time.  Wage increases are essential to support a rising standard of living and are 
generally, of course, a welcome development.  But if wage increases were to move 
materially and persistently above the levels of productivity gains and inflation, businesses 
would likely pass those increases on to customers, a process that could become the sort of “wage–price spiral” see n at times in the past.
10  Today we see little evidence of wage 
increases that might threaten excessive inflation (figure 6).  Broad -based measures of 
wages that adjust for compositional changes in the labor force, such as the employment 
 
8 Declines in  used car prices would begin holding down 12 -month inflation once most of the earlier price 
increases have fallen out of the 12 -month window.  
9 The lower inflation in durable goods is probably due to a number factors , including faster productivity 
growth i n durable goods than in services and globalization.  
10 If wages rise in line with inflation and labor productivity growth, then real unit labor costs (or the labor 
cost of producing one unit of output) to businesses are constant.  Wages may grow slower or faster than 
inflation plus productivity growth for ext ended periods because of changing structural factors without being 
reflected in inflation.  Ultimately, however, persistently rising real unit labor costs will put upward pressure on prices.       - 7 - 
cost index and the  Atlanta Wage Growth Tracker, show wages moving up at a pace that  
appears consistent with our longer -term inflation objective.  We will continue to monitor 
this carefully.  
4. Longer -term inflation expectations  
Policymakers and analysts generally believe t hat, as long as longer -term inflation 
expectations remain anchored, policy can and should look through temporary swings in 
inflation.  Our monetary policy framework emphasizes that anchoring longer -term 
expectations at 2 percent is important for both maxim um employment and price stability.   
We carefully monitor a wide range of indicators of longer -term inflation 
expectations.  These measures today are at levels broadly consistent with our 2 percent objective (figure 4).  Because measures of inflation expectations are individually noisy, we also focus on common patterns across the measures.  One approach to summarizing these patterns is the Board staff’s index of common inflation expectations (CIE), which 
combines information from a broad range of survey and market- based measures.
11  This 
index captures a general move down in expectations starting around 2014, a time when inflation was running persistently below 2 percent.  More recently, the index shows a welcome reversal of that decline and is now at levels more consistent with our 2 percent objective.   
Longer -term inflation expectations have moved much less than actual inflation or 
near-term expectations, suggesting that households, businesses, and market participants

underlying movements that are unique to individual measures; the CIE will reflect movements that are 
more common across underlying measures .    - 8 - 
also believe that current high inflation readings are likely to prove transitory and that, in 
any case, the Fed will keep inflation close to our 2 percent objective over time.12   
5. The prevalence of global disinflationary forces over the past quarter century  
Finally, it is worth noting  that,  since the 1990s, inflation in many advanced 
economies has run somewhat below 2 percent even in good times (figure 7).  The pattern of low inflation likely reflects sustained disinflationary forces, including technology, 
globalization and perhaps demographic factors, as well as a stronger and more successful 
commitment by central banks to maintain price stability.
13  In the United States, 
unemployment ran below 4 percent for about two years before the pandemic, while inflation ran at or below 2 percent.  Wages did move up across the income spectrum —a 
welcome development —but not by enough to lift price inflation consist ently to 2 percent.  
While the underlying global disinflationary factors are likely to evolve over time, there is 
little reason to think that they have suddenly reversed or abated.  It seems more likely that 
they will continue to weigh on inflation as the pandemic passes into history.
14 
We will continue to monitor incoming inflation data against each of these 
assessments.  
To sum up, the baseline outlook is for continued progress toward maximum 
employment, with inflation returning to levels consistent with our goal of inflation 
 
12 On a Q4 -over-Q4 basis, the August 13, 2021, Survey of Professional Forecas ters reports a consensus 
forecast for total personal consumption expenditures inflation of 4.1 percent, 2.2 percent, and 2.3 percent 
for 2021 to 2023, respectively .  The corresponding numbers for core inflation are 3.7 percent, 2.2 percent, 
and 2.1 percent, respectively .  The August 10, 2021, Blue Chip Economic Indicators Forecast presents 
similar consensus forecasts for 2021 and 2022.  
13 For views on this, see  Canon, Kudlyak, and Reed (2015 ), Forbes (2019), Goodhart and Pradhan (2020), 
Obstfeld (2020).  
14 For an opposing view, see Goodhart and Pradhan (2020), who argue that the globalization and 
demographic factors that had been fueling global disinflationary forces are now reversing and could give 
rise to an inflationary period.  Even if we are near an inflection point, as Goodhart and Pradhan argue, 
demographic forces move slowly relative to the near -term policy horizon I am discussing here today.   - 9 - 
averaging 2 percent over time.  Let me now turn to how the baseline outlook and the 
associated risks and uncertainties figure in our monetary policymaking.  
Implications for Monetary Policy  
The period from 1950 through the early 1980s provides two important lessons for 
managing the risks and uncertainties we face today.  The early days of stabilization policy in the 1950s taught monetary policymakers not to attempt to offset what are likely to be temporary fluctuations in inflation.
15  Indeed, responding may do more harm than 
good, particularly in an era where policy rates are much closer to the effectiv e lower 
bound even in good times.  The main influence of monetary policy on inflation can come after a lag of a year or more.  If a central bank tightens policy in response to factors that turn out to be temporary, the main policy effects are likely to arrive after the need has passed.  The ill -timed policy move unnecessarily slows hiring and other economic 
activity and pushes inflation lower than desired.  Today, with substantial slack remaining 
in the labor market and the pandemic continuing, such a mista ke could be particularly 
harmful.  We know that extended periods of unemployment can mean lasting harm to workers and to the productive capacity of the economy.
16   
History also teaches, however, that central banks cannot take for granted that 
inflation du e to transitory factors will fade.  The 1970s saw two periods in which there 
were large increases in energy and food prices, raising headline inflation for a time.  But when the direct effects on headline inflation eased, core inflation continued to run 
 
15 As I discussed here two years ago, Milton Friedman first made this argument referring to the stop -and-go 
policies in the 1950s.  See Powell (2019) and Friedman (1958, p. 241).  Bodenstein , Erceg, and Guerrieri  
(2008) and Mishkin (2007) illustrate the problems that reacting to transitory sources of inflation can cause 
using two of the Board staff’s mod els.  
16 See, for example, Davis and von Wachter (2011) .  - 10 - 
persistently higher than before.  One likely contributing factor was that the public had 
come to generally expect  higher inflation—one reason why we now monitor inflation 
expectations so carefully.17  
Central banks have always faced the problem of distinguis hing transitory inflation 
spikes from more troublesome developments, and it is sometimes difficult to do so with 
confidence in real time.  At such times, there is no substitute for a careful focus on incoming data and evolving risks.  If sustained higher i nflation were to become a serious 
concern, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) would certainly respond and use our tools to assure that inflation  runs at levels that are consistent with  our goal.   
Incoming data should provide more evidence that some of the supply–demand 
imbalances are improving, and more evidence of a continued moderation in inflation, particularly in goods and services prices that have been most affected by the pandemic.  We also expect to see continued strong job creation.  And we w ill be learning more about 
the Delta variant’s effects.  For now, I believe that policy is well positioned; as always, we are prepared to adjust policy as appropriate to achieve our goals.  
That brings me to a concluding word on the path ahead for monetary policy.  The 
Committee remains steadfast in our oft- expressed commitment to support the economy 
for as long as is needed to achieve a full recovery.  T he changes we made last year to our 
Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy are well s uited to address 
today’s challenges.   
We have said that we would continue our asset purchases at the current pace until 
we see substantial further progress toward our maximum employment and price stability 
 
17 See, for example, Orphanides and Williams ( 2013 ) on the role of de -anchored inflation expectations.

goals, measured since last December , when we firs t articulated this guidance.  My view is 
that the “substantial further progress” test has been met for inflation.  There has also been 
clear progress toward maximum employment.  At the FOMC’s recent July meeting, I was of the view, as were most participant s, that if the economy evolved broadly as 
anticipated, it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year.  The intervening month has brought more progress in the form of a strong employment 
report for July, but also the furthe r spread of the Delta variant.  We will be carefully 
assessing incoming data and the evolving risks.  Even after our asset purchases end, our elevated holdings of longer -term securities will continue to support accommodative 
financial conditions.   
The tim ing and pace of the coming reduction in asset purchases will not be 
intended to carry a direct signal regarding the timing of interest rate  liftoff, for which we 
have articulated a different and substantially more stringent test.  We have said that we 
will continue to hold the target range for the federal funds rate at its current level until the economy reaches conditions consistent with maximum employment, and inflation has reached 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.  We have much ground to cover to reach maximum employment, and time will tell whether we have reached 2 percent inflation on a sustainable basis.    
These are challenging times for the public we serve, as the pandemic and its 
unprecedented toll on health and economic activity linger.  But I will end on a positive note.  Before the pandemic, we all saw the extraordinary benefits that a strong labor 
market can deliver to our society.  Despite today’s chal lenges, t he economy is on a path  - 12 - 
to just such a labor market, with high levels of employment and participation , broadly 
shared wage gains , and inflation running close to our price stability goal.   
Thank you very much.

Thank you for this opportunity to speak at the 61st annual meeting of the National 
Association for Business Economics .  
At the Fed, we like to say that m onetary policy is data dependent.  We say this  to 
emphasize that policy is never on a preset course and will change as appropriate in 
response to incoming information.  B ut that does not capture the breadth and depth of 
what data -dependent decisionmaking means to us.   From its beginnings more than a 
century ago, the Federal Reserve has gone to great lengths to collect and rigorously 
analyze the best information  to make sou nd decisions for the public we serve.  
The topic of this meeting, “Trucks and Terabytes:  Integrating the ‘ New’  and 
‘Old’ Economies ,” captures the essence of a major challenge for data -dependent 
policymaking.  We must sort out in real time, as best we can, what the profound changes 
underway in the economy mean for issues such as the functioning of labor markets, the 
pace of productivity growth, and the forces driving inflation.   
Of course, issues like these  have always been with us .  Indeed, 100 years ago, 
some of the first Fed policymakers recognized  the need for more timely information on 
the rapidly evolving state of industry and decided to creat e and publish production 
index es for the United States.  Today I will pay tribute to the  100 years of dedicated—
and often behind the scenes —work of those tracking change in the industrial landscape .   
I will then turn to three challenges our dynamic economy is posing for policy at 
present :  First, what would the consequences of a sharp rise in the price of oil  be for the 
U.S. economy?  This question, which never seems far from relevance, is again drawing 
our attention after recent events in the Persian Gulf.  While the question is familiar,  - 2 - 
technological advances in the energy sector are rapidly changing our assessm ent of the 
answer.   
Second, with terabytes of data increasingly competing with truckloads of goods in 
economic importance, what are the best ways to measure output and productivity?  Put 
more provocatively, might the recent productivity slowdown be an art ifact of antiquated 
measurement?   
Third, how tight is the labor market ?  Given our mandate of maximum 
employment and price stability, this question is at the very core of our work.  But 
answering it in real time in a dynamic economy as jobs are gained in one area but lost in 
others is remarkably challenging.  In August , the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) 
announced that  job gains over the year through March were  likely  a half -million lower 
than previously reported .  I will discuss how we are using big dat a to improve our grasp 
of the job market in the face of such revisions.   
These three quite varied  questions highlight the broad range of issues that  
currently  come under the simple heading “ data dependent.”   After exploring them, I will 
comment briefly on recent developments in money markets and on monetary policy.   
A Century of I ndustrial P roduction 
Our story of data dependence in the face of change begins  when the Fed opened 
for business in 1914.  World War I was breaking out in Europe, and over the next four 
years the war would fuel profound growth and transformation in the U.S. economy.1  But 
you could not have seen this change in the gross national product data; the Department of 
Commerce did not publish those until 1942.  The Census Bureau had been running a 
                                                 
1 Hugh Rockoff (2004) analyzes the change that accompanied a 44- month expansion starting in 1914.   - 3 - 
census of manufactures since 1905, but that came only every five years —an eternity in 
the rapidly changing economy.  In need of  more  timely informa tion, the Fed began 
creating and publishing a  series of  industrial output reports that soon evolved into 
industrial production indexes.2  The indexes initially comprised  22 basic commodities, 
chosen in part because they covered the major industrial groups, but also for the practical 
reason that data were available with less than a one- month lag.  The Fed’s efforts were 
among the earliest in creating timely measures of aggregate production.  Over the century 
of its existence, our industrial production team has remained at the frontier of economic 
measurement, using the most advanced techniques to monitor U.S. industry and nimbly 
track changes in production.   
What A re the C onsequences of an Oil Price S pike?  
Let’s turn now to the first question of the cons eque nces of an oil price spike.   
Figure 1 shows U.S. oil production since 1920.  After rising fairly steadily through the 
early 1970s, production began a long period of gradual decline.  By 2005, production was 
at about the same level as it had been 50 years e arlier.  Since then, remarkable advances 
in the technology for finding and extracting oil have led to a rapid increase in production 
to levels higher than ever before.3  In 2018, the United States became the world’s largest 
oil producer.4  Oil exports have  surged, imports have fallen ( figure 2), and the U.S. 
                                                 
2 For more information on the history of industrial production reporting at the Board, see “Celebrating 100 
Years of the Industrial Production Index” at 
https://www.federal reserve.gov/releases/g17/100_years_of_ip_data.htm .  
3 Decker, Flaaen, and Tito (2016) explore reasons for the resilience of production, even in light of declines 
in oil prices.   
4 Department of Energy (2018).   - 4 - 
Energy Information Administration project s that this month , for the first time in many 
decades, the U nited S tates will be a net exporter of oil.5  
As monetary policymakers, we closely monitor developments in oil markets 
because disruptions in these markets have played a role in several U.S. recessions and in 
the Great Inflation  of the 1960s and 1970s .  Traditionally, we assessed that a sharp rise in 
the price of oil would have a strong negative effect on consumers and businesses and , 
hence , on the U.S. economy.  Today a higher oil price would still cause dislocations and 
hardship for many, but with exports and imports nearly balanced, the higher price paid by 
consumer s is roughly offset by higher earnings of workers and firms in the U.S. oil 
industry.  Moreover, because it is now easier to ramp up oil production, a sustained price 
rise can quickly boost output , providing a shock absorber in the face of supply 
disruptions.  Thus, setting aside the effects of geopolitical uncertainty that may 
accompany higher oil prices, we now judge that a price spike  would likely have nearly 
offsetting effects on U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) .   
How S hould We M easure O utput and Productivity?   
Let’s now t urn to the second question of how to best measure output and 
productivity .  While there are some subtleties in measuring oil output, we know how to 
count barrels of oil.  Measuring the overall  level of  goods and services produced in t he 
economy is fundamentally messier, because it requires adding apples and oranges —and 
automobiles  and myriad other goods and services .  The hard- working statisticians  
creating the official statistics regularly adapt the data sources and methods so that , insofar 
                                                 
5 The Energy Information Administration’s Shor t-Term Energy Outlook (STEO; available at 
https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo ), released on September 10 , 2019,  shows that the United States will 
become a net exporter of crude oil and liquid fuels by October  2019.  A new STEO will be published today.    - 5 - 
as possible,  the measured data  provide accurate indicators of the state of the economy. 
Periods of rapid change present particular challenges, and it can take time for the 
measurement system to adapt  to fully and accurately reflect the changes in the economy.   
The advance of technology has long presented measurement challenges.  In 1987, 
Nobel Prize –winning economist Robert Solow quipped that “ you can see the computer 
age everywhere but in the product ivity statistics.”6  In the second half of the 1990s, this 
measurement puzzle was at the heart of monetary policymaking.7  Chairman Alan 
Greenspan famously argued that the U nited S tates was experiencing the dawn of a new 
economy, and that  potential and act ual output were  likely understated in official statistics.  
Where others saw capacity constraints and incipient inflation, Greenspan saw a 
productivity boom that would leave room for very low unemployment without inflation 
pressures.  In light of the uncer tainty  it faced , the Federal Open Market Committee 
(FOMC)  judged that the appropriate risk -management approach called for refraining 
from interest rate increases unless and until there were clearer signs of rising inflation.  
Under this policy, unemployment fell near record low s without rising inflation, and later 
revisions to GDP  measurement  showed appreciably faster productivity growth.8  
This episode illustrates a key challenge to making data- dependent policy in real 
time:  Good decisions require good da ta, but the data in hand are seldom as good as we 
would like.  Sound decisionmaking there fore requires the application of good judgment 
and a healthy dose of risk management.  
                                                 
6 Solow (1987).  
7 I discuss and document this episode more fully in Powell (2018).  
8 Revision and the role of high tech is described in Seskin (1999) and Jorgenson, Ho, and Stiroh (2008).   - 6 - 
Productivity is again presenting a puzzle.   Official statistics currently show 
productivity growth slowing significantly in recent years, with the growth in output per 
hour worked falling from more than 3 percent a  year from 1995 to 2003 to less than half 
that pace since then.9  Analysts are actively debating three alternative  explanations for 
this apparent  slowdown:  First, the slowdown may be real and may persist indefinitely as 
productivity growth returns to more -normal levels after a brief golden age.10  Second, the 
slowdown may instead be a pause of the sort that often accom panies fundamental 
technological change , so that productivity gains from recent technology advances will 
appear over time as society adjusts.11  Third, the slowdown may be overstated, perhaps 
greatly, because of  measurement issues akin to those at work in t he 1990s.12  At this 
point, we cannot know which of these views may gain widespread acceptance, and 
monetary policy will pla y no significant role in how this puzzle is resolved.  A s in the late 
1990s, however, we are carefully assessing the implications of possibly mismeasured  
productivity gains .  Moreover, productivity growth seem s to have moved up over the past 
year after a long period at very low levels; we do not know whether that welcome trend 
will be sustained.    
Recent research suggests that current official statistics may understate 
productivity growth by missing a significant part  of the growing value we derive from  
fast internet connections and smartphones.  These technologies, which were just 
emerging 15 years ago, are now  ubiquitous (figure 3).  We can now be constantly 
                                                 
9 Between 1995 and 2003 , business- sector output per hour increased at an annual rate of 3.4 percent, and it 
has risen only 1.4 percent since then.  Fernald (2015) suggests 2003 as a break point for the beginning of 
the productivity slowdown.

connected to the accumulated knowledge of hu mankind and receive near instantaneous 
updates on the lives of friends far and wide.  And, adding to the measurement challenge, 
many of these services are free, w hich is to say, not explicitly priced.  How should we 
value the luxury of never needing to ask for directions?  Or the peace and tranquility 
afforded by speedy resol ution of those contentious arguments over the trivia of the 
moment?     
Researchers have tr ied to answer these questions in various ways.13  For example, 
Fed research ers have recent ly proposed a novel approach to measuring the value of 
services consumers derive from  cellphones and other devices  based on the volume of data 
flowing over those conne ctions .14  Taking their accounting at face value , GDP growth 
would have been about 1/2 percentage point higher since 2007, which is an appreciable 
change  and would be very good news .  Growth over the previous couple of decades 
would also  have been about 1/4 percentage point higher as well, implying that  
measurement issues of this sort likely account for only part  of the productivity slowdown 
in current statistics.   Research in this area is at an earl y stage, but this example illustrates 
the depth of analysis  supporting our  data-dependent decisionmaking.   
How T ight Is the L abor M arket ? 
Let me now turn from the measurement issues raised by the information age to an 
issue that has long been at the center of monetary policymaking:  How tight is the labor 
market?   Answering this question is central to our outlook for both of our dual -mandate 
goals of  maximum employment and price stability.  While this topic is always front  and

center in our thinking, I am raising it today to illustrate how we are using big data to 
inform policymaking.   
Until recently,  the official data showed job gains over the year through March 
2019 of about 210,000 a month, which is far higher than necessary to absorb new entrants 
into the labor force and thus hold the unemployment rate constant.   In August, the BLS 
publicly previewed the benchmark data revision coming in February 2020, and the news 
was that job gains over this period were more like 170,000 per month—a meaningfully 
lower number that itself remains subject to revision.  The pace of job gains is hard to pin 
down in real time largely because of the dynamism of our economy:  Many new 
businesses open and others close every month, creating some jobs and ending others, and 
definitive data on this turnover arrive with a substantial lag.  Thus, initial data  are, in part, 
sophisticated guesses based on what is known as the birth–death model of firms.   
Several years ago, we began a collaboration with the payroll processing firm ADP  
to construct a measure of payroll employment from their dat a set, which covers about 
20 percent of the nation’s private workforce and is available to us with a roughly one -
week delay.15  As described in a recent research paper, we construct ed a measure that 
provides an independent read on payroll employment that complement s the official 
statistics.16  While experience is still limited with the new measure, we find promising 
evidence that it can refine our real -time picture of job gains.  For example, in the first 
eight months of 2008, as the Great Recession was getti ng underway, t he official monthly 
employment data showed total job losses of  about 750,000 ( figure 4).  A later benchmark 
                                                 
15 This share  is comparable to th at covered in the sample used by the BLS, but the BLS sample is designed 
to be representative , while the ADP sample is simply their customer base.  
16 Cajner  and others (2019).   - 9 - 
revision told a much bleaker story, with declines of about 1.5 million.  Our new measure, 
had it been available in 2008, would have be en much closer to the revised data, alerting 
us that the job situation might be considerably worse than the official data suggested.17 
We believe that the new measure may help us better understand job market 
conditions in real time.  The preview of the BLS benchmark revision leaves average job 
gains over the year through March solidly above the pace required to accommodate 
growth in the workforce over that time, but where we had seen a booming job market, we 
now see more -moderate growth.  The benchmark revision will not directly affect data  for 
job gains since March, but experience  with past revisions  suggests that some part of the 
benchmark will likely carry forward.  Thus, the currently reported job gains of 157,000 
per month on ave rage over the past three months may well  be revised  somewhat  lower.  
Based on a range of data and analysis, including our new measure, we now judge that , 
even allowing for such a revision, job gains remain above the level required to provide 
jobs for new e ntrants to the jobs market over time.  Of course, the pace of job gains is 
only one of many job market issues that figure into our assessment of how the economy 
is performing relative to our maxim um-employment mandate and our assessment of any 
inflationary  pressures arising in the job market.    
What Does Data Dependence Mean at Present ?  
In summary, data dependence is, and always has been, at the heart of 
policymaking at the Federal Reserve.  We are always seeking out new and better sources 
                                                 
17 Any example about the details of data deserves detailed comment.  Our ADP -based estimate showed job 
losses of about 1 million over this period, considerably more than the real -time BLS data but well short of 
the post -benchmark value.  This episode motivat ed the BLS to revise their procedures in ways that will 
reduce the revisions in similar episodes in the future.  See BLS (2019) for a technical note  last updated in 
August and BLS (2010).     - 10 - 
of information a nd refining our analysis of that information to keep us abreast of 
conditions as our economy constantly reinvents itself.  Before wrapping up, I will discuss 
recent developments in money markets and the current stance of monetary policy.    
Our influence on the financial conditions that affect employment and inflation is 
indirect.  The Federal Reserve sets two overnight interest rates :  the interest rate paid on 
banks’ reserve balances and the  rate on our reverse repurchase agreements.  We use these 
two adm inistered rates to keep a market -determined rate, the federal funds rate, within a 
target range set by the FOMC.  We rely on financial markets to transmit these rates 
through a variety of channels to the rates paid by households and businesses —and to 
finan cial conditions more broadly.     
In mid -September, a n important channel in the transmission process—wholesale 
funding markets —exhibited unexpectedly intense volatility .  Payments to meet corporate 
tax obligations and to purchase Treasury securities triggered notable liquidity pressures in 
money markets.  Overnight interest rates spiked, and the effective federal funds rate 
briefly moved above the FOMC’s target range.  To counter these pressures, we began 
conducting temporary open market operations.  These operations have kept the federal 
funds rate in the target range and alleviated money market strains more generally.  
While a range of factors may have contributed to these developments, it is clear 
that without a sufficient quantity of reserves in the banki ng system, even routine 
increases in funding pressures can lead to outsized movements in money market interest 
rates.  This volatility can impede the effective implementation of monetary policy, and  
we are address ing it.  Indeed, my colleagues and I will s oon announce measures to add to 
the supply of reserves over time.  Consistent with a decision we made in January, our  - 11 - 
goal is to provide an ample supply of reserves to ensure that control of the federal funds 
rate and other short -term interest rates is exercised primarily by setting our administered 
rates and not through frequent market interventions.  Of course, we will not hesitate to 
conduct temporary operations if needed to foster trading in the federal funds market at 
rates within the target range.  
Reserve balances are one among several items on the liability side of the Federal 
Reserve’s balance sheet, and demand for these liabilities —notably, currency in 
circulation —grows over time.  Hence, increasing the supply of reserves or even 
maintaining a gi ven level over time requires us to increase the size of our balance sheet.  
As we indicated in our March statement on balance sheet normalization, at some point , 
we will begin increasing our securities holdings to maintain an appropriate level of 
reserves.18  That time is now upon us .   
I want to emphasize that growth of our balance sheet for reserve  management 
purposes should in no way be confused with the large -scale asset purchase programs that 
we deployed after the financial crisis.  Neither the recent technical issues nor the 
purchases of Treasury bills we are contemplating  to resolve them should materially affect 
the stance of monetary policy, to which I now turn.  
Our goal in monetary policy is to promote maximum employment and stable 
prices, which we interpret as inflation running closely around our symmetric 2 percent 
objective.  At present, the jobs and inflation picture s are favorable.  Many indicators 
show a historically strong labor  market, with solid job gains, the unemployment rate at 
half-centu ry lows, and rising prime -age labor force  participation .  Wages are rising,

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20190320c.htm .   - 12 - 
especially for those with lower -paying jobs.  Inflation is somewhat below our symmetric 
2 percent objective but has been gradually firming over the p ast few months.  FOMC 
participa nts continue to see a sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor 
market conditions, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective as most likely.  
Many outside forecasters agree.    
But there are risks to this favorable outlook, principal ly from global 
developments.  Growth around much of the world has weakened over the  past year  and a 
half, and uncertainties around trade, B rexit, and other issues pose risks to the outlook.  As 
those factors have evolved, my colleagues and I have shifted our views about appropriate 
monetary policy toward a lower path for the federal funds rate and have lowered its  target 
range by 50 basis points.  We believe that our policy actions are providing support for the 
outlook.  Looking ahead,  policy is not on a preset course.  The next FOMC meeting is 
several weeks away, and we will be carefully monitoring incoming information.  We will 
be data dependent, assessing the outlook and risks to the outlook on a meeting -by-
meeting basis.   Taking all that into account, w e will act as appropriate to su pport 
continued growth, a  strong job market , and inflation moving back to our symmetric 2 
percent objective.

We are here to honor two exceptio nal public servants and the great  institution 
they helped build.   Let’s consider for a moment why the Bureau of  Labor Statistics (BLS) 
has succeeded  and how Ca rroll Wright and Janet Norwood contributed to that success.  
In 1884, a time of great strife and mistrust between management and labor, t he 
federal government created an agency with the mission of providing de tailed  and 
objective  information on American workers.  That task fe ll to Ca rroll Wright, who had 
won the confidence of workers and management  as chief of the Massachusetts  Bureau of 
Labor Statistics  in the years after that state became the first to legaliz e labor unions.    
At that point, b efore the United States  itself had recognize d such rights  and before 
the federal government could agree  on labor standards, the public needed an 
unimpeachable assessment of the conditions faced by workers.  Under Carroll Wright, 
what was then called the  Bureau of Labor  investigated  major labor disputes and issued 
reports that shaped public opinion and were the basis for executive action a nd legislation.  
He initiated the collection of data on hours, wages , and prices and w as responsible for 
many important advances that successively improved the reliability of these data.  The 
respect for the thoroughness and objectivity of the research that Wright oversaw led to 
the dismantling of damaging trade barriers in the 1890s and la ter raised public awareness  
about the deplorable conditions faced by women in the work place.    
In the U.S. Constitution, there is  not a requirement that government statistics be 
accurate and free of political influence or bias.  Ca rroll Wright recognized t hat this 
simple, powerful idea could help build public confidence for the government’s  effort to 
reduce conflicts between management and workers and move our nation forward.   He and 
others are responsible for a fundamental feature of our democracy that is now often taken  - 2 - 
for granted --the public’s expectation and insistence that information provided by t he 
government can be trusted.   To Carroll Wright’s descendants, one of whom is with us 
today, thank you, on his behalf, for this valuable contribution.    
This legacy lives on in the agency  Carroll Wright founded , and few of his 
successors did as much to advance this principle as Janet Norwood.  One reason for this  
success, I  am sure, is that she rose from the ranks, and the values of the BLS were deeply 
ingrained  in her over the 28 years  she served this agency .  Those who worked with Janet 
say she strongly believed the BLS was uniquely positioned to contribute to the economic 
policy debate as an authoritative , unimpeachable  source of information and analysis  
about the economy.    
In her 13 years as commissioner, Janet succeeded in winning support for an 
ambitious expansion of the BLS.  She launched the annual Consumer Expenditure 
Survey,  as well as many other important data series, and elevated the skills and quality of 
statistical analysis throughout the agency.   To supplement the traditional measurement of 
productivity as output per hour  of labor , she oversaw t he creation of a new measure of 
multifactor productivity in the private sector, estimating productivity as the result of both 
labor and capital inputs .  When budget pressures threatened to end important data series 
collected elsewhere at the Department of L abor, she found the means to continue these 
series at the BLS.  
At the same time, Janet fac ed challenges to the BLS’s tradition of professionalism 
and objectivity.  From 1979, when she was appointed by President Carter, to 1991,  when 
she retired, the news on employment, productivity , and inflation was often bad.  In this  - 3 - 
circumstance, the BLS wa s sometimes accused of overstating economic problems, and it  
occasionally came under pr essure to alter the basis for its data.   
Janet Norwood fended off these challenges with a mixture of resolve  and 
flexibility, channeling some of the pressure into deliberate and constructive processes that 
eventually yielded improvements in the consumer price index and generated alternative 
price measures.  As commissioner  and like her predecessors , Janet helped preserve the 
BLS’s deserved reputation for accuracy and integrity by continually improving the 
design, procedures , and techniques of data collection.  
After government service, Janet had a long and active retirement in which she 
continued her contributions to the economic profession a nd the science of statistics .  She 
passed away on March 31 of this year.   
To members of he r family who a re with us today, thank you for her extraordinary 
service to our country.  Janet’s  legacy co ntinues in the ongoing work of the exceptional  
agency she helped build , on the foundation laid by Ca rroll Wright, who m she so 
appropriately joins today in this Hall of Honor.   
The Bureau of Labor Statistics  is exceptional, and in that way, I hope it serve s as 
an example of how effe ctive, reliable , and trusted gov ernment can be.    ",2015-10-20,yellen

Paul and Alan have me at a disadvantage.  Each of us was  asked to reflect on our 
own term in office.  But t hey have the benefit  of perspective, whereas my term still has a 
short time to run.  Moreover, work on some of the Fe deral Reserve’s most important 
challenges  of the past few years --notably , achieving a full economic recovery from the 
crisis and putting in place a new financial regulatory system --is still ongoing .  
Nonetheless , I will offer a few thoughts on the past ver y eventful eight years.  
The Federal Reserve’s extraordinary response to the financial crisis and the Great 
Recession that followed was, in one  sense, nothing new.  We did what central banks have 
done for many years  and what they were designed to do:   We served as a source of 
liquidity and stability in financial markets , and, in the broader economy, we worked to 
foster economic recovery  and price stability.  However , in another sense, what we did 
was very new --it was unprecedented in both scale and scope , and it made use of a number 
of tools  that were new, or at least not part of the standard central bank toolkit .  We found 
that these new tools were necessary if we were to fulfill  the classic functions of a central 
bank in the context of a  21st  century econ omic and financial environment. 
 When the financial system teetered near  collapse  in 2008 and 2009, w e responded  
as the 19 th century British essayist Walter Bagehot advised , by serving as liquidity 
provider of last resort to stressed financial firms  and ma rkets.1  But we  did so in an 
institutional environment that was very different, and in many ways much more complex, 
than the one that Bagehot knew.  For example, the recent crisis involved runs on financial institutions, as occurred in classic panics.  But  in 2008, r ather than a run of retail bank 
deposits, the runs occurred in various forms of short -term, uninsured wholesale funding, 
                                                 
1 See Walter Bagehot ([1873] 1897), Lombard Street:  A Description of the Money Market (New York:  
Charles Scribner’s Sons).    - 2 - 
such as commercial paper and  repurchase agreements.   Moreover, although commercial 
banks suffered large losses and some came  under significant pressure, the crisis hit 
particularly hard those nonbank institutions most dependent on wholesale funding, such 
as investment banks  and securitization vehicles .  Thus, the Fed lent not only to 
commercial banks , but also extended its liquidity facilities  to critical  nonbank institutions  
and key financial markets , such as the commercial paper market .  To minimize the risk of 
strains abroad feeding back on U.S. dollar funding markets, t he Fed also coordinated  with 
foreign central banks to create  a network of currency swap lines.  
Beyond the provision of liquidity, the Fed worked with other agencies both here 
and abroad to help restore public confidence in the financial system.  Notably, we led the 
development of stre ss-testing  large banking organizations’ capital adequacy .  The first 
stress test s, in 2009, and the public disclosure of the ir results made it possible for large 
U.S. banks to once again attract private capital.  Since 2009, the stress tests and 
disclosure s, together with other regulatory and supervisory actions, have contributed to a 
doubling in capital held by the largest U.S. financial institutions  and the  resumption of  
more -normal flows of credit . 
The Fed has also worked to draw the appropriate lessons from the crisis and to 
take the steps necessary to help avoid a similar event in the future.  As those assembled here well know, the deliberations that led to the founding of the Federal Reserve  were 
precipitated by a financial panic, the Panic of 1907 .  The preservati on of financial 
stability was consequently a principal goal  of the  creators of the  new central bank.  In 
response to the Panic of 2008, the Federal Reserve has  returned to its  roots by restoring 
financial stability as a central objective alongside the traditional goals of monetary  - 3 - 
policy .  We have refocused our supervision of financial institutions to take a more 
“macroprudential” approach that fosters systemic stability as wel l as the stability of 
individual institutions.  We also more extensively monitor the financial system as a whole 
and, in cooperation with other agencies, have put in place stronger oversight of systemic ally important financial firms, including higher capit al and liquidity 
requirements, tougher supervision, and a process for the orderly resolution of failed 
firms . 
We have also  had to be  innovative in finding ways to use  monetary policy to help 
the economy recover  from the deep recession that followed the cri sis.  Providing 
adequate monetary accommodation  has not been a straightforward  task because our 
principal monetary policy tool, the target for the federal funds rate, has been stuck nea r 
zero since the end of 2008.  Consequently, w e’ve had to find other wa ys to  bring 
monetary policy to bear , notably including techniques designed to influence longer -term 
interest rates.  For instance, the Fed, like several other central banks, has purchased 
longer -term securities to put downward pressure on longer -term inter est rates, help ease 
financial conditions , and promote a stronger recovery.  
A significant aspect  of finding innovative ways to execute our duties as a central 
bank in a new, more complex environment has been the ongoing revolution in communication and transparency.  Part of that effort has involved formally defining our goals under the mandate for maximum employment and price stability given to us by the Congress.  Two years ago, we established 2 percent as our inflation goal , and we 
regularly communicate p olicymakers’ views of the level of unemployment expected to 
correspond to maximum sustainable employment  over time .  Additionally, our  monetary  - 4 - 
policy has come to rely more heavily on “forward guidance.”  With our short -term policy 
rate about as low as it can practicably go, we have sought to ease financial conditions 
further and provide additional impetus to the recovery by communicating both quantitatively about the likely future path of our policy rate and qualitatively about the likely evolution of our balance sheet.  Other central banks around the world have met the challenge of current conditions with similar innovations.  And I would be remiss if I did 
not point out, especially with Paul and Alan here, that the Fed’s recent communications 
innovations owe a great deal to developments like the monetary targeting framework devised under Chairman Volcker and the post -Federal O pen M arket C ommittee  statement 
and qualitative forward guidance introduced under Chairman Greenspan.  
In summary, the financial crisis that the Fed confronted five years ago was in 
many ways analogous to the panics that central banks have faced for centuries.  But, at the same time, the crisis  and the deep recession that followed occurred in a n economic 
and financial environment that wa s certainly different , and in many ways more complex , 
than in the past.  The Federal Reserve found ways to carry out its  traditional central bank 
functions in this environment , and we are working with other policymakers , domestically 
and internationally , to put in place a strengthened regulatory framework  that will help 
preserve stability in the face of  the complexity , interconnectedness , and innovation in our 
modern financial system . 
One of my personal objectives since I became Chairman has been to increas e the 
transparency of the Fed --to more clearly explain how our policies are intended to work 
and the thinking behind our decisions.  As I already noted, improved communication can help our policies work better, whether through the disclosure of bank stress- test results or  - 5 - 
by helping the public and market participants better understand how monetary policy is 
likely to evolve.  Ultimately, however, the most important reason for transparency and clear communication is to help ensure the accountability  of our i ndep endent institution to 
the American people and their elected representatives.   Clarity, transparency, and 
accountability help build public confidence  in the Federal Reserve, which is essential if it 
is to be successful in  foster ing stability and prosper ity.

July 9, 2019  
  
Good morning everyone and t hank you to President Rosengren and the Boston 
Fed for hosting this conference.  
The Federal Reserve is strongly committed to stress testing  as a cornerstone of 
our bank supervis ory and financial stability mission s.  Stress test ing is perhaps the most 
successful  supervisory innovation of the post -crisis era.  But  if stress tests are to 
continue  to serve their critical function, they will need to evolve in the years ahead  to 
keep pace with the ever -changing financial system , as they have since the first round of 
tests in 2009.   
Before looking to the future, l et me recall a bit of history .  A little more than 
10 years ago, the United States an d the world teetered on the brink of economic 
catastrophe.  What was urgently needed was a way to restore confidence in the financial 
system —a daunting challenge.  Neither the banks , nor the regulators , nor the public had a 
reliable  sense o f the strength and resilience of our major banks .  The  announcement  of 
forward -looking stress -testing results in May  2009 helped restore confidence and 
stabilize banks by providing a credible and independent  picture of the ir finances.1  These 
original stre ss tests evolved into the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review , or 
CCAR,  program, which has served to institutionalize capital planning by firms, and 
supervision by the Fed, as a forward -looking endeavor.  
                                                 
1 The stress tests were announced in February 2009 , and the results were released in May 2009.  See, 
respectively , Board of Governors  of the Federal Reserve System , Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 
Office of the  Comptroller of the Currency, and Office of Thrift S upervision (2009), “ Agencies to Begin 
Forward -Looking Economic Assessments ,” joint press release, February 25 ,

Program ,” press release, May 7,

Since 2009, large banks have added more than $800 billion in common equity 
capital, giving them a much thicker cushion to deal with losses.  B anks have gotten much 
better at assessing and managing their risks, effectively track ing commitments across 
their o rganizations , anticipating capital needs, and plan ning for different scenarios.  
The stress tests of the future —5 and 10 years from now —will need to continue  to 
ensure that banks  remain able , even in a severe downturn, to provide  the credit that 
households and businesses depend on.  As financial institutions and the financial system 
evolve, stress testing will need to keep up.  When the next episode of financial instability 
presents itself, it may do so in a messy and unexpected way.  Banks will need to be r eady 
not just for expected risks, but for unexpected ones .  Thus, the tests will need to vary 
from year to year, and to explore even quite unlikely scenarios.  
If the stress tests do not evolve, they risk becoming a compliance exercise, 
breeding complacency  from both supervisors and banks.  We might also, inadvertently, 
encourage the development of a  banking system where , over time , all banks would look 
much alike rather than the banking system we want and need, one  with diverse 
institutions with different b usiness models.   We simply can’t let these things happen.  
The purpose of today’s gathering is to help us think about how to ensure the tests 
continue to foster  a dynamic banking system, financial stability , and a healthy and 
growing economy.  We have invited a wide range participants—fellow regulators, 
bankers, analysts, academics, and community groups —with diverse perspectives.  
Because we do  not claim  a monopoly on knowle dge or wisdom , we have invited many 
who have disagreed with us in the past.  I s trongly believe that diverse  perspectives and 
healthy debate will sharpen our thinking and lead us to better answers.   - 3 - 
I’m sorry I’m not able to be with you today.  And I want to particularly thank all 
of the  speakers, discussants, and other participants fo r helping us grapple with the 
challenges of ensuring that  tomorrow’s stress tests remain as effective and vigorous  as 
they are today .  Thank you.

Roundtable on the Interim Report of the Alternative Reference Rates Committee

   I want to thank you all for coming today, and I also want to tha nk the Alternative 
Reference Rates Committee ( ARRC)  for all its work in developing its  interim report.  This report 
marks a new stage in reference rate reform.1  Reference benchmarks are a key part of the 
financial infrastructure .  About $300 trillion dollars in contracts reference LIBOR  alone.  But  
benchmarks  were not given much consideration prior to the recent  scandals  involving attempts to 
manipulate them.  Since then, the official sector has thought seriously about financial 
benchmarks, conducting a number of investigations into charges of manipulation, publishing the 
International O rganization of S ecurities Commission’s (IOSCO)  Principles for Financial 
Benchmarks  and, through the F inancial S tability Board (FSB) , sponsoring major reform efforts 
of both interest rate and foreign exchange benchmarks.2  The institutions represented on the 
ARRC have also had to think seriously about these issues as they have developed this interim report.  Now, we need end users to begin to think more seriously about how they use benchmarks 
and the risks  they  are taking on by relying so heavily on a reference rate--in this case U.S. dollar 
LIBOR --that is less resilient than it need s to be.   
In saying this, I want to make it clear that LIBOR has been significantly improved.  I CE 
Benchmark Administration is in the process of making important changes to its methodology , 
and submissions to LIBOR are now regulated by the United Kingdom ’s Financial Conduct 
Authority .  However, the term money market  borrowing by banks that underlies  U.S. dollar 
LIBOR has experienced  a secular decline.  As a result, the majority of U .S. dollar  LIBOR 
submissions must still rely on expert judgement, and even those submissions that are transaction-

2 For more in formation on the IOSCO principles, see Board of the International Organization of Securities 
Commissions (2013), Principles for Financial Benchmarks:  Final Report  (Madrid:  IOSCO, July),

 based may be based on relatively few actual trades.  This calls into question whether LIBOR  can 
ultimately satisfy IOSCO Principle 7 regarding data sufficiency , which requires that a 
benchmark be based on an active market.  That Principle is a particularly important one, as it is 
difficult to ask banks  to subm it rates  at which they believe they could borrow on a daily basis if 
they do not actually borrow very often.   
That basic fact poses the risk that LIBOR could eventually be forced to stop publication 
entirely .  Ongoing regulatory reforms and changing market structures raise questions about 
whether the transactions underlying LIBOR will  become even scarcer in the future, particularly 
in periods of stress, and banks m ight feel little incentive to con tribute to U .S. dollar  LIBOR 
panels if transactions become less frequent .  Market participants are not used to thinking about 
this possibility , but benchmarks sometimes come to a halt .  The sudden cessation of  a benchmark 
as heavily used as LIBOR would present significant systemic risks.  It could entail substantial 
losses and would create substantial uncertainty , potential legal challenges , and payments 
disruptions for the market participants that have relied  on LIBOR.  T hese disruptions would be 
even  greater i f there were no viable alternative to U .S. dollar  LIBOR that market participants 
could quickly move to.   
 These concerns led the FSB and Financial Stability Oversight Council to call for the 
promotion of alternatives to LIBOR , and led the Federal Reserve to convene the ARRC  in 
cooperation with the U.S. Treasury Department, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and Office of Financial Research .  LIBOR is currently the dominant reference rate in the market 
because of its liquidity.  We are not  under any  illusions that moving a significant portion of 
trading to an alternative rate will be simple or easy.  B ut I believe the ARRC has provided a 4 
 workable and credible plan for creating liquidity in a new rate and beginning the process of 
moving trading to it.     
We need input from end users and others to finalize the ARRC’s plans, and I look 
forward to hearing the views of those in attendance.  Successful implementation will require a coordinated effort from a broad set of market participants .  This effort will certainly entail costs, 
but continued reliance on U .S. dollar LIBOR on the current scale could entail much higher costs 
if unsecured short -term borrowing decline s further and submitting banks cho ose to leave the 
LIBOR panels, especially if there were no viable alternative rate.  Simply put, this effort is something that needs to happen, and i f the ARRC members, the official sector, and end users and 
other market participants all jointly coordinate in finalizing these plans, then a successful transition can be made with the least disr uption to the market , leaving everyone in a better place.

Empowering Community Banks  
 
 
 
Remarks by 
 
Michelle W. Bowman  
 
Member   
 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  
 
at the 
 
Conference for Community Bankers   
sponsored by  
The American Bankers  Association  
 
Orlando, Florida  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
February 10, 2020 
Thank you to the American Bankers Association for inviting me to address this 
year’s Conference for Community Bankers.  I am delighted to be here with you again. 
Let me begin by stating that the views I express today are my own, and not necessarily 
those of the Federal Reserve.   
As community bankers, you have worked hard to develop a deep understanding of 
your local economies, while also keeping perspective on the broader economic picture.  
There is little I could tell you about your local communities that you do not already 
know, but I thought I might say a few words on the national economic outlook before 
turning to my main topic for today.   
My colleagues and I on the Federal Open Market Committee had our most recent 
meeting about two weeks ago, when we decided to keep our targe t range for the federal 
funds rate unchanged at 1- 1/2 to 1 -3/4 percent.  This policy setting should help support 
the economic expansion, which is now in its 11th year.  My outlook for the U.S. economy 
is for continued growth at a moderate pace, with the unemployment rate —which is the 
lowest it has been in 50 years—remaining low.  I also see inflation gradually rising to the 
Committee’s 2 percent objective.  So on the whole, the national economic backdrop looks 
very favorable, which should be broadly support ive of your local economies.  And of 
course, by ensuring that consumers and businesses in your communities have access to 
financial services, you are key contributors to the health of our national economy.  
Let me now turn to my main topic for today, the i nteraction between innovation 
and regulation for community banks.  As the Federal Reserve Board’s first designated 
governor with experience in community banking, I am committed to maintaining a strong 
and thriving community bank sector.  Small banks are th e lifeblood of their  - 2 - 
communities —and they ensure that consumers and businesses have access to financial 
services.  This capacity to address local needs is fundamental to a strong and stable 
financial system.  To community bankers, customers are much more t han their credit 
score or their annual income, and small businesses are far more than their most recent 
revenues.  By extending credit and offering specialized products and services that meet 
the needs of their borrowers, these banks empower communities to thrive.  
We live in an exciting time, when the face of banking is changing faster and 
perhaps more fundamentally than it ever has.  The first digital banks appeared on the 
scene about 25 years ago.  Since then, financial technology has evolved rapidly.  
Technology puts more information in the hands of both the customer and the bank.  As 
financial institutions succeed in digitizing more of their offerings, customers are able to 
monitor cash flows, make direct payments, understand changes in their credit scor es, 
track spending, and budget more easily.  Technologies like predictive analytics, when 
supported with appropriate consumer protections, can improve bank services and 
performance by enabling continuous tailoring of the customer experience.  It also helps  
banks identify products that are best  suited for their customers and their business model 
and strategy.  For those account holders who are willing, an analysis of spending habits 
may indicate that they could benefit from services they hadn’t yet considere d.  
But successful i nnovation is not just about adopting the latest technologies.  
Successful innovation has always required strategic vision and creativity.  C ommunity 
banks thrive when they find creative ways to  serve their communities , using everything 
they know to build relationships , offer solutions,  and make lending decisions.  We need   - 3 - 
only look to the performance of community banks during the fina ncial crisis to see how 
well they  leverage this local knowledge and their relationships to make lending decisions.   
After the onset of the crisis, community banks’ superior loan quality resulted in 
lower aggregate delinquency and charge -off rates compared to the largest banks.  This 
superior performance  was widespread —community banks in the vast majority of states 
outperformed the largest banks in this way.1    
Even today, community banks continue to perform with distinction.  In the third 
quarter  of 2019, community banks ’ pre-tax return on average assets was 1.5 percent, 
marking the highest  pre-tax return on assets ratio reported by community banks since 
2006.  Asset quality also remain s strong for community banks and is better than for larger 
banks .  The community bank ne t charge -off rate for total loans and leases was less than 
0.2 percent  at the end of the third quarter 2019.  Let me state that again —the net charge-
off rate was less than 0.2 percent , less than half of the industry average .  Community 
bank c apital levels remain at continued high and increasing levels.  Community banks 
reported a total risk -based capital ratio of nearly 16 percent, as compared to the industry 
average of less than 15 percent.  This type of performance positions the community 
banking sector for continued success this year and well into the future , helping ensur e the 
preservation of the community bank model for future generations of Americans.  
Community banks understand their bor rowers and their specific needs.  While 
technology continues to evolve and change the way we live and bank for the better, it still 
cannot by itself fulfill th at unique and vital role .

Today, t here are more than 4,800 community banks in the U nited S tates.2  Nearly 
80 percent of these have assets totaling less than $500 million , with roughly 40 full - and 
part-time employees , on average .  The vast majority  of these  community banks are 
financially strong, and are  the backbone of the towns and cities they serve, providing 
loans to individuals and businesses in the local area.   But as customers’ needs and goals  
evolve, community banks will need to evolve to meet them.   
The s uccessful integration of financial technolog y into the community bank 
business  model is proving to be enormous ly valuable  to enable  community banks to 
enhance  the services they’ve already proven they can deliver  effectively .  Access to 
technology and services to meet customer needs is critical to ensuring  community  banks 
remain vibrant.   
For the remainder of my remarks, I will focus on my vision for creating pathways 
to responsible community bank innovation.  In particular, I will discuss the promise and 
the challenges that smaller banks face in identifying, integrating, and de ploying 
transformative  new technologies, and I will offer some ideas for how the Federal Reserve 
can help community banks find and manage their relationships with service providers.  
Clearing a Path for Innovation  
 Community banks have always been innovato rs, but rapid technology adoption is 
challenging for banks of all sizes .  In most cases, realizing the potential that technology 
offers  requires community banks to obtain services from other companies or products 
from core service providers , which I will refer to collectively as third -party providers .  As 
I noted earlier, banks  with less than $500 million in assets employ roughly 40 people  on

2019 ), https://www.fdic .gov/bank/analytical/qbp/2019sep/qbp.pdf#page=1 .   - 5 - 
average—nowhere near the number required to exhaustively develop, test , and manage  
every element of  novel technologies.  I n my discussions with bankers, they note that the 
process of selecting, initially vetting, and continuing to evaluate third -party service 
providers is  onerous and presents obst acles  to successful innovation.   
I agree that the cost of complying with some of our regulations and expectations 
for third -party relationships can pose an outsized and undue burden on smaller banks . 
These compliance costs are in some instances disproportionate to bank size, complexity, 
risk, and capacity  and can be  the same for a bank with $10 million in assets and a bank 
with $10 billion in as sets.  Further,  expectations of due diligence when applied to a  
potential fintech partner may require more financial history or information tha n that 
partner can provide.     
Due diligence for new third- party relationships , even those that are not start -ups, 
can require a community bank to collect and analy ze a significant amount of complex 
information .  Also , the annual monitoring that is required adds  an additional  significant 
and ongoing burden.  The process for  managing the  annual  collection and review of the 
financials, audit results, and other operational compliance materials for multiple vendors 
can take weeks of time for several employees.  Bank employees must review thousands 
of pages of documentation, and t he workload per vendor can be  the same for all banks, 
regardless of their asset size and number of  employees.   And as someone who has been  
involved in this compliance  work , I know that  it’s no t as if other responsibilities can 
wait—community bank employees often wear several hats.   Community banks must 
weigh the benefit of any third -party relationship against the additional work required to 
evaluate th e third party.  And e ven when new product offerings emerge from servi ce  - 6 - 
providers that already serve the bank, contract terms can be complicated to adjust , adding 
to the costs of obtaining technologies , which may ultimately be prohibitive .  Flexible core 
systems are important  for this reason .  Collab oration between a bank and it s core system 
provider is critical to ensure that technology solutions can be integrated quickly and cost 
effectively within the core system.  
Creating the R ight R egulatory E nvironment  
Responsible  innovation, especially for smaller institutions, requires two key 
aspects : a clear idea of how the technology serves a bank’s strategic objectives and a 
regulatory environment that supports  innovation.  I will touch today on the important 
interplay between these factors, and in particular, the  role that regulators  can play in 
creating  a regulatory environment that is conducive to innovation, preserve s the safety 
and soundness of the financial system , and protect s consumers.   As regulators, we need to 
ensure that bank s uphold sound risk -management practices.  Yet we also have 
information that can help community banks meet those standards.  We should closely 
examine opportunities to share that knowledge, subject to appropriate safeguards, in 
order to support innovation.  
Responsible innovation begins with a bank’s  strategy.  Banks need to identify 
their goals  and then look to identify the kinds of products and services that can help them 
move forward to implement that strategy .  In the past , I have spoken about the 
impor tance of considering the impact of new technologies and finding ways to leverage 
them, if a bank feels that it fits into its business model  and strategy.  For community 
banks, a decision  to embrace a new technology or  innovation is almost always 
synonymous  with third -party engagement.   - 7 - 
Regulators and supervisors can contribute to an environment where banks are 
empowe red to achieve these strategic objectives, simplifying and clarifying the process of 
third -party selection, due diligence, and monitoring.  
A bank may decide that its business model should evolve, and that offering a new 
product or partnering with a fintech company will help it position itself for future growth.  
This decision is an essential one, but what comes next?   This is a new world for most  
community banks, and supervisors and regulators can lend their expertise to those banks 
seeking to navigate the unfamiliar landscape .  
To that end, the Federal Reserve recently launched a web  page on innovation and 
announc ed several upcoming Reserve Bank events.  The  innovation page on our website 
(www.federalr eserve.gov/innovate ) is intended to be a one -stop shop for supervisory 
information, publications, research, and international work that is related to  technolog y 
innovation.  Most importantly , the web page also facilitates interaction with  Federal 
Reserve System specialists, to enable bank ers and tech industry participants to submit 
questions about  all aspects of technology in the financial services industry , or to request 
an in-person  meeting.  Essentially, to open a dialogue. 
We have also launched a series of Innovation Office Hours  event s host ed by 
Reserve Banks.  These events  incorporate  panel discussions and face- to-face meetings for 
bankers with regulators and supervisors , which are intended to be a resource for both 
state member  banks and fintech companies  seeking partnerships with or  offering services 
to banks.  During these meetings, banks that attend the office hours will have an 
opportunity to share specific projects or proposed partnerships and learn about how 
regulators approach and consider risk management in those contexts.  Re gulators can also  - 8 - 
share their observations about effective implementation and risk- management practices 
across the sector.  Equally important, the events provide regulators  an opportunity to hear 
directly from banks and fintech companies  about challenges t o innovation .  The office 
hours events will also include a panel discussion on innovation topics that will help to 
provide additional insights into new financial technologies .  Our  first office hours event 
will be held at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta later this month .  Additional events 
are planned later in the spring and throughout the rest of the year.  These are an important 
opportunity for us to learn, and I look forward to hearing your feedback on these event s. 
I’d like to turn next to another step in this process —the selection of a third -party 
provider .  This step can be challenging given a lack of information about potential 
partners  when many firms, and their product  offerings , are new .  Notably, in the 2019 
National Survey of Community Banks , community bankers voiced a de sire for more 
transparency into  third -party service providers, to inform decisions about whether to enter 
into contracts with these providers and the type of contract that may be appropriate.3  
In this regard, I believe the Federal Reserve should consider  several possible 
steps.  First, we should explore the possibility of  publishing the list of service providers 
subject to supervision by the agencies.  This c ould provide a starting point for community 
banks by sharing information about the types of companies providing services to a large 
number of financial institutions .   
Second, I believe we should increase  transparency around our own practices .  
Through the banking agencies’ service provider program, we regularly conduct 
exam inations  for and produce independent evaluations  of certain  providers  of critical 
                                                 
3See https://www.communitybanking.org/~/media/files/publication/cb21publication_2019.pdf .

services.  These exams are focused on risk management, audit, and internal controls.  The 
Fed and other agencies  have the s tatutory authority to oversee third -party providers that 
serve the banks they supervise.  Providers that represent a significant level o f risk to their 
clients are part of an interagency supervisory program.  The agencies make the outcomes 
of those exams a vailable to banks that are clients of a supervised service provider.    
I believe we can take a step further with increasing transparency on our 
supervisory program by making information that may be useful about our supervision of 
key service providers avai lable to banks .  This could take a number of forms, such as 
being more transparent about who and what we evaluate.  Of course, moving forward in 
these areas requires careful consideration and interagency collaboration , and I have asked 
our staff to work with other agencies to develop and propose workable options for giving 
banks the benefit of the knowledge that supervisors  have about their potential providers  
in an appropriate manner .  
Once banks seeking to innovate have navigated the selec tion process and 
identified a partner, they now face a complicated  due-diligence process.  I believe that 
regulators and supervisors have a role in easing the burden of that process  for community 
banks in several respects.   
First, we could help by impleme nting clear third -party guidance that is consistent 
across all regulatory agencies.  The Federal Reserve is in the process of working with the 
other banking agencies to update our third -party guidance.  I believe that the banking 
agencies should all have consistent expectations for third -party relationships, and that the 
Federal Reserve should, as a starting point, move toward adopting the Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency ’s (OCC) guidance.  It is incredibly inefficient to have banks  - 10 - 
and their potential fintech partners and  other vendors try to navigate unnecessary 
differences and inconsistencies  in guidance across agencies.   
Second, this guidance should allow banks to conduct shared due diligence  on 
potential partners .  If several banks use the sam e third -party service provider and are 
open to collaborating, they should be allowed to pool resources  instead of duplicating one 
another’s work.   
Third, the  guidance should explain what due diligence looks like for a potential 
fintech partner, because th e standards applied to other third parties may not be universally 
applicable.  For example, many fintech companies lack the kind of long financial history 
associated with more traditional b ank vendors.  Perhaps a fintech company has been 
around for only a few years.  On its own, the fact that a bank cannot evaluate more than 
five years of the company’s financials should not necessarily stop this company from 
being considered as a partner.  Every bank has different objectives, and potential 
partnerships are not one -size- fits-all.  Regulators should especially support partnerships 
that combine the strengths of community banks and fintech companies, which have a 
track record of success.  The guidance should reflect some supervisory flexibility, and not 
impede prudent, strategic partnerships between community banks and potential partners.  
Fourth, i n order to give community banks a better picture of what success in due 
diligence looks like, and where it begins and ends, I also believe  that we should release 
more i nformation on its necessary elements.   This change would provide clarity and assist 
community banks in completing their work.  In particular, I believe that regulators can 
provide more clarity on the types of questions that should be asked of a prospective  third -
party provider and our view of a satisfactory answer.  Such a handbook would not only  - 11 - 
have the benefit of increasing transparency for community banks but could also be 
beneficial for fintech companies that hope to become third- party providers.   
Finally, I know from experience that once due diligence has concluded, the 
evaluation of third -party relationships is not over.  As I noted earl ier, monitoring can take 
weeks of work every year for community bank employees.  To be sure, this work is an 
import ant part of risk management.  But I believe  regulators and supervisors have a role 
to play in ensuring that  the burden is tailored to bank size, risk, complexity, and capacity.  
Knowing the burden that third -party monitoring can present to employees  of the smallest 
banks, I have encouraged Federal Reserve staff to consider options for further tailoring 
our expectations for community banks with assets under  $1 billion in this area .  We 
should be mindful that when we apply the same expectations to banks with starkly 
different asset sizes, we are creating the same workload for a bank with  about 30 
employees as for a bank with roughly 180 employees, even though their resources and 
risk profiles are quite different .    
Closing R emarks  
To conclude, I believ e that w e can creat e a regulatory environment in which 
community banks are empowered to innovate , in which supervisors leverage their own 
knowledge to help banks understand what to look for in a service provider .  It’s a 
regulatory environment in which gui dance is clear and supervisors are appropriately 
flexible, and due diligence and third- party evaluations are appropriate ly scaled .  
Every bank must decide for itself whether and how to adapt their business models 
to new technologies, but s upervisors and regulators can facilitate innovation  at a few key 
milestones on that path  forward .  First, supervisors and regulators can serve as a resource  - 12 - 
for banks navigating the financial technology landscape for  the first time, and make 
subject -matter  experts accessible.  Second, we  can make the process of selecting a partner 
appropriate for a bank’s business strategy a more informed one, by being more 
transparent about our own supervisory program for certain service providers.  Third, we 
can facilitat e vetting of  potential partners by allowing shared due diligence, providing in 
our guidance  specific expectations for partnerships with fintech companies,  and 
publishing a handbook of sound practices in due diligence.  Finally, we can reduce 
burden on banks as they continue to evaluate risk at third -party providers , by rightsizing 
our expectations and sharing more information about our supervisory program .  Capacity, 
in addition to complexity and size, should be consider ed as we continue to tailor 
superviso ry expectations.  
As we work toward the environment I described, communication between 
regulators, supervisors, ba nks, and fintech partners must be frequent , and confusion about 
compliance requirements must not be  an impediment to banks who wish to partner  with 
third parties .  I believe the steps I have laid out today are a promising beginning  to 
making this regulatory environment a reality .

Monetary Policy and Price Stability  
   
Remarks by  
 
Jerome H. Powell  
 
Chair  
 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  
 
at 
 
“Reassessing Constraints on the Economy and Policy,” an economic policy symposium 
sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  
 
Jackson Hole, Wyoming  
       
August 26, 2022 
  
Thank you for the opportunity to speak here today. 
At past Jackson Hole conferences , I have discussed broad topics such as the ever -
changing structure of the economy and the challenges of conducting monetary policy under high uncertainty.  Today, my remarks will be shorter, my focus narrower, and my message m ore direct.  
The Federal Open Market Committee’s ( FOMC ) overarching focus right now is 
to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal.  Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy.  Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone.  In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.  The burdens of high inflation fall heaviest on those who are least able to bear them.    
Restoring price stability will take so me time and require s using our tools 
forcefully to bring demand and supply into better balance.  Reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below -trend growth.  Moreover, there will very likely be 
some softening of labor market conditions.  While higher interest rates, slower growth, and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to households and businesses.  These are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation.  But a failure to restore pri ce stability would mean  far greater pain.  
The U.S. economy is clearly slowing from the historically high growth rates of 
2021, which reflected the reopening of the economy following the pandemic recession.  While the latest economic data have been mixed, in my view our economy continues to show strong underlying momentum.  The labor market is particularly strong, but it is clearly out of balance, with demand for workers substantially exceeding the supply of  - 2 - 
available workers.  Inflation is running well above 2 percent, and high inflation has 
continued to spread through the economy.  While the lower inflation readings for July are welcome, a single month’s improvement falls far short of what the Committee will need to see before we are confident that inflati on is moving down.    
We are moving our policy stance purposefully to a level that will be  sufficiently 
restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent.  At our most recent meeting in July, the FOMC raised the target range for the federal funds rate to 2.25 t o 2.5 percent, which is in the 
Summary of Economic Projection’s ( SEP) range of estimates of where the federal funds 
rate is projected to settle in the longer run.  In current circumstances, with inflation running far above 2 percent and the labor market extremely tight, estimates of longer -run 
neutral are not a place to stop or pause.   
July’s increase in the target range was the second 75 basis point increase in as 
many meetings, and I said then that another unusually large increase could be appropriate 
at our next meeting.  We are now about halfway through the intermeeting period.  Our 
decision at the September meeting will depend on the totality of the incoming data and the evolving outlook.  At some point , as the stance of monetary policy tightens furthe r, it 
likely will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases .   
Restoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive policy stance 
for some time.  The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy.  Commi ttee participants’ most recent individual projections from the June SEP 
showed the median federal funds rate running slightly below 4 percent  through the end of 
2023.  Participants will update their projections at the September  meeting .  
  - 3 - 
Our monetary poli cy deliberations and decisions build on what we have learned 
about inflation dynamics both from the high and volatile inflation of the 1970s and 
1980s, and from the low and stable inflation of the past quarter -century.  In particular, we 
are drawing on thr ee important lessons.     
The first lesson is that central banks can  and should take responsibility for 
delivering low and stable inflation.  It may seem strange now that central bankers and others once needed convincing on these two fronts, but as former Chairman Ben Bernanke has shown, both propositions were widely questioned during the Great Inflation period.
1  Today, we regard these questions as settled.  Our responsibility to deliver price 
stability is unconditional.  It is true that the current high inflation is a global phenomenon, and that many economies around the world face inflation as high or higher than seen here in the United States.  It is also true, in my view, that the current high inflation in the United S tates is the product of strong demand and constrained supply, and  that t he Fed’s 
tools work principally on aggregate demand.  None of this diminishes the Federal Reserve’s responsibility to carry out our assigned task of achieving price stability.  T here 
is cle arly a job to do in moderating demand to better align with supply.  We are 
committed to doing that job.    
The second lesson is that the public’s expectations about future inflation can play 
an important role in setting the path of inflation over time.  To day, by many measures, 
longer -term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored.  That is broadly true 
of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, and of market -based measures as 
 
1 See Ben Bernanke (2004), “The Great Moderation,” speech delivered at the meetings of the Eastern 
Economic Association, Washington, February 20,  
https://www.federalreserve.gov /boarddocs/speeches/2004/20040220; Ben Bernanke (2022), “Inflation Isn’t 
Going to Bring Back the 1970s,” New York Times,  June 14.   - 4 - 
well.  But that is not grounds for complacency, with infl ation having run well above our 
goal for some time .      
If the public expects that inflation will remain low and stable over time, then, 
absent major shocks, it likely will.  Unfortunately, the same is true of expectations of 
high and volatile inflation.  During the 1970s, as inflation climbed, the anticipation of high inflation became entrenched in the economic decisionmaking of households and businesses.  The more inflation rose, the more people came to expect it to remain high, and they built that belie f into wage and pricing decisions.  As former Chairman Paul 
Volcker put it at the height of the Great Inflation in 1979, “Inflation feeds in part on itself, so part of the job of returning to a more stable and more productive economy must be to break the g rip of inflationary expectations.”
2 
One useful insight into how actual inflation may affect expectations about its 
future path is based in the concept of “rational inattention.”3  When inflation is 
persistently high, households and businesses must pay close attention and incorporate 
inflation into their economic decisions.  W hen inflation is low and stable , they are freer to 
focus their attention elsewhere.  Former Chairman Alan G reenspan put it this way:  “ For 
all practical purposes, price stability means that expected changes in the average price 
level are small enough and gradual enough that they do not materially enter business and 
household financial decisions.”4  
 
2 See Paul A. Volcker (1979 ), “Statement before the Joint Economic Committee of the U.S.  
Congress, October 17, 1979,” Federal Reserve Bulletin,  vol. 65 (November), p. 888, 
https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/federal- reserve- bulletin -62/november -1979- 20459.   
3 A review of the applic ations of rational inattention in monetary economics appears in Christopher A. Sims 
(2010), “Rational Inattention and Monetary Economics,” in Benjamin M. Friedman and Michael 
Woodford, eds., Handbook of Monetary Economics,  vol. 3 (Amsterdam:  North- Holland ), pp. 155– 81.  
4 See Alan Greenspan (1989), “Statement before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, 
U.S. Senate, February 21, 1989,” Federal Reserve Bulletin,  vol. 75 (April), pp. 274– 75, 
https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/federal- reserve- bulletin -62/april- 1989- 20803 .  - 5 - 
Of course, inflation has just about everyone’s attention right now, which 
highlights a particular risk today:  T he longer the current bout of high inflation continues, 
the greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become entrenched .    
That brings  me to the third lesson, which is that we must keep at it until the job is 
done.  History shows that the employment costs of bringing down inflation are likely to 
increase with delay, as high inflation becomes more entrenched in wage and price setting.  The successful Volcker disinflation in the early 1980s followed multiple failed attempts 
to lower inflation over the previous  15 years.  A lengthy period of very restrictive 
monetary policy was ultimately needed to stem the high inflation and start the proce ss of 
getting inflation down to the low and stable levels that were the norm until the spring of last year.  Our aim is to avoid that outcome by acting with resolve now.  
These lessons are guiding us as we use our tools to bring inflation down.  We are 
taking forceful and rapid steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment 
with supply, and to keep inflation expectations anchored.  We will keep at it until we are confident the job is done.

Opening Remarks  
 
 
 
by 
 
Jerome H. Powell  
 
Chair  
 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  
 
at a 
 
“Community Listening Session”   
a Fed Listens event at   
the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City

October 9, 2019 
  
Good morning.  I am happy to be here in Kansas City for the 13th of 14 Fed 
Listens event s.  I look forward to hearing the perspectives of the community and business 
leaders participating today.  
The Reserve Banks and the Board have been holding Fed Listens events around 
the country as part of a comprehensive and public review of our monetary policy 
strategy, tools, and communications practices.  Almost all of the Fed Listens meetings, 
like this one, have been open to the press and live -streamed on the i nternet.  Both the 
breadth and transparency of the review are unprecedented for us.   
One reason we are conducting this re view is that i t is always a good practice for 
any organization to occasionally take a step back and ask if it could be doing its job more 
effectively.  But we must pose that question not just to ourselves.  Because Congress has 
granted the Federal Reserve significant protections from short -term political pressures, 
we have an obligation to clearly explain what we are doing and why.  And we have an 
obligation to actively engage the people we serve so that they and their elected 
representatives can hold us accountable.  We  have invited you here because we want to 
better understand how monetary policy affects your lives and the lives of the people your 
organizations represent .  We want to hear your  perspective on maximum employment 
and price stability —the monetary policy goals Congress has assigned us .  
Now is a good time to conduct the review .  Unemployment is at  a half -century 
low, and inflation is running close to, but a bit below, our 2 percent objective.  While not 
everyone fully shares economic opportunities  and the economy faces some risks, overall , 
it is—as I like to say —in a good place.  Our job is to keep it there as long as possible.  
While we believe our strategy and tools have been and remain effective, the U.S.  - 2 - 
economy, l ike other advanced economies around the world, is facing some longer -term 
challenges —from low growth, low inflation, and low interest rates.  While slow growth is 
obviously not good, you may be asking, “What’s wrong with low inflation and low 
interest rate s?”  Low can be good, but when inflation—and, consequently, interest 
rates— are too low, the Fed and other central banks have less room to cut rates to support 
the economy during downturns.  
So, in this review, we are examining strategies that might better a llow us to 
symmetrically and sustainably achieve 2 percent inflation.  Doing so would help prevent 
inflation expectations among consumers, businesses, and investors from slipping too low, 
as they appear to have done in several advanced economies.  More- firmly anchored 
expectations, in a virtuous circle, would help keep actual inflation around our target, thus 
preserving our ability to change interest rates as appropriate to meet our mandate.  We are 
also looking at whether our existing monetary policy tools  will be adequate when the next 
downturn comes.  Finally, we are asking whether our communications practices can be 
improved to better support the effectiveness of our policy.  
After today, we have one  Fed Listens session remaining, later this month  in 
Chic ago.  At the July meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, my colleagues and 
I began discussing what we  have  learned so far from  the Fed Listens events .  We 
continued that discussion at our September meeting and have a lot left to do.  We plan to 
publicly report our conclusions during the first half of next year.  
One clear takeaway of the sessions so far is the importance of sustaining this 
historically strong job market.  People from low - and moderate -income communities tell 
us that this long recovery, now in its 11th  year, is benefiting them and their neighbors to a  - 3 - 
degree that has not been felt for many years.  Employers are partnering with community 
colleges and nonprofit organizations to offer training.  And people who have struggled to 
stay in  the workforce in the past are getting new opportunities.   
Once again, I’m happy to be here.  Now it is your turn to speak.  We’re listening.  ",2019-10-09,powell

Inflation and the Labor Market  
   
Remarks by  
 
Jerome H. Powell  
 
Chair  
 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  
 
at the  
 
Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy  
Brookings Institution 
 
Washington, D.C. 
       
November 30, 2022  
  
Today I will offer a progress report on the Federal Open Market Committee’s 
(FOMC ) efforts to restore price stability to the U.S. economy for the benefit of the 
American people.  The report  must  begin by acknowledging the reality that inflation 
remains far too high.  My colleagues and I are a cutely aware that high inflation is 
imposing significant hardship, straining budgets and shrinking what paychecks will buy.  
This is especially painful for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.  Price stability is the responsibility of the Fed eral 
Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy.  Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone.  In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.   
We currently estimate that 12 -month personal consumption expenditures (PCE) 
inflation through October ran at 6.0 percent (f igure 1).
1  While October inflation data 
received so far showed a welcome surprise to the downside, the se are a single month’s 
data, which followed upside surprises over the previous two months.  As figure 1 makes 
clear, down months in the data have often been followed by renewed increases.  It will 
take substantially more evidence to give comfort that inflation is actually declining.  By any standard, inflation remains much too high.  
For purposes of this discussion, I will focus my comments on core PCE i nflation, 
which omits the food and energy inflation components, which have been lower recently 
but are quite volatile.  Our inflation goal is for total inflation, of course, as food and 
energy prices matter a great deal for household budgets .  But core inflation often gives a 
more accurate indicator of where overall inflation is headed.  Twelve- month core  PCE  
 
1 Throughout this discussion, PCE data for October are estimates based on the October consumer price 
index and producer price index data.    - 2 - 
inflation stands at 5.0 percent in our October estimate, approximately where it stood last 
December when policy tightening was in its early stages.  Over 2022, core inflation rose a few tenths above 5 percent and fell a few tenths below, but it mainly moved sideways.  So when will inflation come down?   
I could answer this question by pointing to the inflation forecasts of private -sector 
forecasters or  of FOMC participants, which broadly show a significant decline over the 
next year.  But forecasts have been predicting just such a decline for more than a year, while inflation has moved stubbornly sideways.  The truth is that the path ahead for inflation  remains highly uncertain.  For now, let’s put aside the forecasts and look instead 
to the macroeconomic conditions we think we need to see to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time.   
For starters, we need to raise interest rates to a level that is s ufficiently restrictive 
to return inflation to 2 percent.  There is considerable uncertainty about what rate will be 
sufficient , although there is no doubt that we have made substantial progress, raising our 
target range for the federal funds rate by 3.75 percentage points since March.  As our last postmeeting statement indicates, we anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate.  It seems to me likely that the ultimate level of rates will need to be somewhat higher than thought at the time of the S eptember meeting and Summary of Economic Projections.  I 
will return to policy at the end of my comments, but for now , I will simply say that we 
have more ground to cover.  
We are tightening the stance of policy in order to slow growth in aggregate 
demand.  Slowing demand growth should allow supply to catch up with demand and  - 3 - 
restore the balance that will yield stable prices over time.  Restoring that balance is likely 
to require a sustained period of below -trend growth.     
Last year, the ongoing reopening of the economy boosted real gross domestic 
product ( GDP ) growth to a very strong 5.7 percent. This year , GDP was roughly flat 
through the first three quarters, and indicators point to modest growth this quarter, which seems likely to bring the year in wit h very modest growth overall.  Several factors 
contributed to this slowing growth, including the waning effects of reopening and of pandemic fiscal support, the global implications of Russia’s war against Ukraine, and our policy actions, which tightened fi nancial conditions and are affecting economic activity, 
particularly in interest- sensitive sectors such as housing.  We can say that demand growth 
has slowed, and we expect that this growth will need to remain at a slower pace for a sustained period.      
Despite the tighter policy and slower growth over the past year, we have not seen 
clear progress on slowing inflation.  To assess what it will take to get inflation down, it is useful to break core inflation into three component categories:  core goods inf lation, 
housing services inflation, and inflation in core services other than housing (figure 2).  
Core goods inflation has moved down from very high levels over the course of 
2022, while housing services inflation has risen rapidly.  Inflation in core ser vices ex  
housing has fluctuated but shown no clear trend.  I will discuss each of these items in 
turn.    
Early in the pandemic, goods prices began rising rapidly, as abnormally strong 
demand was met by pandemic -hampered supply.  Reports from businesses and many 
indicators suggest that supply chain issues are now easing .  Both fuel and nonfuel import  - 4 - 
prices have fallen in recent months, and indicators of prices paid by manufacturers have 
moved down.  While 12 -month core goods inflation remains elevated at 4.6 percent, it 
has fallen nearly 3 percentage points from earlier in the year.  It is far too early to dec lare 
goods inflation vanquished, but if current trends continue, goods prices should begin to exert downward pressure on overall inflation in coming months.  
Housing services inflation measures the rise in the price of all rents and the rise in 
the rental -equivalent cost of owner -occupied housing.  Unlike goods inflation, housing 
services inflation has continued to rise and now stands at 7.1 percent over the past 12 months.  Housing inflation tends to lag other prices around inflation turning points, however , because of the slow rate at which the stock of rental leases turns over.
2  The 
market rate on new leases is a timelier indicator of where overall housing inflation will 
go over the next year or so.  Measures of 12- month inflation in new leases rose to nearly 
20 percent during the pandemic but have been falling sharply since about midyear 
(figure  3).  
 As figure 3 shows, however, overall housing service s inflation has continued to 
rise as existing leases turn over and jump in price to catch up with the hi gher level of 
rents for new leases.  This is likely to continue well into  next year.  But as long as new 
lease inflation keeps falling, we would expect housing services inflation to begin falling 
sometime  next year.  Indeed, a decline in this inflation underlies most forecasts of 
declining inflation. 
Finally, we come to core services other than housing.  This spending category 
covers a wide range of services from health care and education to haircuts and 
 
2 Rental lease data are also the main input into the measurement of owner -occupied housing prices.   - 5 - 
hospitality.  This is the largest of our three categories, co nstituting more than half of the 
core PCE index.  Thus, this may be the most important category for understanding the 
future evolution of core inflation.  Because wages make up the largest cost in delivering these services, the labor market holds t he key to understanding inflation in this category.  
In the labor market, demand for workers far exceeds the supply of available 
workers, and nominal wages have been growing at a pace well above what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time.
3  Thus, another condition we are looking for 
is the restoration of balance between supply and demand in the labor market. 
Signs of elevated labor market tightness emerged suddenly in mid- 2021.  The 
unemployment rate at the time was much higher than the 3.5 percent that had prevailed without major signs of tightness before the pandemic.  Employment was still millions below its level on the eve of the pandemic.  Looking back, we can see that a significant and persistent labor supply shortfall opened up during the pandemic —a shortfall that 
appears unlikely to fully close anytime soon.   
Comparing the current labor force with the Congressional Budget Office’s pre -
pandemic forecast of labor force growth reveals a current labor force shortfall of roughly 3-1/2 mi llion people (figure 4, left panel ).
4  This shortfall reflects both lower -than-
expected population growth and a lower labor force participation rate (figure 4, right panel ).  Participation dropped sharply at the onset of the pandemic  because of  many 
factors , including sickness, caregiving, and fear of infection.  Many forecasters expected 
 
3 The pace of wage inflation affects all sectors of the economy, but wages are a particularly large share of 
costs in core services ex  housing and, thus, particularly important for inflation in this category.  
4 See Congressional Budget Office (2020).  To account for the eff ect of population controls on the level of 
the labor force, the shortfall is calculated by appending the Congressional Budget Office’s January 2020 
projected labor force growth over the years 2020– 22 onto the level of the labor force in 2019:Q4 that is 
adjusted for population controls.  
  - 6 - 
that participation would move back up fairly quickly as the pandemic faded.  And for 
workers in their prime working years, it mostly has.  Overall participatio n, however, 
remains well below pre -pandemic trends.  
Some of the participation gap reflects workers  who  are still out of the labor force  
because they are sick with COVID -19 or continue to suffer lingering symptoms from 
previous COVID infections (“long COVID”) .5  But recent research by Fed economists 
finds that the participation gap is now mostly due to excess retirements —that is, 
retirements in excess of what would have bee n expected from population aging alone.6  
These excess retirements might now account for more than 2 million of the 3- 1/2 million 
shortfall in the labor force.7   
What explains these excess retirements?  Health issues have  surely played a role, 
as COVID has posed a particularly large threat to the lives and health of the elderly.8  In 
addition, many older workers lost their jobs in the early stages of the pandemic , when 
layoffs were historically high.  The cost of finding new employment may have appeared particularly large for these workers , given pandemic -related disruptions to the work 
environment and health concerns .
9  Also, gains in the stock market and rising house 
 
5 Recent research suggests that long COVID may be keeping 280,000 to 680,000 individuals aged 16 to 64 
out of the labor force (Sheiner and Salwati , 2022), and long COVID may explain why the percent age of 
those aged 18 to 64 not in the labor force due to a disability has stalled over the past two years rather than 
continuing its pre -pandemic decline (see also Price,  2022).  
6 See Montes, Smith, and Dajon (2022).  
7 This analysis adjusts for population controls to the Current Population Survey.   This adjustment is 
important, because while the unadjusted data show a marked decline in the retired share in January 2022, 
this drop is entirely an artifact of new population controls introduced in January.   A proper assessment of 
the ef fects of retirements since the start of the pandemic needs to adjust the historical data for the effects of 
these population controls.  See Montes, Smith, and Dajon (2022).  
8 For example, see Goda and Soltas (2022).  
9 Displaced workers aged 65 and over had markedly lower reemployment rates and markedly higher rates 
of labor force exit than did similarly aged displaced workers in the years just before  the pandemic.  See 
Bureau of Labor Statistics (2022).   - 7 - 
prices in the first two years of the pandemic contributed to an increase in wealth that 
likely facilitated early retirement for some people.   
The data so far do not suggest that excess retirements are likely to unwind 
because of  retirees returning to the labor force.  O lder workers are still retiring at higher 
rates , and retirees do not a ppear to be returning to the labor force in sufficient numbers to 
meaningfully reduce the total number of excess retirees.10   
The second factor contributing to the labor supply shortfall is slower growth in 
the working- age population.  The combination of a plunge in net immigration and a surge 
in deaths during the pandemic probably accounts for about 1- 1/2 million missing 
workers.11   
Policies to support labor supply are not the domain of the Fed:  O ur tools work 
principally on demand.  Without advocating any particular policy, however, I will say that policies to support labor force participation could, over time, bring benefits to the 
 
10 Among those 55 and over, transitions into retirement are currently well above the average rate in the 
three years before the pandemic (after adjusting for population controls).  At the same time, retirees are 
returning to the labor force at a rate similar to that before  the pandemic.  
11 First,  due primarily to COVID, mortality over the past few years has far exceeded what had been  
expected before  the pandemic.  This channel accounts for about 400,000 of the labor force shortfall.   Total 
deaths due to COVID are much larger —about 1 million people.  However, the effect on the labor force is 
smaller than this because COVID deaths have mostly been among older people, who participate in the labor 
force at lower rates than younger people.  
Second, due, at least in part, to pandemic- related restrictions on entry into the United States, total 
immigration has slowed substantially since the start of the pandemic, lowering the labor force by about 
1 million people relative to pre -pandemic trends .  While lawful, nonpermanent immigration ( for example,  
H-1B and H -2B visa holders) has bounced back considerably since earlier in the pandemic, these categories 
of immigration are generally still below 2019 levels.  Meanwhile, lawful permanent immigration ( that is,  
new green card holders) is also somewhat lower than in 2019 and well below levels that prevailed earlier in the 2010s.  Regarding undocumented immigration, while migrant encounters at the U.S. –Mexico border 
have been high lately, some estimates suggest the number of undocumented immigrants in the U nited 
States is not much different than in 2019.  (For data on legal immigration, see U.S. Department of 
Homeland Security, 2022; for data on border encounters, see U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 2022; 
for estimates of the number of  undocumented immigrants, see Camarota and Zeigler, 2022.)

workers  who join the labor force  and support overall economic growth.  Such policies 
would take time to implement and have  their effects, however.  For the near term, a 
moderation of labor demand growth will be required to restore balance to the labor 
market.    
Currently, the unemployment rate is at 3.7 percent, near 50- year lows, and job 
openings exceed available workers by about 4 million —that is about 1.7 job openings for 
every person looking for work (figure 5).  So far, we have seen only tentative signs of moderation of labor demand.  With slower GDP growth this year, job gains have stepped down from more than 450,000 pe r month over the first seven months of the year to about 
290,000 per month over the past three months.  But this job growth remains far in excess of the pace needed to accommodate population growth over time —about 100,000 per 
month by many estimates.  Job openings have fallen by about 1.5 million this year but remain higher than at any time before the pandemic.    
Wage growth , too, shows only tentative signs of returning to balance.  Some 
measures of wage growth have ticked down recently (figure 6).  But the declines are very modest so far relative to earlier increases and still leave wage growth well above levels consistent with 2 percent inflation over time.  To be clear, strong wage growth  is a good 
thing.  But for wage growth to be sustainable, it needs to be consistent with 2 percent inflation.  
  Let’s sum up this review of economic conditions that we think we need to see to 
bring inflation down to 2 percent.  Growth in economic activity has slowed to well below 
its longer -run trend, and this needs to be sustained.  Bottlenecks in goods production are 
easing and goods price inflation appears to be easing as well, and this , too, m ust continue.   - 9 - 
Housing services inflation will probably keep rising well into next year, but if inflation 
on new leases continues to fall, we will likely see housing services inflation begin to fall later next year.  Finally, the labor market, which is especially important for inflation in core services ex  housing, shows only tentative signs of rebalancing, and wage growth 
remains well above levels that would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time.  Despite some promising developments, we have a l ong way to go in restoring price 
stability .   
Returning to monetary policy, my FOMC colleagues and I are strongly committed 
to restoring price stability.  After our November meeting, we noted that we anticipated that ongoing rate increases will be appropri ate in order to attain a policy stance that is 
sufficiently restrictive to move inflation down to 2  percent  over time.   
Monetary policy affects the economy and inflation  with uncertain lags, and the 
full effects of our rapid tightening so far are yet to be felt.  Thus, it makes sense to 
moderate the pace of our rate increases as we approach the level of restraint that will be sufficient to bring inflation down.  The time for moderating the pace of rate increases may come as soon as the December meeting.  G iven our progress in tightening policy, the 
timing of that moderation is far less significant than the questions of how much further we will need to raise rates to control inflation, and the length of time it will be necessary to hold policy at a restrictive level.  It is likely that restoring price stability will require holding policy at a restrictive level for some time.  History cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy.  We will stay the course until the job is done.    - 10 -

“Revisiting Monetary Policy in a Low-Inflation Environment” 
 
a Conference Sponsored by the Fe deral Reserve Bank of Boston 
 
Boston, Massachusetts 
       
October 15, 2010  
The topic of this conference--the formul ation and conduct of monetary policy in a 
low-inflation environment--is timely indeed.  From the late 1960s un til a decade or so 
ago, bringing inflation under control was view ed as the greatest ch allenge facing central 
banks around the world.  Through the appl ication of improved policy frameworks, 
involving both greater transparency and incr eased independence from short-term political 
influences, as well as through continued focus and persistence, central banks have largely 
achieved that goal.  In turn, the progress ag ainst inflation increased the stability and 
predictability of the economic environmen t and thus contribute d significantly to 
improvements in economic performance, not l east in many emerging market nations that 
in previous eras had suffered bouts of very  high inflation.  Moreover, success greatly 
enhanced the credibility of central banks ’ commitment to price stability, and that 
credibility further supported st ability and confidence.  Retaining that credibility is of 
utmost importance.   
Although the attainment of price stability after a period of hi gher inflation was a 
landmark achievement, monetary policymaking in  an era of low inflation has not proved 
to be entirely straightforward.  In the 1980s and 1990s, few ever questioned the desired 
direction for inflation; lower was always be tter.  During those year s, the key questions 
related to tactics:  How quickly should infl ation be reduced?  Shoul d the central bank be 
proactive or “opportunistic” in reducing inflation?  As averag e inflation levels declined, 
however, the issues became more complex.  The statement of the Federal Open Market 
Committee (FOMC) following its May 2003 mee ting was something of a watershed, in 
that it noted that, in the Comm ittee’s view, further disinflati on would be “unwelcome.”  
In other words, the risks to pr ice stability had become two-side d:  With inflation close to - 2 - 
 
 
 levels consistent with price stability, centr al banks, for the first time in many decades, 
had to take seriously the possibility that in flation can be too low as well as too high. 
A second complication for policymaking crea ted by low inflation arises from the 
fact that low inflation generally implies low nominal interest rates, which increase the 
potential relevance for policymaking of the zero lower bound on interest rates.  Because 
the short-term policy interest rate cannot be reduced below zero, the Federal Reserve and 
central banks in other countri es have employed nonstandard policies and approaches that 
do not rely on reductions in the short-term in terest rate.  We are still learning about the 
efficacy and appropriate management  of these alternative tools. 
In the remainder of my remarks I will discuss these issues in the context of 
current economic and policy developments.  I will comment on the near-term outlook for economic activity and inflation.  I will then compare that outlook to some quantitative 
measures of the Federal Reserve’s object ives, namely, the longer-run outcomes that 
FOMC participants judge to be most cons istent with its dual mandate of maximum 
employment and price stability.  Finally, I will observe that, in a world in which the 
policy interest rate is close to zero, the Committee must consider the costs and risks 
associated with the use of nonconventional tools when it assesses whether additional 
policy accommodation is likely to be beneficial on net. 
The Outlook for Growth and Employment 
The arbiters across the river in Cambri dge, the business cycl e dating committee of 
the National Bureau of Economic Research, r ecently made their determination:  An 
economic recovery began in the United States in July 2009, following a series of forceful 
actions by central banks and other policymak ers around the world that  helped stabilize - 3 - 
 
 
 the financial system and restore more-normal functioning to key financial markets.  The 
initial upturn in activity, which was reas onably strong, reflected a number of factors, 
including efforts by firms to be tter align their inventories wi th their sales, expansionary 
monetary and fiscal policies, improved financial conditions, and a pickup in export 
growth.  However, factors such as fiscal po licy and the inventory cycle can provide only 
a temporary impetus to recovery.  Sustained expansion must ultimately be driven by growth in private final demand, including c onsumer spending, business and residential 
investment, and net exports.  That handoff is  currently under way.  However, with growth 
in private final demand having so far prove d relatively modest, overall economic growth 
has been proceeding at a pace that is  less vigorous than we would like. 
In particular, consumer spending has been inhibited by the painfully slow 
recovery in the labor market, which has restra ined growth in wage income and has raised 
uncertainty about job security  and employment prospects.  Since June, private-sector 
employers have added, on net, an average of only about 85,000 workers per month--not 
enough to bring the unemploymen t rate down significantly.  
Consumer spending in the quarters ahead  will depend importantly on the pace of 
job creation but also on househol ds’ ability to repair their financial positions.  Some 
progress is being made on this front.  Savi ng rates are up noticeably from pre-crisis 
levels, and household assets have risen, on net,  over recent quarters, while debt and debt 
service payments have declined markedly relative to income.
1  Together with expected 
further easing in credit term s and conditions offered by lenders, stronger balance sheets 
should eventually provide households the c onfidence and the wherewithal to increase 
                                                 
1 Some of the reduction in household debt burdens is the result of defaults and writedowns rather than 
higher saving. - 4 - 
 
 
 their pace of spending.  That said, progress has been and is likely to be uneven, as the 
process of balance sheet repair remain s impeded to some extent by elevated 
unemployment, lower home values, and limited ab ility to refinance ex isting mortgages.   
Household finances and att itudes also have an importa nt influence on the housing 
market, which has remained depressed, notw ithstanding reduced house prices and record-
low mortgage rates.  The overhang of for eclosed properties and vacant homes remains a 
significant drag on house prices and residential investment. 
In the business sector, indicators such as new orders and business sentiment 
suggest that growth in spe nding on equipment and software has slowed relative to its 
rapid pace earlier this year.  Investment in non residential structures continues to contract, 
reflecting stringent financing conditions and high vacancy rates for commercial real 
estate.  The availability of  credit to finance investment  and expand business operations 
remains quite uneven:  Generally speaking, large firms in good financial condition can 
obtain credit in capital markets easily and on favorable terms.  Larger firms also hold 
considerable amounts of cash on their balance sh eets.  By contrast, surveys and anecdotes 
indicate that bank-dependent smaller firms c ontinue to face significantly greater problems 
in obtaining credit, reflecting in  part weaker balance sheets  and income prospects that 
limit their ability to qualify for loans as we ll as tight lending sta ndards and terms on the 
part of banks.  The Federal Reserve and other banking regulators have been making 
significant efforts to improve the credit envi ronment for small businesses, and we have 
seen some positive signs.  In particular, banks are no longer tighten ing lending standards 
and terms and are reportedly becoming more  proactive in seeking out creditworthy 
borrowers. - 5 - 
 
 
 Although the pace of recovery has slowed in recent months and is likely to 
continue to be fairly modest  in the near term, the precondi tions for a pickup in growth 
next year remain in place.  Stronger hous ehold finances, a further easing of credit 
conditions, and pent-up demand for consumer durable goods should al l contribute to a 
somewhat faster pace of household spendi ng.  Similarly, business investment in 
equipment and software should grow at a r easonably rapid pace next year, driven by 
rising sales, an ongoing need to replace obsolet e or worn-out equipment, strong corporate 
balance sheets, and low financing costs.  In th e public sector, the tax receipts of state and 
local governments have started to recover, which should allow their spending to stabilize 
gradually.  The contribution of federal fiscal stimulus to over all growth is expected to 
decline steadily over coming quarters but not so  quickly as to derail the recovery.  
Continued solid expansion among the economies of  our trading partners should also help 
to support foreign sales and gr owth in the United States.  
Although output growth should be somewhat  stronger in 2011 than it has been 
recently, growth next year seems unlikely to be  much above its longer-term trend.  If so, 
then net job creation may not exceed by much th e increase in the size of the labor force, 
implying that the unemployment rate will decline only slowly.  That prospect is of central 
concern to economic policymakers, because  high rates of unemployment--especially 
longer-term unemployment--impose a very heavy burden on the unemployed and their 
families.  More broadly, prolonged high unemployment would pose a risk to consumer spending and hence to the sustai nability of the recovery.   - 6 - 
 
 
 The Outlook for Inflation 
Let me turn now to the outlook for infl ation.  Generally speaking, measures of 
underlying inflation have been trending downw ard.  For example, so-called core PCE 
price inflation (which is ba sed on the broad-based price i ndex for personal consumption 
expenditures and excludes the volatile food and energy components of the overall index) 
has declined from approximately 2.5 percent at an annual rate in the early stages of the 
recession to an annual rate of about 1.1 percent over the first eight months of this year.  
The overall PCE price inflati on rate, which includes food and energy prices, has been 
highly volatile in the past few years, in larg e part because of sharp fluctuations in oil 
prices.  However, so far this year the overall inflation rate has been about the same as the 
core inflation rate.   
The significant moderation in price incr eases has been widespread across many 
categories of spending, as is evident from various measures that exclude the most 
extreme price movements in each period.  For example, the so-called trimmed mean 
consumer price index (CPI) has risen by onl y 0.9 percent over the past 12 months, and a 
related measure, the median CPI, has in creased by only 0.5 percent over the same 
period.2 
The decline in underlying inflation importan tly reflects the extent to which cost 
pressures have been restrained by substant ial slack in the utilization of productive 
resources.  Notably, the unemployment rate remains fairly close to last fall’s peak and is 
                                                 
2 Trimmed-mean and median CPI measures are published regularly by the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Cleveland; these indicators are co nstructed using the distribution of monthly price changes for the 
disaggregated components of the CPI.  The median CPI inflation rate is the price change at the center of 
this distribution, and the trimmed-mean CPI inflation rate is a weighted average of all components excluding the most extreme price increases an d decreases.  For further information, see 
www.clevelandfed.org/research/data/u s-inflation/chartsdata/index.cfm. - 7 - 
 
 
 currently about 5 percentage poi nts above the rates that preva iled just before the onset of 
the financial crisis.  
In gauging the magnitude of prevailing res ource slack and the associated restraint 
on price and wage increases, it is essential to  consider the extent to which structural 
factors may be contributing to elevated ra tes of unemployment.  For example, the 
continuing high level of permanent job losers may be a sign that structural impediments--
such as barriers to worker mobility or mism atches between the skills that workers have 
and the ones that employers require--are hi ndering unemployed individuals from finding 
new jobs.  The recent behavior of unemployment and job vacancies--somewhat more vacancies are reported than would usually be  the case given the number of people looking 
for work--is also suggestive of some increase in the level of structural unemployment.  
On the other hand, we see little evidence that the reallocation of work ers across industries 
and regions is particularly pronounced relativ e to other periods of recession, suggesting 
that the pace of structural change is not greater than normal.  Moreover, previous post-
World-War-II recessions do not seem to have re sulted in higher structural unemployment, 
which many economists attribute to the relative flexibility of the U.S. labor market.  Overall, my assessment is that the bulk of the increase in une mployment since the 
recession began is attributable to the sharp c ontraction in economic activity that occurred 
in the wake of the financial crisis and the continuing shortfall of aggregate demand since 
then, rather than to  structural factors.

3 Recent empirical studies assessing th e magnitude of shifts in the sust ainable rate of unemployment--the 
portion of unemployment not attributable to temporary cyclical factors--include Barnichon and Figura (2010), Dickens (2009), Dowling, Estevão, and Tsounta (2010), Fleischman and Roberts (2010), Fujita 
(2010), Lindner and Tasci (2010), and Kuang and Valletta (2010). - 8 - 
 
 
 The public’s expectations for inflation also importantly influence inflation 
dynamics.  Indicators of longer-term inflation ex pectations have genera lly been stable in 
the wake of the financial crisis.  For ex ample, in the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Philadelphia’s Survey of Professional Forecas ters, the median projection for the annual 
average inflation rate for pe rsonal consumption expenditure s over the next 10 years has 
remained close to 2 percent.  Surveys of  households likewise s how that longer-term 
inflation expectations have been  relatively stable.  In the financial markets, measures of 
inflation compensation at longe r horizons (computed from th e spread between yields on 
nominal and inflation-indexed Treasury securi ties) have moved down, on net, this year 
but remain within their historic al ranges.  With long-run infl ation expectations stable and 
with substantial resource slack continuing to restrain cost pressures, it seems likely that inflation trends will remain subdued for some time. 
The Objectives of Monetary Policy 
To evaluate policy alternatives and e xplain policy choices to the public, it is 
essential not only to forecast the economy, but to compare that forecast to the objectives 
of policy.  Clear communication about the l onger-run objectives of monetary policy is 
beneficial at all times but is particularly im portant in a time of low inflation and uncertain 
economic prospects such as the present.  Improving the public’s understanding of the 
central bank’s policy strategy reduces econom ic and financial uncertainty and helps 
households and firms make more-informed deci sions.  Moreover, clar ity about goals and 
strategies can help anchor the public’s longer- term inflation expecta tions more firmly and 
thereby bolsters the central bank’s ability to respond for cefully to adverse shocks.

 The Federal Reserve has a statutory manda te to foster maximum employment and 
price stability, and explaining how we are work ing toward those goals plays a crucial role 
in our monetary policy strategy.  It is eviden t that neither of our dual objectives can be 
taken in isolation:  On the one hand, a centr al bank that aimed to achieve the highest 
possible level of employment in the short r un, without regard to other considerations, 
might well generate unacceptable levels of in flation without any permanent benefits in 
terms of employment.  On the other hand, a single-minded focus by the central bank on 
price stability, with no attention at all to ot her factors, could lead  to more frequent and 
deeper slumps in economic activity and employ ment with little benefit in terms of long-
run inflation performance.   
Recognizing the interacti ons between the two parts of our mandate, the FOMC 
has found it useful to frame our dual mandate in terms of the longer-run sustainable rate 
of unemployment and the mandate-consistent inflation rate .  The longer-run sustainable 
rate of unemployment is the rate of une mployment that the economy can maintain 
without generating upward or downward pre ssure on inflation.  Because a healthy 
economy must allow for the destruction and crea tion of jobs, as well as for movements of 
workers between jobs and in and out of the la bor force, the longer-run sustainable rate of 
unemployment is greater than zero.  Similarly, the mandate-consistent inflation rate--the inflation rate that best promotes our dual objectives in the long run--is not necessarily 
zero; indeed, Committee participants have generally judged that a modestly positive inflation rate over the longer run is most c onsistent with the dual mandate.  (The view 
that policy should aim for an in flation rate modestly above ze ro is shared by virtually all 
central banks around the world.)  Several rati onales can be provided for this judgment, - 10 - 
 
 
 including upward biases in the measurement of inflation.  A rationale that is particularly 
relevant today is that maintaining an “inflati on buffer” (that is, an average inflation rate 
greater than zero) allows for a somewhat highe r average level of nominal interest rates, 
which in turn gives the Federal Reserve greater  latitude to reduce th e target federal funds 
rate when needed to stimul ate increased economic activity and employment.  A modestly 
positive inflation rate also reduces the proba bility that the economy could fall into 
deflation, which under some circumstances can  lead to significant economic problems. 
Although attaining the long-run sustainabl e rate of unemployment and achieving 
the mandate-consistent rate of inflation ar e both key objectives of  monetary policy, the 
two objectives are somewhat different in na ture.  Most importantly, whereas monetary 
policymakers clearly have the ab ility to determine the inflatio n rate in the long run, they 
have little or no control ov er the longer-run sustainable unemployment rate, which is 
primarily determined by demographic and stru ctural factors, not by monetary policy.  
Thus, while central bankers can choose the value of inflati on they wish to target, the 
sustainable unemployment rate can only be estimated, and is subject to substantial 
uncertainty.  Moreover, the sustainable rate of unemployment typica lly evolves over time 
as its fundamental determinants change, wher eas keeping inflation expectations firmly 
anchored generally implies that the infla tion objective should remain constant unless 
there are compelling technical reasons for ch anging it, such as changes in the methods 
used to measure inflation. 
In recent years, the Federal Reserve ha s taken important steps to more clearly 
communicate its outlook and longer-run objectiv es.  Since the fall of 2007, the Federal 
Reserve has been publishing the “Summary of  Economic Projections” (SEP) four times a - 11 - 
 
 
 year in conjunction with the FOMC minutes.  The SEP provides summary statistics and 
an accompanying narrative regarding the project ions of FOMC participants--that is, the 
Board members and the Reserve Bank presiden ts--for the growth ra te of real gross 
domestic product (GDP), the unemployment ra te, core inflation, a nd headline inflation 
over the next several calendar years.  Since early 2009, the SEP has also included 
information about FOMC partic ipants’ longer-run projections  for the rates of economic 
growth, unemployment, and inflation to whic h the economy is expected to converge over 
time, in the absence of further shocks a nd under appropriate monetary policy.  Because 
appropriate monetary policy, by definition, is  aimed at achieving the Federal Reserve’s 
objectives in the longer run, FOMC participants’ longer-run projections for economic 
growth, unemployment, and inflation may be in terpreted, respectively, as estimates of the 
economy’s longer-run potential growth rate , the longer-run sustainable rate of 
unemployment, and the mandate-cons istent rate of inflation.   
The most recent release of the SEP was in June, and I will refer to those 
projections here, noting that ne w projections will be released with the minutes of the next 
FOMC meeting, in early November.   
The longer-run inflation proj ections in the SEP indicate that FOMC participants 
generally judge the mandate-consiste nt inflation rate to be about  2 percent or a bit below.  
In contrast, as I noted earlier, recent readings on underlying inflation have been 
approximately 1 percent.  Thus, in effect , inflation is running at rates that are too low  
relative to the levels that the Committee judges to be mo st consistent with the Federal 
Reserve’s dual mandate in the longer run.  In particular, at current rates of inflation, the 
constraint imposed by the zero lower bound on no minal interest rates is too tight (the - 12 - 
 
 
 short-term real interest rate is too high, gi ven the state of the economy), and the risk of 
deflation is higher than desira ble.  Given that monetary policy works with a lag, the more 
relevant question is whether this situation is fo recast to continue.  In  light of the recent 
decline in inflation, the degree of slack in  the economy, and the relative stability of 
inflation expectations, it is reasonable to fo recast that underlying inflation--setting aside 
the inevitable short-run volatility--will be le ss than the mandate-consistent inflation rate 
for some time.  Of course, forecasts of infl ation, as of other key economic variables, are 
uncertain and must be re gularly updated with the a rrival of new information. 
As of June, the longer-run unemployment projections in the SEP had a central 
tendency of about 5 to 5-1/4 percent--about 1/4 percentage point higher than a year 
earlier--and a couple of partic ipants’ projections were ev en higher at around 6 to 
6-1/4 percent.  The evolution of these projec tions and the diversity of views reflect the 
characteristics that I noted ear lier:  The sustainable rate of unemployment may vary over 
time, and estimates of its value are subject to considerable uncertaint y.  Nonetheless, with 
an actual unemployment rate of nearly  10 percent, unemployment is clearly too high  
relative to estimates of its sustainable rate.  Moreover, with output growth over the next 
year expected to be only modestly above  its longer-term trend, high unemployment is 
currently forecast to persist for some time.  
Monetary Policy Tools:  Benefits and Costs 
Given the Committee’s objectives, there woul d appear--all else be ing equal--to be 
a case for further action.  However, as I indi cated earlier, one of th e implications of a 
low-inflation environment is that policy is more  likely to be constrained by the fact that 
nominal interest rates cannot be reduced below zero.  Indeed, the Federal Reserve - 13 - 
 
 
 reduced its target for the federal funds rate to a range of 0 to 25 basis points almost two 
years ago, in December 2008.  Further policy accommodation is certa inly possible even 
with the overnight interest rate at zero, but nonconventi onal policies have costs and 
limitations that must be taken into account in  judging whether and how  aggressively they 
should be used.  
For example, a means of providing additional monetary stimulus, if warranted, 
would be to expand the Federal Reserve’ s holdings of longer-term securities.5  Empirical 
evidence suggests that our previous program of securities purchases was successful in 
bringing down longer-term interest rates a nd thereby supporting the economic recovery.6  
A similar program conducted by the Bank of En gland also appears to have had benefits. 
However, possible costs must be wei ghed against the potential benefits of 
nonconventional policies.  One disadvantage of  asset purchases relative to conventional 
monetary policy is that we have much less ex perience in judging the economic effects of 
this policy instrument, which makes it challe nging to determine the appropriate quantity 
and pace of purchases and to communicate this  policy response to the public.  These 
factors have dictated that the FOMC proceed  with some caution in deciding whether to 
engage in further purchases of longer-term securities.  
Another concern associated with additional securities purchases is that substantial 
further expansion of the bala nce sheet could reduce public co nfidence in the Fed’s ability 
to execute a smooth exit from its accommodative policies at the appropriate time.  Even if 
unjustified, such a reduction in confidence might lead to an undesired increase in 
inflation expectations, to a level above the Committee’s inflation objective.  To address

 such concerns and to ensure that it can withdraw monetary accommodation smoothly at 
the appropriate time, the Federal Reserv e has developed an array of new tools.7  With 
these tools in hand, I am confident that th e FOMC will be able to tighten monetary 
conditions when warranted, even if the balan ce sheet remains considerably larger than 
normal at that time. 
Central bank communication provides addi tional means of increasing the degree 
of policy accommodation when short-term no minal interest rates are near zero.  For 
example, FOMC postmeeting statements ha ve included forward policy guidance since 
December 2008, and the most recent statements  have reflected the FOMC’s anticipation 
that exceptionally low levels of the federal f unds rate are likely to be warranted “for an 
extended period,” contingent on economic conditions.  A step the Committee could 
consider, if conditions called fo r it, would be to modify the language of the statement in 
some way that indicates that the Committee expects to keep the target for the federal 
funds rate low for longer than markets expect .  Such a change would presumably lower 
longer-term rates by an amount re lated to the revisi on in policy expectations.  A potential 
drawback of using the FOMC’s statement in this way is that, at least without a more 
comprehensive framework in place, it may be  difficult to convey the Committee’s policy 
intentions with sufficient precision and c onditionality.  The Committee will continue to 
actively review its communicati ons strategy with the goal of providing as much clarity as 
possible about its outlook, policy ob jectives, and policy strategies. 
Conclusion 
In short, there are clearly many ch allenges in communi cating and conducting 
monetary policy in a low-infl ation environment, including th e uncertainties associated

 with the use of nonconventiona l policy tools.  Despite these challenges, the Federal 
Reserve remains committed to pursuing policies that promote our dual objectives of maximum employment and price stability.  In  particular, the FOMC is prepared to 
provide additional accommodation if needed to support the economic recovery and to return inflation over time to levels cons istent with our mandate.  Of course, in 
considering possible further ac tions, the FOMC will take acc ount of the potential costs 
and risks of nonconventional policies, and, as always, the Committee’s actions are 
contingent on incoming information about the economic outlook and financial conditions.

I am pleased to join you for the eighth biennial Federal Reserve System 
Community Affairs Research Conferen ce.  The work you are doing here --sharing 
research and exchanging ideas on how best to further the development of low -income 
communities --is vitally important.   
As this year’s theme , “Resilience and Rebuilding ,” reflects, low -income 
communities were  particularly hard hit by the Great Recession.1  And, while employment 
and housing show signs of improving for the nation as a whole, conditions in lower -
income neighborhoods remain difficult by many measures.  For example, an analysis by 
Federal Reserve staff r eveals that long -vacant housing units tend to be concentrated in a 
small numb er of neighborhoods that also tend to have high unemployment rates, low 
educational l evels, and low median incomes.2  While some of these neighborhoods are in 
the inner cities, ot hers are in suburb s.   
This analysis and others like it illustrate the close interconnections of housing 
conditions, educational levels, and unemployment experience within neighborhoods.  
Moreover, as this work confirms, poverty is no longer primarily an u rban phenomenon 
but has increasingly spread to suburban areas, many of which lack the social and 
community development services needed to mitigate poverty and its effects.3  The 
implications of these trends for community development are profound.  Successf ul 
                                                 
1 For example, t he Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) data show that the average wealth of individuals in 
low- and moderate -income areas declined on a percentage basis more than that in higher -income areas 
(21 percent versus 17 percent).  See the 2007 -09 SCF panel data, available at

strategies to rebuild communities cannot focus narrowly on a single problem , such as the 
physical deterioration of neighborhoods that suffered high rates of foreclosure .  Rather, 
progress will require multipronged approaches that address housing, educat ion, jobs, and 
quality -of-life issues in a coherent, mutually consistent way.  Moreover, strategies will 
have to be adapted to meet the special circumstances of urban, suburban, and rural 
settings.  As community development researchers and practitioners, y ou are confronting 
the challenge of effectively attending to the needs of both individuals and communities --
of people as well as places.  
The Evolution of Community Development  
Community development has a long history of innovation and learning from 
experience.  Notably, after decades of large -scale, top -down federal efforts, it became 
increasingly apparent that a one -size-fits-all approach did not serve local communities 
well.  The urban renewal programs of the 1950s and 1960s were perhaps the most 
prominent examples of well -meaning but misguided efforts to revitalize decaying inner -
city neighborhoods.  In practice, these policies often devastated neighborhood cohesion, 
leading their critics to argue for local, bottom -up solutions.  Perhaps the most i nfluential 
critique of urban renewal and top -down planning was Jane Jacobs’ s 1961 book, Death 
and Life of Great American Cities .4  In that book  she celebrated the complexity and 
organic development of city neighborhoods in which intricate social networks e nhance 
safety, quality of life, and economic opportunity.  In Jacobs’ s view, a police force was 
not as effective at maintaining order as a neighborhood filled with “public actors” such as 
storekeepers, doormen, and interested neighbors acting as street wat chers at all hours.  
The development of this sort of community self -monitoring is most likely to emerge, she

argued, in neighborhoods with a rich mixture of activities taking place in buildings of 
varying age, character, and use.  
For the most part, social  science research has vindicated Jacobs’ s perspective.  
For example, sociologists studying community resilience in the wake of natural disasters 
mapped deaths caused by an extreme heat wave in Chicago in 1995.5  They found, not 
surprisingly, that death rat es were higher in poor areas where air conditioners were 
scarce.  But they also noticed a remarkable difference in the fatality rate in two adjacent 
neighborhoods --Englewood and Auburn Grisham --on Chicago’s South Side.  These 
neighborhoods were comparable by many measures :  Both were 99 percent African  
American, with similar numbers of elderly residents and comparably high rates of 
poverty  and unemployment.  Yet Englewood experienced 33 deaths per 100,000 residents 
during the heat wave , while Auburn Grisham  had among the lowest fatality rates in the 
city, 3 deaths per 100,000 residents.  Researchers found that a key difference between 
Auburn Grisham and other neighborhoods lay in its physical and social topography --the 
vitality of its sidewalks, stores, rest aurants, and community organizations that brought 
friends and neighbors together, making it easier for people to look out for each other.   
This example illustrates a point that many community development practitioners 
have come to embrace:  Resilient commu nities require more than decent housing , 
important as that is ; they require a n array of amenities that support the social fabric of the 
community and build the capabilities of community residents.  The movement toward a 
holistic approach to community devel opment has been long in the making, but the 
housing crisis has motivated further progress.  To be sure, implementing a holistic 
approach is easier said than done.  Government resources are still largely managed in

silos, and coordinating government agencie s, philanthropy, and the private sector to meet 
the needs of local communities requires extraordinary commitment and effective 
leadership.  But persistence and effort pay off .  The holistic approach has the power to 
transform neighborhoods and, as a result , the lives of their lower -income residents.  
Let me give another example, drawn from the experience of the East Lake 
neighborhood in Atlanta, a neighborhood that exemplified the effects of concentrated 
poverty.  In the early 1990s, East Lake had a crime r ate 18 times higher than the national 
average.  Nearly 60 percent of adults received public assistance , and o nly 5 percent of 
fifth grade children were able to meet state academic performance standards.  A local 
philanthropist, Tom Cousins, wanted to impro ve the quality of life in this neighborhood 
by de -concentrating its poverty.6  But he understood that East Lake’s problems were 
interconnected:  Replacing substa ndard housing would do little to attract families to the 
neighborhood if it lacked good schools , but schools couldn’t perform well if students 
feared for their safety, arrived hungry, and were otherwise unprepared or unable to learn.  
High dropout rates in turn fueled the neighborhood’s high rates of unemployment and 
crime.  
To deal with the intercon nectedness of the neighborhood’s problems, Cousins 
determined to attack them simultaneously.  He created the East Lake Foundation to 
facilitate transformative change.  The foundation partnered with the Atlanta Housing 
Authority to replace the neighborhood’ s low -income housing project with mixed -income 
housing that accommodated former tenants and other very low -income residents as well

Neighborhood Transformation,” in Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and Low Income Investment 
Fund, Investing in What Works for America’s Communities:  Essays on People, Place, and Purpose  (San 
Francisco:  FRBSF and LIIF), pp. 170 -83, www.whatworksforamerica.org/pdf/franklin.pdf.   - 5 - 
as attracting new, higher -income families.  An independently operated public charter 
school for grades kindergarten through 12, named  the Drew Charter School,  and an early 
learning center serving 135  children were built.  A new YMCA health and fitness center 
began to provide wellness programs and to serve as a neighborhood gathering place.  
Finally, the foundation worked to att ract commercial investments in the neighborhood, 
including a grocery store, a bank branch, and restaurants.  
Creating this plan and navigating the complex array of interests and resources of 
the community, the local government, and the private sector took 10 years of effort.  But 
the character of the neighborhood was fundamentally changed.  Today crime in East Lake 
is down by 73 percent, and violent crime is down by 90 percent.  The percentage of low -
income adults employed has increased from 13 percent to 7 0 percent, and Drew Charter 
School moved from last place in performance among 69 Atlanta public schools after its 
first year of operation to fourth place.  With 74 percent of its students receiving free and 
reduced -price lunches, Drew performs at the same level as public schools in far more 
affluent areas.7  The educational outcomes alone argue for the wisdom of the holistic 
approach to commun ity development.   
The success in East Lake raises the question of whether a similar approach can 
work in other communities.  In 2009, Cousins launched a community development 
organization, Purpose Built Communities, to try to attain the same good outcomes  that 
were achieved in Atlanta in other cities around the country.  Experience so far suggests 
that, while the framework can be replica ted, it requires certain neighborhood conditions 
to succeed.  These conditions include (1) housing developments of concen trated poverty,

note 6.  - 6 - 
which can feasibly be replaced by good -quality mixed -income housing at sufficient scale 
to change the housing and income characteristics of the neighborhood; (2) the 
opportunity to create one or more schools accountable to parents and the c ommunity; and 
(3) civic and business leadership that is prepared to create and support an organization 
charged with coordinating the necessary partnerships and seeing through the long -term 
plans.   
As those involved in this effort note, the P urpose  Built s trategy is quite different 
from that of most other bodies whose decisions affect community development.8  For 
example, city governments rarely organize around neighborhoods.  School boards, 
housing authorities, and transit systems all make decisions critic al to the health of 
neighborhoods, but they generally act independently of city government.  Moreover, the 
goals of such bodies are not typically measured in terms of the health of neighborhoods 
in any holistic sense.  
This mindset may be changing, however.   For example, Los Angeles recently 
adopted a community -based approach to strategic planning.  Its five -year consolidated 
plan recognizes that no single program or effort is likely, on its own, to lift families out of 
poverty or reduce crime in a neighborh ood.  Rather, the plan calls for a multifaceted 
approach to “build healthy communities by integrating community, economic, and 
housing development investments with transit opportunities to increase their positive 
impact on neighborhoods.”9  It also recogni zes the need to build the city’s institutional 
capacity so that it can effectively coordinate these efforts.  To that end, the mayor created

the Housing and Community Development Cabinet, which is composed of 
representatives from city departments from hous ing and transportation to health, family 
services, and economic development.  The cabinet will be responsible for identifying 
neighborhoods for coordinated investment across sectors.  
Perhaps one of the most promising new partners in community development i s the 
health -care sector.  Factors such as educational attainment, income, access to healthy 
food, and the safety of a neighborhood tend to correlate with individual health outcomes 
in that neighborhood.  Because these factors are linked to economic health  as well as 
physical health, health -care professionals and community development organizations are 
seeing new opportunities for cooperation in low -income communities.  For example, 
public health specialists and housing leaders are working together in Seatt le to reduce the 
incidence in low -income homes of allergens that can cause or aggravate asthma.  Because 
asthma results in a significant loss of  school days and billion s of dollars in treatment 
costs, it is easy to see that these efforts have the potential  to improve not only health, but 
educational and economic outcomes as well.10  
Beyond complementary interests with community development organizations, 
health professionals offer an important set of skills and tools, including unique data sets 
and sophistic ated evaluation techniques.  For example, using data from 38 children’s 
hospitals, the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia Research Institute found an association 
between rates of foreclosures and poor health in children, including the incidence of

abuse. 11  Health -related philanthropies are also investing in projects in low -income 
communities, ranging from projects to identify the health ramifications of proposed 
community improvements to increasing access to fresh food , by creating partnerships to 
subsidi ze grocery stores in low -income communities.12   
Accelerating Transformative D evelopment  in Communities  
These examples illustrate the benefits of broad -based collaboration for 
rejuvenating communities that, in some cases, have been in decline for decades.  
Research is helping sharpen this approach and give more insight into what works.  For 
example, in 2009, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston researchers evaluated the effects of 
concentrated poverty in Springfield, Mass achusetts , as part of a larger study conduc ted by 
the Federal Reserve System.  Intrigued by the results, the Boston Fed researchers turned 
their attention to trying to identify the factors that make it possible for some cities to 
adjust to changing economic conditions while others languish.  To do this, the researchers 
identified 25 midsize  manufacturing cities around the country that were similar to 
Springfield in 1960, when that city was at the height of its prosperity, and asked what 
accounted for the differences in the economic trajectories expe rienced by this group of 
cities over the past 50 years .  Remarkably, their analysis indicated that industry mix, 
demographic makeup, and geographic location made less difference to success than the 
presence of a community leader and collaboration around a vision for the future.  In some 
cases, leadership came in the form of an energetic mayor, but not always.  In fact, the 
study found that leadership could come from almost anywhere.  The successful leader 
                                                 
11 Researchers found that each 1 percent increase in 90 -day mortgage delinquencies over a one -year period 
was associated with a 3 percent increase in hospital admissions due to child physical abuse and a 5 percent 
increase in admissions due to traumatic brain injury suspected to be caused by child abuse.   
12 See Lavizzo -Mourey, “ Health, Poverty, and Community Development ,” in note  10.   - 9 - 
was simply the person or entity that recognized the importance of preventing further 
deterioration in the local economy and agreed to take responsibility for the effort to turn 
things around.  The leader helped facilitate local collaboration, which was essential not 
only because economic development is comp licated and multidimensional, but also for 
the more prosaic reason that outside funders typically require that all interested 
stakeholders commit to a strategic direction.   
The specific avenues to recovery varied among the resurgent cities identified in 
the Boston Fed study.  Some built on traditional strengths, while others created new 
business clusters from scratch.  For example, Grand Rapids, Mich igan, was once known 
for its furniture manufacturing.  As those jobs disappeared, Grand Rapids worked to 
beco me a major medical center in the region, partnering with Michigan State University 
and Grand Valley State University to form the Medical Education and Research Center.  
Similarly, Jersey City has successfully transformed itself from a manufacturing -based 
economy to a financial center.  Its proximity to New York City makes this transformation 
seem obvious in hindsight, but other similarly situated cities have not made comparable 
strides.  
Most of the cities in the study made significant investments in infrast ructure and 
people to aid the transition to a knowledge -based economy.  For example, Greensboro, 
North Carolina , worked with the nearby cities of Winston -Salem and High Point to build 
a regional airport and to replace its manufacturing economy with one bas ed on high -tech 
research and production.  In a common pattern, Greensboro drew on local resources in 
post-secondary education, with community colleges providing courses to enhance job 
skills and universities partnering with businesses to develop innovative  products --in  - 10 - 
Greensboro’s case, in nanotechnology and pharmaceuticals.  In New Haven, Conn ecticut , 
local universities collaborate with private industry and local government to support 
biotech -related education in public schools by providing teacher traini ng, assistance in 
curriculum design, and a mobile laboratory.  
Developing Local Leaders  
These examples show that a city’s path to economic recovery typically depends 
on its ability to draw on its own particular assets.  L eaders that recognize the potential of 
those assets and foster collaboration in exploiting them can help communities remake 
themselves.   The question then becomes how to  develop and encourage local leadership.  
Technical assistance, networking opportunitie s, and mentoring programs are just some of 
the ways that leadership can be fostered locally.  
Based on its evaluation of Springfield and cities of similar size, the Boston Fed 
worked with its public, private, and philanthropic partners to come up with an id ea to 
enhance leadership and spur transformative change.  The Bank recently announced the 
Working Cities Challenge, a grant competition for smaller cities in Massachusetts that is 
designed to foster local collaboration to improve the economic health and we ll-being of 
low-income residents.  Initiatives winning grants are expected to demonstrate cross -
sector collaboration and involve groups that typically do not work together.  Prize money 
is being provided by Living Cities, a national philanthropic collabora tive; the 
Commonwealth of Massachusetts; and the Massachusetts Competitive Partnership; 
among others.  The value of the competition goes beyond grant money, though that 
undoubtedly will help those who receive it.  The real value of the competition is that it 
will encourage conversations among local stakeholders that are necessary to make real  - 11 - 
and lasting change.  Moreover, participants will receive access to technical assistance and 
planning resources, as well as to a growing network of public, private, non profit, and 
philanthropic leaders in the state who are focused on improving the economies of its 
smaller cities.  
For practitioners of community development, as in any field, joining a network of 
like-minded professionals is important for building skills a nd becoming aware of 
opportunities and resources.  NeighborWorks America, the leading provider of 
community development training in the country, has provided management and 
leadership training for community development professionals for more than 25 years.   In 
the past few years, NeighborWorks has expanded its programs to develop leadership 
among its network organizations’ executive directors and board members.  Recognizing 
that effective board leadership is key to the health and effectiveness of its more t han 
235 member organizations across the country, NeighborWorks established the Achieving 
Excellence program in 2002 for its executive directors and others in the organization with 
significant responsibility.  This 18 -month program offers professional coach ing and an 
opportunity to work with peers to solve a particular organizational challenge.   
NeighborWorks also train s community leaders through the Community Leaders 
Institute.  The institute is an annual event that attracts some 800 resident leaders from 
across the country, making it the largest residential leadership development initiative in 
the field.  Attendees arrive in teams of eig ht and choose from more than 40  workshops on 
topics such as public speaking, planning, youth development, and mobilizing senior 
citizens.  After  four days, the team s have not only learned new skills, but they have 
developed action plan s addressing particular issue s in their neighborhood s.  They are  - 12 - 
given a $2,000 grant as seed money so that they can return to their communiti es and 
immediately go to work.  More than 13,000 resident leaders have gone through the 
institute to date , and some cities have replicated the format to provide local training for 
residents.13  These and similar programs not only train leaders, but they also create 
networks, partnerships, and the opportunity to learn from each other.  
Conclusion  
In sum, community development is a complicated enterprise.  Neighborhoods and 
communities are complex organisms that will be resilient only if they are healthy along a 
number of interrelated dimensions, much as a human body cannot be healthy without 
adequate air, water, rest, and food.  But substantial coordination and dedication are 
needed to break through silos to simultaneously improve housing, connect residents to 
jobs, and help ensure access to adequate nutrition, health care, education, and day care.  
Moreover, each community has its own particular set of needs, which depend on local 
conditions and resources.  Accordingly, local leadership, together with a vision of what 
each community can be, is essential.   
With that in mind, I want to thank all of you here today for the role you play in 
bringing your skills in research and analysis to the important work of rebuilding lower -
income communities.  Community developm ent leaders have no shortage of commitment 
to their goals, but with the insights you provide, together with the opportunities to learn 
from the experiences of other communities, they will be better  prepared and thus more 
successful in meeting the very diff icult challenges they face.  Thank you for being here.

local residents.  In Seattle, training was provided in Vietnamese using translators and NeighborWorks staff.  
New Orleans, San Jose, and Charlotte have also begun to provide loc al leadership training for residents.  ",2013-04-12,bernanke

Cosponsored by the Federal Reserve System and Conference of State Bank Supervisors

September 30, 2015  
  
Thank you.  I t is truly a pleasure for me to join President Bullard and Chairman 
Cotney in welcoming you to the Community Banking Research and Policy Conference, 
which I am proud to say has been cosponsored since its inception by the Federal Reserve System and the Conf erence of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS).   
This is the third year for this conference, which I consider a milestone.  The first 
time you organize a conference like this, all you can be sure about is that there was indeed enough research and interest for su ch a conference.  The second time it is held, 
you proved that you could do it again.   
But the third year, this year, is when we can start to feel we have established a 
tradition.  If this year’s conference comes  even close to being as successful as the fi rst 
two were, and I expect it will be, I hope that we have established an ongoing role for this gathering, which provides such a great opportunity for bankers, regulators, and academic 
researchers to come together to share ideas and insights about the issu es that matter most 
in community banking.   
 Based on the agenda and conference materials I have seen, I expect participants 
over the next two days will tackle some of the most important issues facing community banks, provoke discussion and debate about opportunities and challenges, and generate some promising ideas about how community banks can continue to play the indispensable role they have played in so many communities.  The lineup of speakers, which includes my Federal Reserve Board colleague, Governo r Brainard, is impressive.  
She and others will delve deeply into the important research questions and other issues facing community banking.    - 2 - 
My role today is to welcome you on behalf of the Federal Reserve Board.  In the 
interest of getting to the impor tant work of this conference, I will be brief, but if I 
accomplish anything by speaking to you today, I hope it is to convey the Board’s 
understanding of the unique and important role of community banks in our financial system as well as  the Board’s commitment, at the highest level, to consider how our 
supervisory and regulatory decisions affect those institutions.  
My fellow Board members and I know that community banks provide essential 
financial services to households, small businesses, and farms in communities throughout the country.  We know that community banks serve many customers that large banks do not and provide services that are not offered by large banks  in many communities .  This 
circumstance is especially true in rural areas and other small com munities, where 
community banks are sometimes the only retail financial institutions.   
We understand that community bankers serve members of their local communities 
who are not just their customers, but also their neighbors and their friends.  We know the  
strong links these banks have to the people and businesses in their communities provide  
firsthand knowledge of local economic conditions.  My colleagues on the Board understand, as I do, that these close ties give community bankers special insight and  
understanding into local needs so that they can tailor their products and services to meet 
those needs. 
Although community banks largely kept to their traditional business model of 
prudent, local lending and avoided the excessive risk- tasking that helped fuel  the 
financial crisis, that crisis, and the deep recession that followed, devastated many communities and the banks that serve them.  The significant improvement in the  - 3 - 
economy since then has helped communities and community banks, but I am well aware 
that the challenges for th is sector continue, and my Board colleagues understand this also.   
We know and appreciate these concerns because the Board makes it our business 
to regularly and extensively meet with and talk to community bankers and industry leader s.  The Board of Governors meets twice a year with the Community Depository 
Institutions Advisory Council, which includes representatives of community banks, thrifts, and credit unions in each of the 12 Federal Reserve Districts.
1  The Board also has 
a Subcommittee on Smaller Regional and Community Banking, headed by Governor 
Powell and including Governor Brainard.2   
Let me also say that the experiences, aspirations , and challenges of community 
banking are not new to me.  Before I became Chair of the Boa rd of Governors and Vice 
Chair before that, I spent six years as president of the San Francisco Fed.  In this role, I was responsible for the supervision of a substantial number of community banking organizations in the nine states of the 12th D istrict.   
Among the things I learned from that experience is that , when it comes to  bank 
regulation and supervision, one size does not fit all.  T o effectively promote safety and 
soundness and ensure consumer compliance without creating undue regulatory burden, rules and supervisory approaches should be tailored to different types of institutions . 
That is why the Congress chose to exempt community banks from many aspects of new, post-crisis regulations and why financial regulators , including the Fed, have otherwise

recognized the differences between community banks and larger, more complex 
institutions.   
The Federal Reserve is committed to this approach to community bank oversight 
and to ensuring that new and existing regulations are not unduly burdensome for community banks.  One way we are fulfilling this commitment is through the regulatory 
review required by the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA).  The Federal Reserve and other agencies involved in the EGRPRA process have so far held four in a series of six planned outreach meetings at locations across the country.  We have heard many comments  about community bank concerns and are taking 
those insights into account as we consider options for alleviating unnecessary regulatory 
burden.   
Let me conclude by returning to the occasion of this conference and what I 
believe it says about the Federal Reserve’s commitment to supporting the ongoing role of 
community banking in America.   
In addition to its responsibilities for monetary policy and financial regulation and 
supervision, the Federal Reserve takes very seriously its role as a research institution.  We believe strongly in the idea that high -quality research can add to knowledge and 
understanding and help inform economic and financial policymaking to yield better decisions that benefit society.  The Fed instituted this conference in partnership with the CSBS because we believe that research can help us better understand the benefits  that 
community banks provide to society and the challenges they face.  The work presented at this conference and subsequent research that may be spurred by this work can deepen  
community bankers ’ understanding of  their businesses, and it can help state and federal  - 5 - 
regulators make better -informed decisions.  Ult imately, research can help provide 
answers to how community banks can continue to succeed in the 21st century.  
Thank you for this opportunity to speak, welcome to St. Louis, and I hope you 
enjoy the discussions of the next two days.  ",2015-09-30,yellen

“125 Years of Women at Brown Conference”  
sponsored by Brown  University  
 
Providence, Rhode Island 
       
May 5, 2017 
  
Thank you, and let me say what an honor it is, as an alumna of this great 
university, to be here today and part of this important occasion.   
As we celeb rate the 125th  anniversary of women being admitted to Brown, it 
seems appropriate to reflect on the progress that women have achieved  in the intervening 
years.  Since 1891, women have made tremendous strides in their ability to pursue their 
dreams of educa tion and meaningful work and to support themselves and their families.  
In pursuing these goals, women have helped improve working conditions for all  workers 
and have been a major factor in America’s prosperity over the past century and a quarter.   
Despit e this progress , evidence suggests that many women remain unable to 
achieve their goals.  The gap in earnings between women and men, although smaller than it was years ago, is still significant ; women continue to be underrepresented in certain 
industries and occupations ; and too many women struggle to combine aspirations for 
work and family.  Further advancement has been hampered by barriers to equal 
opportunity and workplace rules and norms that  fail to support a reasonable work -life 
balance.  If these obstacles persist, we will squander the potential of many of our citizens 
and incur a substantial loss to the productive capacity of our economy at a time when the 
aging of the population and weak productivity growth are already weighing on economic growth.   
To enliven the history I will present today, I will include the experiences of 
women graduates of this institution, in most cases in their own words, as related in oral histories preserved by B rown.
1  Among these alumnae, I am proud to say, is a member of 
my own family who was an early graduate of Pembroke, Elizabeth Stafford Hirschfelder 
                                                 
1 I am grateful for th e assistance of Brown University staff in facilitating access to  Brown Women Speak, 
the University’s oral history project, and particularly the help of archivist Mary Murphy.   - 2 - 
of the Class of 1923.  Her career and achievements as a mathematician embody both the 
opportunities that ope ned for Pembroke graduates in the decades after she left here and 
the limitations many women faced and the compromises she, like so many others, was forced to make.  
A Historical P erspective on Women in the L abor F orce 
From the time that Brown began to acc ept women and into the 1920s, most 
women in the United States did not work outside the home , and those who did were 
primarily young and unmarried.  In that era, just 20 percent of all women were “gainful 
workers,” as the Census Bureau then categorized labo r force participation outside the 
home, and only 5 percent of those married were categorized as such.
2  Of course, these 
statistics somewhat understate the contributions of married women to the economy 
beyond housekeeping and childrearing, since women’s work in the home often included work in family businesses and the home production of goods, such as agricultural 
products, for sale.  Also, the aggregate statistics obscure the differential experience of 
women by race.  African American women were about twic e as likely to participate in the 
labor force as were white women at the time, largely because they were more likely to remain in the labor force after marriage.
3   
                                                 
2 My discussion of the history of female labor force participation draws heavily on the pioneering work of 
Claudia Goldin, including her 2006 Ely Lecture “The Quiet Revolution that Transformed Women’s 
Employment, Education, and Family” to the American Economic Association and her 1990 work 
Understanding the Gender Gap:  An Economic History of American Women , from which the statistics on 
female labo r force participation from the late 19 th century until the mid -20th century are drawn.  A 
thorough discussion of the quality of these data and their usefulness in making comparisons over time is 
included in that work.  
3 The higher participation rates of African American women have been attributed to different cultural 
norms that developed during slavery and the legacy of slavery, which left blacks impoverished and with low levels of education, making women’s wages an im portant source of family income ( Boustan  and 
Collins , 2013; Goldin, 1977) .  - 3 - 
What was true for women in general was also true of the early graduates of what 
was then ca lled the Women’s College, the large majority of whom got married, raised 
families, and did not pursue careers.  The fact that many women left work upon marriage 
reflected cultural norms, the nature of the work available to them, and legal strictures.  The occupational choices of those young women who did work were severely circumscribed.  Most women lacked significant education --only 54 percent of girls aged 
5 to 19 w ere enrolled in school in 1890.
4  And women with little education mostly toiled 
as piece wo rkers in factories or as domestic workers, jobs that were dirty and often 
unsafe.  Educated women, like those who attended Brown’s Women’s College, were scarce.  Fewer than 2 percent of all 18 - to 24- year-olds were enrolled in an institution of 
higher educ ation, and just one -third of those were women.
5  Such women did not have to 
perform manual labor, but their choices were likewise constrained.  Edna McDonald was 
a graduate of the Class of 1919, and in her oral history, she summed up the opportunities 
for her and her classmates:  “Let’s be frank,” she said. “What choices did women have?  
Teaching.  You could teach.  You could be a lab technician.  Or you could go into office 
work and be a secretary.  Those were the only real choices.”  Margery Chittenden 
Leonard graduated from Pembroke in 1929 and went on to earn a J.D. as the only woman 
in her class at Boston University --after two others withdrew.  And with that law degree, 
her first job was as a secretary, and she continued to struggle to find work as a lawyer.  In 
her oral history, Doris Madeline Hopkins, a 1928 graduate, talked about the opportunity

that she had to work, but also about being told she had to leave her job once she got 
married.  Indeed, at the time, marriage bars were widespread.6   
There were notable exceptions, such as, of course , Mary Emma Woolley, a Brown 
graduate who went on to serve as the president of Mount Holyoke College, and Ethel Robinson, the first black woman to graduate from Brown, who taught English at Howard University.  Helen Butts, from the Class of 1928, taught natural sciences at Smith and later zoology at Wellesley, the beginning of a long and productive career as a biological researcher.  Another exception wa s Betty Stafford, the aunt of my husband, George.  She 
grew up in Providence, earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees at Brown in mathematics and then rather adventurously headed west,  teaching at two universities in Texas in the 
1920s before completing her  Ph.D. and then teaching at the University of Wisconsin.   
Despite the widespread sentiment against women, particularly married women, 
working outside the home and with the limited opportunities available to them, women 
did enter the labor force in greater numbers over this period, with participation rates reaching nearly 50 percent for single women by 1930 and nearly 12 percent for married women.  This rise suggests that while the incentive, and in many cases the imperative, remained for women to drop out of the labor market at marriage when they could rely on their husband’s income, mores were changing.  Indeed, these years overlapped with the so-called first wave of the women’s movement, when women came together to agitate for 
change on a variety of socia l issues, including suffrage and temperance, and which 
culminated in the ratification of the 19 th amendment in 1920 guaranteeing women the 
right to vote.   
                                                 
6 Goldin  (1990 ), pp. 160 -66.  - 5 - 
Between the 1930s and mid- 1970s, women’s participation in the economy 
continued to rise, with the ga ins primarily owing to an increase in work among married 
women.  By 1970, 50 percent of single women and 40 percent of married women were 
participating in the labor force.7  Several factors contributed to this rise.  First, with the 
advent of mass high sch ool education, graduation rates rose substantially.8  At the same 
time, new technologies contributed to an increased demand for clerical workers, and 
these jobs were increasingly taken on by women.  Moreover, because these jobs tended to 
be cleaner and saf er, the stigma attached to work for a married woman diminished.  And 
while there were still marriage bars that forced women out of the labor force, these 
formal barriers were gradually removed over the period following World War II.  Another innovation was  the introduction in the late 1940s of part -time schedules, which 
combined with the proliferation of modern appliances to make it more feasible for married women to work outside the home.
9   
Over the decades from 1930 to 1970, increasing opportunities also arose for 
highly educated women, such as the graduates of what was by then called Pembroke College, to work in professions.  That said, early in that period, most women still expected to have short careers, and women were still largely viewed as secondary  earners 
whose husbands’ careers came first.  Thus, while it was becoming more common for women such as Betty Stafford to teach at colleges and universities, their career prospects were not the same as those for men.  After earning her Ph.D . at Wisconsin , Betty married 
a fellow student and over the next decade coauthored five important papers with him and 
                                                 
7 Note that for the 1970s and beyond, the participation rate is calculated as a share of those age d 16 and 
older, whereas for earlier years it is calculated as a share of those age d 15 and older.

a well -regarded reference work.  But, while her husband progressed from instructor to 
professor at Wisconsin, Betty worked as an instructor on an ad hoc basis.  During World 
War II, while he worked for the government in Washington and New York, Betty stayed 
in Madison, teaching math to servicemen.  When he took a job teaching in California after the war, they divorced, and it was only then that she was a gi ven a position as 
assistant professor.  
As time progressed, attitudes about women working and their employment 
prospects did change.  As women gained experience in the labor force, they increasingly saw that they could balance work and family.  A new model of the two- income family 
emerged.
10  Some women began to attend college and graduate school with the 
expectation of working, whether or not they planned to marry and have families, as did Rita Schorr -Germain, an immigrant who survived Auschwitz, graduated f rom Pembroke 
in 1953, and went on to teach European history while her husband also had a successful 
academic career.  In her oral history, Rita says she was encouraged by many Brown 
professors and never considered the possibility that her gender would stand in the way of an academic career, a shift in outlook that was becoming increasingly common in the 1950s.  As did most women’s colleges at the time, Pembroke continued to produce nurses, schoolteachers, and social workers, and many women who worked only until they 
married and had children.  But, from the late 1950s on, it also increasingly graduated writers, doctors, lawyers, diplomats, physicians, psychotherapists, and archeologists, and, 
                                                 
10 For instance, although many women who had joined the war effort in the 1940s were fired at the end of 
the war, as the Korean War effort picked up and the demand for the labor of women rose, women, who had 
learned that they could combine work and family wer e ready to reenter the labor force, so that by the early 
1950s female labor force participation resumed its war -time high  (Kessler -Harris , 1982, pp. 302 -03).  
Moreover, evidence suggests that sons whose mothers increased their labor force participation in the wake 
of World War II had wives who were more likely to work (Fernández, Fogli, and Olivette, 2004).   - 7 - 
in 1959, the first female faculty member of Brown University.  Amon g those women 
fortunate to attend Pembroke in this era of dramatic change was me.  I enrolled at Brown 
fully planning to attend graduate school and have a career, as did many of my classmates in the Class of 1967.   
By the 1970s, a dramatic change in women’s work lives was under  way.  In the 
period after World  War II, many women had not expected that they would spend as much 
of their adult lives working as turned out to be the case.  By  contrast , in the 1970s young 
women more commonly expected that they would spend a substantial portion of their lives in the labor force, and they prepared for it, increasing their educational attainment and taking courses and college majors that better equipped them f or careers as opposed to 
just jobs.   
In surveys of young people about their expectations of their futures, young 
women during this era increasingly placed an emphasis on career success.
11  Susan 
Graber Slusky of the Class of 1971 said in her oral history t hat she chose Pembroke for 
Brown’s excellence in chemistry and physics, because she was already planning the career she went on to have as a researcher.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, this is also the period 
in which many all -male colleges admitted women or comb ined their women’s and men’s 
undergraduate schools, as Brown did when it merged Pembroke and Brown College 
in 1971. 
These changes in attitudes and expectations were supported by other changes 
under  way in society.  Workplace protections were enhanced through the passage of the 
Pregnancy Discrimination Act in 1978 and the recognition of sexual harassment in the 
                                                 
11 Interestingly, over this time young men put increasing weight on family.  Goldin (2006 ), pp. 9 and 11.   - 8 - 
workplace.  Access to birth control increased, which allowed married couples greater 
control over the size of their families and young women the abil ity to delay marriage and 
to plan children around their educational and work choices.12  And in 1974, women 
gained, for the first time, the right to apply for credit in their own name without a male 
co-signe r.13 
By the early 1990s, the labor force participat ion rate of prime working- age 
women --those between the ages of 25 and 54--reached just over 74 percent, compared 
with roughly 93 percent for prime working- age men.   By then, the share of women going 
into the traditional fields of teaching, nursing, social work, and clerical work declined, 
and more women were becoming doctors, lawyers, managers, and, yes, professors.  As women increased their education and joined industries and occupations formerly dominated by men, the gap in earnings between women and men began to close significantly.
14  
Positive Spillovers from Women’s Increased Participation in the Workforce  
Looking back, the story of the past 125 years is one of slow but steady progress 
toward women’s full participation in the economy and the fulfillment of their career goals.  Unfortunately, the success of women has often been seen as coming at the expense of men.  Indeed, regularly in the late 19th  and 20th  centuries there were calls to 
protect men from women’s entry into the labor force.  The early fema le graduates of 
Brown faced such attitudes from fellow students and even from faculty.  Ruth Pederson, a 
                                                 
12 See, for example, Bailey  (2010) and Goldin an d Katz (2002).  
13 The Equal Credit Opportunity Act, passed in 1974, prohibited discrimination in the provision of credit on 
the basis of gender, race, religion, marital status and national origin.  It also disallowed credit providers 
from asking women about  their plans for future children.  
14 Blau and Kahn  (2016) .  - 9 - 
member of the Class of 1919, said some professors did not  want to teach women and 
prohibited women from taking their classes.  Margery Leonard remember ed one Boston 
University professor who urged her to drop out of law school.  When she refused, this 
professor punished her by forcing her to recite the details of rape and seduction cases before her jeering, stomping classmates.  And it wasn’t  only men who had this attitude.  
Among the women who were fighting for better labor standards early in the 20th  century, 
many were heavily influenced by elite cultural standards that viewed a woman’s place as in the home and argued that men should be paid a “family wa ge” that would allow them 
to support their family singlehandedly--a standard that many working- class families 
could not afford.  Moreover, many of the labor protections promoted to protect women were often based on theories about women’s weaker nature, and these protections served to circumscribe their work.
15  During the Great Depression, limiting women’s role in the 
workforce was considered a way to address the high rates of unemployment, although the 
experience of those years showed the importance of women in supporting their families 
financially.16  Similarly, women who had successfully worked during World War II, 
either as part of the war effort or to support their families while their husbands were fighting, often were pushed out of their jobs to make room for returning soldiers.
17  
After the war and then single, my relative, Betty Stafford, remained an assistant 
professor at the University of Wisconsin despite an enviable body of research.  She 
married another Wisconsin professor, an eminent chemist, and collaborated with him on his research.  But, in 1954, she gave up her assistant professorship, she said, to be able to

accompany her husband on his frequent international travels.  Betty later moved with her 
husband to California, and after his death, she endowed a graduate fellowship in the sciences and a prize in theoretical chemistry.  Although Betty’s accomplishments were considerable, against the backdrop of increasing opportunity for women over her lifetime  
I believe that Betty Stafford Hirschfeld er was denied opportunities and greater success 
simply because she was a woman.   
Despite the fears of some that women entering into the workforce would crowd 
out men, the evidence shows that the rise in women’s participation has contributed to widespread improvements in the safety and productivity of our workplaces, to the health 
of families, and to the macroeconomic success that our country has enjoyed over the past 125 years.   
In the first decades of the 20 th century, the struggle to improve the working 
conditions of young women drawn into factories was a pillar of the overall movement 
toward improved labor standards.  Women’s demands for safer factories, humane workweeks, and higher pay, which were often pursued through organizing and striking, contributed substantially to the social upheaval and public debate of that period that eventually led to the passage of stronger labor standards.  These efforts also produced generations of women who went on to be leaders in the broader labor movement and in the broader movements for equality.  
The rise in female labor force participation was an early focus of and helped 
establish the fields of statistics and labor economics in their modern incarnations.  Carroll Wright, the first commissioner of what is now known a s the Bureau of Labor Statistics  
and who established the high standards for data collection and analysis for which the  - 11 - 
bureau is known, devoted his agency’s fourth annual report, for the year  1888, to the 
topic of Working Women in Large Cities.18  Moreover, the issues surrounding women’s 
work, such as the minimum wage, pay equity, and maximum workweeks, were topics of 
great interest to early practitioners of labor economics.19 
It is often said that we should welcome women’s presence in the workplace 
because i t allows us to capitalize on the talents of our entire population, and this is 
certainly true.  But it is also good business.  A number of studies on how groups perform indicate that workforces that vary on dimensions such as gender, race, and ethnicity 
produce better decisionmaking processes and better outcomes.
20 
Evidence also suggests that women’s work has positive spillovers to their family 
lives and to the success of their children, which in turn benefits all of society.  It is a well-
established findin g in the literature on development that maternal education and work are 
positively associated with better health and educational outcomes for children.21  A 
recent meta -study also suggests that children in the United States with working mothers 
do as well i f not better in school, both academically and behaviorally, than children with 
mothers that stay home full time.  This effect is particularly strong for families that have 
fewer social and economic resources,  including single -parent families.22  As time goe s 
on, girls with working mothers are more likely to be employed and hold supervisory 
positions, and they earn somewhat more.  In addition, sons raised in families with

working mothers assume greater childcare responsibilities as adults than sons whose 
moth ers did not work.23  
This is not to say that children do not  need attention from both parents to develop 
into academically successful and socially well -adjusted adults --they certainly do.  Also, 
as I will discuss, women are making choices that reflect their  desire to balance work and 
family.  These findings bear on the question of  how best to support women’s work 
through public policies aimed at helping women and men better manage work and family.   
From a macroeconomic perspective, women’s incorporation int o the economy 
contributed importantly to the rapid rise in economic output and well -being over the 
20th century.  Between 1948 and 1990, the rise in female participation contributed about 
1/2 percentage point per year to the potential growth rate of real gross domestic product.
24  And this estimate does not take into account the effect of the increases in 
women’s education and work experience that also occurred over that period and boosted 
their productivity.  In addition, since 1979, women have accounted f or a majority of the 
rise in real household income.  In dollar terms , the gains were greatest for households in 
the top third of the earnings distribution, but without the increase in women’s earnings, 
families in the bottom and middle thirds of the distribution would have experienced declines.
25  
Remaining Challenges and Some Possible Solutions  
I have argued thus far that we, as a country, have reaped great benefits from the 
increasing role that women have played in the economy.  But evidence suggests that

barriers to women’s continued progress remain.  The participation rate for prime 
working- age women  peaked in the late 1990s and currently stands at about 75 percent.26  
Of course, women, particularly those with lower levels of education, have been affected by the same economic forces that have been pushing down participation among men, 
including technical change and globalization.
 27  However, women’s participation 
plateaued at a level well  below that of prime  working- age men , which stands at over 
88 percent.   While some married women choose not to work, the size of this disparity 
should lead us to examine the extent to which structural problems, such as a lack of equal 
opportunity and challenges to combining work and family, are holding back women’s advancement. 
As I mentioned earlier, the gap in earnings between men and women has 
narrowed substantially, but progress has slowed lately, and women working full time still earn about 17 percent less than men , on average , each week.
28  Even when we compare 
men and w omen in the same or similar occupations who appear nearly identical in 
background and experience, a gap of about 10 percent typically remains.29  As such, we 
cannot rule out that gender -related impediments  hold back women, including outright 
                                                 
26 The labor force participation rate for all women declined from a peak of 60 percent in 1999 and 2000 and 
now stands a bit below 57 percent.  However, as has been documented elsewhere, much of the decline for 
all women can be explained by the aging of the baby boomers into their retirement years  and lower 
participation  among teens and young adults.  It is also possible that the labor force participation rate is still 
being held down a bit by the waning effects of the Great Recession.  Aaronson and others (2014).  
27 Aaronson and others (2014).  Also see Council of Economi c Advisers  (2016) and the studies cited 
therein . 
28 Blau  and Kahn  (2016).  
29 Manning and Swaffield (2008) find that although men and women enter the British labor force earning 
the same amount, among those who worked continuously and full time for 10 years, women would still 
earn 8 percent less than men, even if they have the same personality traits, were childless, and profess no 
interest in having children.  Also see Blau and Kahn  (2016 ) and Noonan, Corcoran,  and Courant  (2005).   - 14 - 
discrimination, attitudes that reduce women’s success in the workplace, and an absence 
of mentors. 
Recent research has shown that although women now enter professional schools 
in numbers nearly equal to men, they are still substantially less likely to reach the highest echelons of their professions.
30  For instance, 47 percent of students at top- 50 law schools 
are female, and women obtain 40 percent of M .B.A.’s from top programs.  Nonetheless, 
women are still poorly represented among corporate CEOs, as partners in top law firms, and as executives in finance.
31  Even in my own field of economics , women constitute 
only about one -third of Ph .D. recipients, a number that has barely budged in two 
decades.32  This lack of success in climbing the professional ladder would seem to 
explain why the wage gap actually remains largest for those at the top of the earnings distribution.
33   
One of the primary factors contributing to the failure of these highly skilled 
women to reach the tops of their professions and earn equal pay is that top jobs in fields such as law and business require longer workweeks and penalize taking time off .  This  
would have a disproportionately large ef fect on women, who continue to bear the lion’s 
share of domestic and child -rearing responsibilities.
34  Within academia, the short 
timeframe  in which assistant professors have to prove themselves good candidates for

tenure by publishing typically overlaps w ith the period in which many women 
contemplate starting a family, forcing difficult trade -offs.35   
Employers may require the long hours and short absences for good reasons --for 
instance, the work may involve relationships with clients or accumulating a significant 
amount of knowledge about a deal or case in a condensed period of time.  If it is costly for employees to share information and split the work, then there would be a high premium, in the form of compensation, for those who can work the long hours.
36  
Workplaces where the income of employees depends on the effort of co -workers, such as 
law partnerships, also have an incentive to require long workweeks.37   
But h owever sensible such  arrangement s may be from a business perspective, it 
can be difficult for women to meet the demands in these fields once they have children.  The very fact that t hese types of  jobs require such long hours likely discourages some 
women --as well as men --from pursuing these caree r tracks.  Advances in technology 
have facilitated greater work -sharing and flexibility in scheduling, and there are further 
opportunities in this direction.
38  Economic models also suggest that while it can be 
difficult for any one employer to move to a model with shorter hours, if many firms were to change their model, they and their workers could all be better off.
39 
Of course, most women are not employed in fields that require such long hours or 
that impose such severe penalties for taking time off.  But the difficulty of balancing work and family is a widespread problem.  In fact, the recent trend in many occupations 
                                                 
35 Unfortunately, in contrast to some of the successful gender neutral policies I discuss below, efforts to 
address the tenure problem by giving  all new parents extra time before the tenure decision has actu ally had 
the effect of reducing female tenure rates and raising those of men. Antecol, Bedrard and Stearns, (2016).  
36 Goldin (2014).  
37 See, for example , Akerlof (1976) and Landers, Rebitzer , and Taylor  (1996).

is to demand complete scheduling flexibility, which can result in too few hours of work 
for those with family demands and can make it diffic ult to schedule childcare.40  Reforms 
that encourage companies to provide some predictability in schedules, cross -train 
workers to perform different tasks , or require a minimum guaranteed number of hours in 
exchange for flexibility could improve the lives of workers holding such jobs.  Another problem is that in most states, childcare is affordable for fewer than half of all families.
41  
And just 5 percent of workers with wages in the bottom quarter of the wage distribution have jobs that provide them with pa id family leave.
42  This circumstance puts many 
women in the position of having to choose between caring for a sick family member and keeping their jobs.   
In this context, it is useful to compare the workforce experiences of American 
women to those in othe r advanced economies.  In 1990, the labor force participation rate 
in the United States of prime working -age women, 74 percent, was higher than in all but 
a few industrialized nations.  But in the intervening years, while the participation rate of U.S. wom en was roughly stable, elsewhere it increased steadily, and by 2010 the United 
States fell to 17 th place out of 22 advanced economies with respect to female labor force 
participation.
43  A number of studies have examined the role of various public policies in 
explaining patterns in female labor force participation across countries.  These studies find that policy differences --in particular, the expansion of paid leave following 
childbirth , steps to improve the availability and affordability of childcare, and increased 
availability of part -time work --go a long way toward explaining the divergence between 
                                                 
40 Cajner  and others  (2014);  Lambert , Haley -Lock , and Henly (2012).

advanced economies.44  Evidence suggests that if the United States had policies in place 
such as those employed in many European countries, female labor force participation 
could be as high as 82 percent.45  
However, these policies entail tradeoffs .  Women in other advanced economies 
are more likely than women in the United States to be employed part  time, which could 
reflect a greater ease in arranging flexible schedules and more time with family, but it 
also comes with costs, including a wage penalty and fewer opportunities for training and 
advancement.  Such findings raise the question of whether the policies enacted overseas in recent years have had the uninte nded consequence of making it more expensive for 
employers there to hire women into full- time jobs with opportunities for advancement, as 
women  are more likely to be eligible for and to make use of such benefits.
46 
This possibility should inform our own thi nking about policies to make it easier 
for women and men to combine their family and career aspirations.  For instance, 
improving access to affordable and good quality childcare  would appear to fit the bill, as 
it has been shown to support full -time employ ment.47  Recently , there also seems to be 
some momentum for providing families with paid leave at the time of childbirth.  The 
experience in Europe suggests picking policies that do not  narrowly target childbirth, but 
instead can be used to meet a variety o f the health and caregiving responsibilities.48  
                                                 
44 Note that Blau and Kahn  (2013) do not find that improvement  in the provision of childcare  in other 
advanced economies relative to the United States explain the divergence in participation since the 1990s; 
however, Thévenon (2013) finds that the greater provision of childcare  has a positive effect on full -time 
employment.  
45 Blau and Kahn (2013), p. 7.  
46 In most European countries, men are significantly less likely than women to use paid parental leave, 
although in a few countries, including Sweden and Iceland, over 40 percent of users of parental leave are 
men (OECD, 2016).

Conclusion 
The United States faces a number of longer -term economic challenges, including 
the aging of the population and the low growth rate of productivity.  One recent study 
estimates that increasing the f emale participation rate to that of men would raise our gross 
domestic product by 5 percent.49  And, as I have argued, our workplaces and families, as 
well as women themselves, would benefit from continued progress.  However, a number of factors, which I ha ve only had a chance to touch upon, appear to be holding women 
back, including the difficulty women currently have in trying to combine their careers with other aspects of their lives , including caregiving.  In looking to solutions, we should 
consider impr ovements to work environments and policies that benefit not only women, 
but all workers.  Pursuing such a strategy would be in keeping with the story of the rise in women’s involvement in the workforce, which, as I have described here, has contributed not only to their own well -being but more broadly to the welfare and prosperity of our 
country.   
The title for my remarks today, “So We All Can Succeed,” was inspired by 
Malala Yousafzai, the advocate for girls’ and women’s education, who said, “ We cannot 
all succeed when half of us are held back.”

by admitting women 125 years ago, by educating many thousands of women over the

 It is a pleasure to be with you today to discuss  the evolving money and payments 
landscape  in the United States , which is  a topic of primary importance to the Federal Reserve .  
Technolog ical innovation has changed this landscape in recent years, as we have seen the 
emergence of new financial services entrants  offering payments services, new pla tforms 
designed to increase the speed of payments, clearing, and settlement, and new forms of digital 
money .  Over the past several years, and as a direct result of these developments , we have  seen a 
significant increase in attention on central bank digital currencies (CBDC s) from central banks 
around the world in addition to a great deal of international and domestic engagement on CBDC.   
A number of c entral banks have taken steps to begin exploring the potential uses of a CBDC in 
their home countries.  A very small number  have adopted a CBDC for their local jurisdictions.   
And of course, discussions of the purpose , design , and potential risks  of a U.S.  CBDC, and 
technical research about key design elements, continue here in the United States.   While the 
Federal Reserve plays an important role in these ongoing discussions and technical research, the 
Fed would not implement a U.S. CBDC without the approva l of Congress.   
In broad terms, a CBDC is simply a new form of digital liability of a central bank.  
Because it is issued by a central bank, CBDC is typically thought of as being denominated in the 
currency of that central bank .  One could imagine a digita l U.S. dollar, a digital euro, or a digital 
pound.   Beyond this baseline definition though, “what is a CBDC” defies a simple definition.  A 
CBDC built on distributed ledger technology offers a wide range of design and potential use 
options , as well as pote ntial risks .  This variability complicates any discussion of a CBDC simply 
because we may not be talking about the same thing.  
There are two threshold questions  that a policymaker needs to ask before any decision to 
move forward with a CBDC .  First, what problem is the policymaker trying to solve, and is a - 2 - 
 
 CBDC a potential solution ?  Second, what features and considerations —including unintended 
consequences —may a policymaker want to consider in deciding to  design  and adopt  a CBDC?  
While it would be impossible for me to provide a comprehensive analysis of every issue 
surrounding CBDC , my goal today is to offer a perspective on these two threshold questions and 
to conclude with some thoughts about the impera tive for future research on CBDCs and the 
potential future of CBDC s in the United States.  
What Problem Could a CBDC Solve?  
In my view, the fundamental question is: what problem could  a CBDC solve?  
CBDC and the Payment System  
One issue being examined is wh ether a CBDC or even broader forms of digital money 
could make the payment system more efficient .  Do these new technologies present opportunities 
to increase the speed of payments and/or lower costs and frictions within the payment system ?   
Of course, this question takes place in the context of the payments infra structure in each 
jurisdi ction , both for domestic payments and for cross -border payments .  Many countries have 
launched faster payment systems and continue to investigate how central banks can support these 
payment systems.  We have seen a wide range of motivations for this work, including addressing 
specific inefficiencies in the payment system, providing a CBDC if cash use were to decline, or 
promoting broader private -sector innovati on for future generations of payments .1   
 
1  For example, The Bank of England and HM Treasury have stated that they judge that it is likely a digital pound 
will be needed in the future and that further preparatory work is justified.  See Bank of England and HM Treasury, 
The Digital Pound: A New Form of Money for Households and Businesses?  Consultation Paper (London: Bank of 
England, February 2023), https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/ -/media/boe/files/paper/2023/the -digital -pound -
consultation -working -paper.pdf?la=en&hash=5CC053D3820DCE2F40656E772D9105FA10C654EC . 
However, the UK parliament has previously expressed skepticism.  See House of Lords, UK Parli ament, Central 
Bank Digital Currencies: A Solution in Search of a Problem? , HL Paper 131, (London: House of Lords, UK 
Parliament, January 2022), https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/175/economic -affairs -
committee/news/160221/central -bank -digital -currencies -a-solution -in-search -of-a-problem -report -published/ .  
Similarly , a government -appointed report in Sweden did not find a current need for a CBDC, though the Riksbank 
 - 3 - 
 
 Improving the speed of payments, particularly retail payments, can be accomplished  
without the introduction of a CBDC.  In the United States , beginning  later this year, the Federal 
Reserve’s FedNowSM Service  will enable  banks in the United States to offer their customers the 
ability to send and receive payments  in real -time.2   
Policymakers have also raised other arguments for why a CBDC may be suitable in their 
home countries.  Some have argued that a CBDC would facilitate large -value transactions  
between financial institutions .3  Others see CBDC as a vehicle to improve upon international 
payments.   And still o thers view CBDC s as necessary to preserve the role of central bank money 
as a stabilizing force in the payments system and to safeguard monetary sovereignty ,4 or to 
ensure that digital money has a high degree of safety and uniformity to promote innovation and 
competition.5 
CBDC and Financial Inclusion   
Another issue  that some have raised is whether innovation in money and payments, 
including a potential U.S. CBDC, could improve financial inclusion.  We can all agree that 
 
continues to investigate how an e -krona could work if a decision is taken in the future to issue digital central bank 
money. See Centralbanking.com, “Swed en Does Not Yet Need CBDC, Inquiry Finds,” web article,

Reserve Announces July Launch for the FedNow Service,” news release, March 15, 2023,

3  Agustín Carstens , general manager  of the Bank for International Settlements has discuss ed the idea of a “unified 
ledger” run by the central bank to fully realize the potential of new technologies developed by the private sector.

 financial inclusion is an important goal when considering improvements in access to financial 
services , banking, and the payment system.  However, in the U nited States today, over 95  
percent  of households have a least one member of the household with a banking relationship 
holding a checking or savings account.6  Of the remaining 4.5 percent  who are not banked, 
nearly three -quarters have no interest in having a bank account, and approximately  one-third 
cited a lack of  trust in banks as the reason for not having a bank account .  I think it is unlikely 
that this group would find the government somehow more trustworthy  than highly regulated 
banks .  Unbanked households are also less likely to own mobile phones  or have access to the 
internet, which would present barriers to CBDC adoption.  While there has been important 
research  on these barriers to adoption, including consumer attitudes and technology 
requirements,  policymakers also need to consider whether there are other means to improve 
financial inclusion , such as  alternatives for  making the distribution of government benefi ts more 
efficient and effective  like promoting financial literacy .7 
CBDC for Implementation of Policy Objectives  
Another  issue is whether the government should  use new technologies, including a 
potential CBDC, to accomplish a variety of policy objectives beyond those directly related to the 
operating of an efficient and safe financial system .  Imagine a scenario in which  fiscal spending, 
in the form of government benefits or payments , could be transferred via CBDC and could 
include a limited timeframe in which they could be spent before expiring.   Enabling  this type of

 limit through a CBDC would stand in stark contrast to the flexibility and freedom embedded in  
physical currency or bank deposits and could serve to control or even harm consumer s and 
businesses.  There is also a risk that this type of control could lead to the politi cization of the 
payments system and at its heart, how money is used .  A CBDC that permitted t his type of 
control not only has the potential to allow the government to  limit certain types of private 
spending or limit access to banking accounts, it could also threaten the Federal Reserve’s 
independence . 
The Efficiency and Speed  of the Payments System  
CBDCs are often discussed in the context of provid ing fast or instant p ayments for a 
variety of transactions, whether consumer -to-business or person -to-person transactions.  As I 
previously noted , the introduction of the FedNow  Service in the U nited States and other instant 
payments platforms global ly leads me to ask: What could a CBDC accomplish, if anything, over 
and above what instant payments platforms alone can accomplish?   There are potential use cases 
in the context of certain interbank transactions in wholesale markets , where s ome transactions 
are slow and heavily resource -intensive to clear and settle.  Participants in the wholesale 
financial markets have been considering innovative ways to address these frictions with newer 
technologies such as distributed ledger technology in which shared inf ormation across 
counterparties could be leveraged to increase speed and reduce back -office costs to reconcile 
transactions before they settle.  In the public debate about CBDC, some have argued that the 
introduction of a wholesale version  of a CBDC could f ully unlock the benefits of these newer 
technologies for these financial market use cases.  Similar to the questions noted for a retail level 
CBDC, policymakers must carefully consider the wholesale use cases, including whether there is - 6 - 
 
 added value of a wh olesale version of CBDC in supporting new infrastructure to financial 
transactions over and above existing methods.  
Cross -Border Activities  
In the international context, frictions and high costs are pain points often associated with 
cross -border payments.   Many policymakers have discussed whether CBDCs could play a role in 
streamlining cross -border payments by using new technologies, introducing simplified 
distribution channels, and creating additional opportunities for cross -jurisdictional collaboration 
and interoperability .  Of course, these opportunities may be limited by the regulatory and legal 
safeguards in place for payments between countries with different legal structures, including 
customer identification, customer due diligence, and sanctions scr eening for compliance with 
regulations and policies for Bank Secrecy Act/Anti -Money Laundering (BSA/AML) .  These 
competing priorities are challenging to reconcile .  While cross -border payments are among the 
slowest and least efficient, they also raise subs tantial legal and regulatory compliance concerns 
that would apply equally to CBDCs.  
International Role of the U.S. Dollar  
Another consideration is whether a CBDC  (or lack of it)  would affect the role of the U.S. 
dollar in international trade.8  In my view, the dollar  serves this role because of the size of the 
U.S. economy, its deep and liquid financial markets, the strength of U.S. institutions, and its 
commitment to the rule of law.  A CBDC, or lack of it, may not meaningfully change the 
existing incentive s for people, firms , or countries to conduct business in the d ollar.  Therefore , 
 
8  See Christopher J. Waller, “The U.S. Dollar and Central Bank Digital Currencies,” speech at Digital Currencies 
and National Security Tradeoffs, a symposium presented by the Harvard National Security Journal, Cambridge, 
Massach usetts , October 14, 2022 , https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20221014a.htm . (“I 
don’t think there are implications …[on the adoption of a U.S. CBDC] fo r the role of the United States in the global 
economy and financial system .”) - 7 - 
 
 maintenance of the dollar as a reserve global currency will require broad policies that  foster 
economic growth, liquid markets , and an unwavering commitment to the rule of law.  And we 
should have an imperative to research and  experiment with  new technological innovation.  I will 
say more on that shortly.  
Declining Cash Use  and CBDC  
In jurisdictions that have not adopted a CBDC, c ash is generally the only central bank 
money available to the public, and it  remains an important and popular means of payment.9  In 
some countries , however, digital payments have rapidly supplanted the use of cash.  As a result  
of this trend, many central banks have cited the importance of access to central bank money by 
the general public  as a potential reason to issue a CBDC.  For example, Sir Jon C unliffe of the 
United Ki ngdom  examined the central role money plays in social and economic stability  and 
concluded that , because private money ha s been replacing the use of government money  over 
time, at some point “a retail, general purpose digital currency …will be needed in  the U.K.”10  
Because the Federal Reserve  is committed to ensuring the continued safety and availability of 
cash, a CBDC  could be considered as a means to expand safe payment options, not to reduce or 
replace them.  So, an important issue for us to consider would be whether  a CBDC could provide 
the public with a more attractive alternative to cash in a world that may be shifting away from 
cash-based payments.   In probing this question, we need to also consider the privacy 
implications, and whether a CBDC would be a better alternative than private -sector solutions.

 Stablecoins and CBDC  
Some new private forms of  money, often referred to as stablecoins, have emerged mainly 
to support trading in the crypto -asset ecosystem  both as a means of payment and as a store of 
value .  These stablecoins, which purport to have convertibility one -for-one with the dollar, have 
also been discussed as an alternative  to traditional payments.  However, s tablecoins  are less 
secure, less stable , and less regulated than traditional forms of money . and their structure s and 
framework s are opaque .  To the extent stablecoins become widely used in day-to-day payments, 
these features could raise significant concerns .  Of course , issuing a CBDC has been discussed as 
a potential  alternative to stablecoins that could address some of these shortcomings.  It is also 
possible that Congress c ould pass legislation to strengthen the regulation and oversight of 
stablecoins  to mitigate some of the se issues .  I will be following developments in Congress 
closely on this and other digital assets .  Regardless, it is important for us to continue to eva luate 
the evolving landscape of digital assets and understand whether and how well-regulated 
stablecoins or a CBDC would interact with each other and with the broader payments system.   
Design Features and Policy Considerations  
The Fed’s ongoing exploratory work helps us to think critically about a future shaped by 
innovations in payments and the broader economy, including instant payments and new potential 
forms of money and payment systems like CBDCs and other digital assets that c ould potentially 
play a larger  role in the economy.  While the investigation of CBDC raises many policy 
questions , for the purposes of today’s discussion I will focus on a few key areas that are 
important from my perspective . - 9 - 
 
 Privacy Considerations  
As we consider these potential opportunities for improvements and innovation, we must 
also note that the introduction of a CBDC could present significant risks, challenges, and 
tradeoffs.  First, in my view safeguarding privacy is a top conc ern and is also often identified as a 
top concern of consumers and other stakeholders.   As a baseline , we need to think about how to 
protect the privacy of consumers and businesses , while also establishing an appropriate level of 
transparency that would  deter criminal activity .  
We must ensure that consumer data privacy protections embedded in today’s payment 
systems continue and are extended into future systems .  In thinking about the implications of 
CBDC and privacy, we must also consider the central role  that money plays in our daily lives, 
and the risk that a CBDC would provide not only a window into, but potentially an impediment 
to, the freedom Americans enjoy in choosing  how money and resources are used and invested.  
So, a central consideration must be how a potential U.S. CBDC could incorporate privacy 
considerations into its design, and what technology and policy options could support a robust 
privacy framework .  
The issue of privacy may be less difficult to address in the case of wholesale use case s, in 
which a CBDC would only be used by traditional financial institutions to conduct a limited range 
of financial market transactions.  As with many of these considerations, the purpose and intended 
function of a CBDC has a major impact on its policy and  design considerations.  
Interoperability  and Innovation  
Relatedly, one possible way to design a CBDC could be to focus on providing a 
foundational layer on top of which banks and other eligible institutions could build their own 
technology.  In such an intermediated model, banks and other eligible institutions would build - 10 - 
 
 technology on top of a CBDC  that could be offered to retail cons umers and others to provide 
products and services that may not be available today.  It would be important to understand how 
such a layer would connect or interact with existing and new payments infrastructures.  It is 
useful to consider what types of innov ations this could encourage .  Some of the research on the 
design and functionality of CBDCs contemplates things like increased programmability —
allowing the efficient transfer of money through the use of so-called smart contracts —that could 
improve upon exi sting, regulated forms of money and payments .  These are important questions 
worth exploring, but t hey link  back to the identification of “problems” that a CBDC would be 
designed to solve.  
Unintended Effects  on the U.S. Banking System  
It is also necessary  to consider the potential impacts of a CBDC on  the banking sector .  
Today’s banking system delivers important benefits to our economy and, as I noted earlier , is 
continuing to evolve  through innovations , like the  improved availability of instant payments  
already discussed .    
There are significant risks in adopting a CBDC that cannibalizes rather than complements 
the U.S. banking system.  The U.S. banking system is a mature, well -functioning, effective and 
efficient system .  Banks provid e consumers access to credit and other banking and payments 
services .  Banks also support important public polic ies, including reporting on suspicious or 
criminal activity  through their BSA/AML compliance and reporting.  
More importantly , banks play  an essential role in  the transmission of monetary policy and 
supporting a well -functioning economy and financial system.   If the Federal Reserve were to be 
authorized and directed to implement a  U.S. CBDC , we would need to carefully consider how an 
interm ediated CBDC, with private -sector service providers, could be designed in a way that - 11 - 
 
 maintain s financial institution involvement  and minimiz es disruptions to the financial system .  A 
CBDC, if not properly designed, could disrupt the banking system and lead  to disintermediation, 
potentially harming consumers and businesses , and could present broader financial stability 
risks .11  Consider the consequences of a CBDC  that pays interest at comparable or better rates 
than commercial bank deposits and other low -risk assets .  It seems likely that such a CBDC 
would reduce the funds available to lend and increase the cost of capital  across the economy .  
Likewise, we need to consider the effect on bank stability , and the potential of even more rapid 
bank runs,  in a wor ld where there are fewer constraints on the volume and velocity  of payments .  
The ongoing demand  for private and public options to facilitate instant payments  may exacerbate 
these concerns . 
These are exactly the types of issues that policymakers must confront.  It would be 
irresponsible to undermine the traditional banking system by introducing a CBDC without 
appropriate guardrails to mitigate these potential impacts on the banking sector and the financial 
system.   
The Imperative of Continuing Research  
The Federal Reserve’s work continues to explore an array of CBDC design choices and 
the challenging consideration of policy tradeoffs that this multitude of choices presents.  It is 
imperative that each of these  tradeoffs is carefully evaluated and thoroughly understood.  Where 
opportunities for improvements may exist, we should ask whether a U.S. CBDC is the most

Settlements, “ Central Bank Digital Currencies: Financial Stability Implications  (Basel: BIS, September 2021),

literature.htm . - 12 - 
 
 efficient and effective means to make such improvements , or are there better alternative s, such as 
enhancements to current payment infrastructures ?  Apart from focusing on payments  alone, it is 
also worth considering whether other policies would more effectively target financial inclusion, 
including policies that are beyond the remit of the Federal Reser ve.  And in the absence of a 
CBDC, some of these risks I noted may still exist as the private sector continues to innovate, 
including the risk of substitution from commercial bank deposits to digital wallets, and the 
migration to less regulated digital ass ets, including stablecoins.  With such significant potential 
opportunities, risks, and tradeoffs, it is essential that the Federal Reserve continue to thoroughly 
research and engage with stakeholders to further understand these issues.  Future decisions ab out 
the implementation of technology innovations in money and payments, including a potential U.S. 
CBDC, must be informed by a deep and thorough understanding of potential intended and 
unintended consequences , as well as understanding whether a CBDC would be the most effective 
and efficient means to improve the payment system  and address identified problems . 
The Federal Reserve has continued its independent research and technical 
experimentation on digital inno vations, including digital assets and CBDC.  Specific to CBDC, 
the Federal Reserve established a program of work that aims to (1) carry out policy analysis to 
provide perspectives on issues articulated in the Board’s January 2022 discussion paper; 
(2) cond uct technology research and experimentation to inform potential CBDC designs; and 
(3) invest in engagement with the public, industry, academia, and the public sector to bring along 
stakeholders and obtain needed expertise.  
Concluding Thoughts :  The Potenti al Future of CBDC in the United States  
Of course, as the evolution of money and payments continues, it is important for the 
Federal Reserve to continue looking ahead to anticipate potential changes to money and - 13 - 
 
 payments well into the future.  With this in mind, our  consideration of other potential 
innovations to money and payments, including a potential U.S. CBDC , must  be viewed through 
the lens of whether and how the payment system would be improved beyond what instant 
payment services will achieve.   We sh ould ask  “what current frictions  exist  or may emerge  in the 
payment system that only a CBDC can solve , or that a CBDC can solve most efficiently ?” 
In my view, it is important that the Federal Reserve is a part of the ongoing conversations 
around CBDCs, whe ther or not a CBDC is ultimately created in the United States.  As the 
Federal Reserve continues to monitor developments in other jurisdictions, we will work closely 
with international counterparts on payments innovation, CBDC , and other related topics. Th is 
includes work with multilateral institutions such as the Bank for International Settlements, the 
G7, and the Financial Stability Board, as well as bilateral engagements with other central banks.  
From my perspective , there could be some promise for whole sale CBDCs in the future  
for settlement of  certain financial market transactions  and processing international payments .  
When it comes to some of the broader design and policy issues , particularly those  around 
consumer privacy and impacts on the banking system, it is difficult to imagine a world where the 
tradeoffs between benefits and unintended consequences could justify a direct access CBDC  for 
uses beyond interbank and wholesale transactions .  
It is important that we thoughtfully examine the evolving money and payments landscape 
and digital innovations broadly, including a potential U.S. CBDC.  In addition to understanding 
international approaches to these issues, the Federal Reserve’s research, exper imentation,  and 
outreach to stakeholders help us to gain  important input and perspective on these issues.  Apart 
from th ese ongoing CBDC -related efforts , the Federal Reserve is  committed to the successful 
implementation of FedNow, which is expected to supp ort the broader adoption of instant - 14 - 
 
 payments in the U.S., meaningfully evolving  and upgrading the U.S.  payments infrastructure for 
consumers and businesses.  
Thank you for the opportunity to share my thoughts on these important issues.  ",2023-04-18,bowman

Concluding Remarks by  
 
Ben S. Bernanke  
 
Chairman  
 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  
 
at the 
 
Ceremony Commemorating the Centennial of the Federal Reserve Act  
 
Washington, D.C.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
December 16, 2013  
  
I have been asked to close this ceremony marking the 100th anniversary of the 
signing of the Federal Reserve Act --the law that created the Federal Reserve--by looking 
ahead to the next century.  Given the well -known difficulties that economists have in 
forecasting even the next few quarters, I will happily point out one important advantage 
in making a 100- year forecast, which is that I won’t be around to explain why the 
forecast went wrong.  Our ability to make accurate long -term forecasts is limited, to sa y 
the least.  Nevertheless, I will venture one prediction that I don’t think is too bold, which is this:  The values that have sustained and served the Federal Reserve at its best, and have permitted it to make critical contribution s to the economic health  of our nation 
during the past century, will continue to serve it and the nation well in the century ahead.  
Among the Fed’s most important values is the belief that policymaking should be 
based on dispassionate, objective, and fact -based analysis.  The ide al we seek is a 
combination of the researcher’s intellectual rigor and the ability of the effective policymaker to navigate the messiness of the real world, a world that includes  complex 
institutions and markets, imp erfect and incomplete data, and often -unpredictable human 
behavior .  
Of course, policy analysis and implementation of the highest quality do not just 
happen.  They require professionalism and a  commitment to public service  as 
exemplified by the generations of staff members who have served this institution  so well.  
Without  the expertise and creativity  embodied in the staff, it would have been impossible 
to develop the innovative policies required to meet, in the words of the Federal Reserve Act, the “unusual and exigent circumstances” we confronted during the recent financial crisis.   If there is one thing on which I believe all of us here can agree, it is that  the  - 2 - 
quality of the staff has been a great strength throughout our institution’s history.  
Maintaining that quality and commitment to public service will be essential if the Fed is to have a successful second century.  
 Dispassionate analysis, expertise, and commitment to public service --all are 
values that have served us well.  But one value that strikes me as having been at least as importa nt as any other has been the Federal Reserve’s willingness, during its finest hours, 
to stand up to political pressure and make tough but necessary decisions.  The fight against inflation during Paul and Alan’s times in office was critical for the nation’s  
longer -term prosperity, and it required perseverance in the face of heavy criticism.  I keep 
in my office one of the 2- by-4s mailed to the Fed during Paul’s tenure, which 
communicates  some distinctly unfavorable views of high interest rates and their effe cts.  
More recently, of course, the Federal Reserve took controversial but necessary measures to arrest what was arguably the worst financial crisis in American history, helping to 
avert what likely would have been a much more severe economic downturn than the Great Recession we did experience.  
We have been able to respond nimbly to economic emergencies and make 
difficult choices in part because of our institutional structure --including long terms for 
members of the Board of Governors and diverse regional r epresentation in our 
policymaking Committee --and because of the willingness of policymakers , past and 
present , to do whatever was needed in the longer -run interest of the  economy .  As an 
institution, the Federal Reserve must continue to be willing to make tough decisions, based on objective, empirical analysis and without regard to political pressure.    - 3 - 
But, finally, we must also recognize that the Fed’s ability to m ake and implement 
such decisions ultimately depends on the public’s understanding and accept ance of our 
actions.  For this reason, we must continue to emphasize two other essential values --
transparency and accountability.  We must do all that we can to explain our actions and to 
show how they serve the public interest.  That’s why we must welcome co mmunication, 
broadly defined.  Of course, w e will continue to talk to economists and market 
participants, but that is not enough.  Ultimately, the legitimacy of our policies rests on the understanding and support of the broader American public, whose interests we are working to serve.  The ability of this institution to support a healthy economy --an 
economy with high levels of employment, low inflation, and a stable financial system--will require our continued efforts to engag e in two -way communication --explaining our 
actions and , importantly, listening to what our fellow citizens have to say.  
Let me end by thanking the organizers of this event and, in particular, all of the 
past and present policymakers in attendance for helping us mark this centennial m ilestone 
in such a memorable fashion. ",2013-12-16,bernanke

February 27, 2020 
  
It is a pleasure to be here today.   I appreciate the invitation to speak to you as part 
of this year’s Banking Outlook Conference  at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.1  I 
think this year’s theme, Age of Advancement: The Intricacies of a D igital World , captures 
the dynamic and evolving landscape of our country’s financial system  well .  Advances in 
technology are  occurring  at a rapid pace and present the opportunity to make our 
financial system safer  and more efficient for more Americans .   
From faster payments to artificial intelligence, technological advancements touch 
nearly every aspect of our financial system and affect institutions of every type.  As the 
first Federal Reserve governor to serve in the role designated by Congress for some one 
with community banking experience, I am especially interested in the impact these kinds 
of advancements may have on community banks.  I am  also committed to ensuring that as 
policymakers and supervisors navigate the intricacies of today’s digital world , we do so 
in a way that  considers the important role  of community banks  in cities and towns  and 
rural communities  across the country, and our nation’s financial system more broadly.  
To that end, I believe t he Federal Reserve is well positioned to support  innovation and the 
future of banking in a way that ensures our nation’s evolving financial system works for 
community banks  and the customers they serve.  So I would like to spend my time with 
you today focusing on how the Federal Reserve can achieve this objective in one specific 
area, that of our nation’s payment system.

Importance of Community Banks and the Payment System 
As many of you may know, before joining the Federal Reserve, I was a 
community banker and more recently had the privilege to serve as the Kansas State Bank 
Commissioner.   I have seen firsthand the vital role that our nation’s community banks 
play in the financial industry and in the economy more broadly.   
Through the services  they provide , community banks help support strong cities, 
towns , and rural communities  across the country, which are central to  a vibrant economy.  
For example, small business lending is an essential part of community bank portfolios .  
Many c ommunity banks often specialize in serving small businesses, which accou nt for 
the majority of new job creation in the country.2 In fact, community banks hold 48 
percent of all loans to small businesses and farms in the United States.3    
Community banks are also often seen by their customers as an important source 
of financia l advice and a source of civic leadership.4 Community banks have a deep 
understanding of their local areas .  They also have  close relationships with those living in 
the communities they serve and the organizations that serve th ose communities.  In many 
instances, community banks are also serving markets that tend to be neglected by larger 
banks. These connections allow community banks to focus on specific  local  needs to 
provide a variety of services, which often include  tailored and innovative products .  
Payment services in particular are a key component of these relationships and are

essential to the role of banks in their communit ies.  Community banks help ensur e that 
consumers and businesses can safely and efficiently access and move their money .  By 
doing so, the payment services they provide act as the foundation for  economic activit ies 
that help cities , towns , and rural communities  grow and thrive, which in turn is  essential 
to a strong and stable financial system.  
A strong and stable financial system also depends on the smooth functioning of 
the nation’s payment system.  Today, many Americans take the ability to  move money 
across the country safely and efficiently  for granted , but history shows that payment 
system d isruptions can affect the economy more broadly .5  In the past, our nation’s 
payment system was fragmented and inefficient, creating costs for consumers, merchants, 
banks, and, ultimately, the U.S. economy.  For example, before the Federal Reserve was 
estab lished , check clearing fees and banks’ efforts t o avoid them often led to circuitous 
check routing , with  recipients  facing long, unpredictable delays in receiving their money. 
When they did eventually receive their money, fees had often consumed a consider able 
portion of what they were expect ing.  In extreme instances, this led  to checks moving 
from city to city b efore eventually ending up at their destination.  One often -cited 
example  described a check that started in Rochester , New York , and traveled to 
Jacksonville, Florida, then to Philadelphia, Baltimore , and Cincinnati before it finally 
reached its final destination in Birmingham , Alabama.6  To put that in terms of miles 
traveled , if the check had gone directly from New York to Alabam a, it would have

traveled about 1,000 miles.  Instead,  it traveled 3,000 miles up and down the east coast, 
likely for days , before it finally reached its destination.  The distance from Atlanta to Los 
Angeles is shorter than the route that check took.  
These kinds  of inefficiencies were  so significant that one of Congress’ s 
motivations in creating the Federal Reserve was ensuring a safe and efficient nationwide 
payment infrastructure.  Shortly after they opened for business, the Reserve Banks began 
providing a nationwide check collection service .  This service helped speed up payments 
by reducing circuitous routing. It also facilitated access to  more -efficient payment 
services for banks across the nation. Since then, the Federal Reserve has continued to 
support ongoing efficiency improvements in the nation’s payment system , including the 
development of the Fedwire funds transfer system and  the implementation of the 
automated clearinghouse, or ACH system, in partnership with the private sector.  
This operational role has allowed the Federal Reserve to support the goal  of a safe 
and efficient payment system throughout its history. It has also contributed to widespread 
public confidence in the nation’s  payment infrastructure .  At times, the Federal Reserve 
has taken  extraordinary steps to ensure the  payment system can function reliably.  After 
planes were grounded on September 11, 2001, in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in 
New York and W ashington, D .C., the Federal Reserve arranged alternative transportation 
for millions of checks that normally would have moved across the country by plane .  The 
Federal Reserve also started giving immediate credit for all checks that it received . This 
provided  a key source of liquidity for the payment system and temporarily caus ed the 
daily float held by the Federal Reserve  to increase over 6,000  percent .7 After September

11, the Federal Reserve also took steps to improve the future efficiency of the na tion’s 
check collection system  by working with Congress on the passage of the Check 21 Act in 
2002. 
A safe and efficient payment system also needs to be accessible, because payment 
services are most valuable when you can pay anyone regardless of where bala nces are 
held.  The ultimate success of any effort to modernize the U.S.  payment system depends 
on adoption across the entire banking industry.  Therefore, i n considering the Federal 
Reserve’s provision of payment services, Congress took steps to try to ensure  access to 
services across the country .  As a result , Congress specifically tasked the Federal Reserve 
with taking  into account an adequate level of services nationwide  when providing and 
setting fees for payment services.8  The United States has a highly complex banking 
system with more than 10,000 depository institutions spread over wide areas with 
differing payment needs.9  Over 4,800 of those are community banks .10  In many areas, 
particularly rural areas, community banks may be the primary providers of banking 
services for individuals and small businesses.   Community banks are , therefore , essential 
in ensuring access to safe and efficient payment services in towns , cities, and rural 
communities  nationwide so that payments can move across the count ry regardless of 
geography —from here in the S outh, to the Midwest, and coast to coast.

Community Banks and Payment System Innovation  
A diverse banking system where institutions of all sizes are able to innovate and 
meet evolving customer needs is essential to ensure access to safe, efficient, and modern 
payment services for communities across the nation.  At the Federal Reserve, we supp ort 
the responsible use of technology and innovation to transform the financial system and 
reduce frictions and delays, while preserving consumer protections, data privacy and 
security, and financial stability.  But as technology continues to advance, the intricacies 
of our digital world become more complex, and I believe we  can help ensure that banks 
are well positioned to take advantage of these technology advancements and innovation s.  
Like the rest of the financial industry, community banks are investing in new 
technologies and innovations to meet the growing expectations of their customers.  With 
their considerable understanding of local needs, c ommunity banks  are able to put  these 
kinds of innovations to use in meeting  the specific needs of their commu nities . At the 
Federal Reserve, w e are actively engaging with the banking industry to encourage 
responsible innovation in the community- banking  sector.  
But I also firmly believe that we cannot just say community banks need to  engage 
in responsible innovation, we need to empower community banks to do just that , and I 
am committed to working with my colleagues to realize this objective.  I believe it is our 
responsibility  as a payment service provider and supervisor  to ensure th at our nation’s 
evolving financial system works for community banks .  Because b y empowering them  to 
provide modern and innovative services to their customers , we also ensure that 
Americans across the country can make payments safely  and efficiently .     - 7 - 
First, as a provider of payment services, the Federal Reserve has a long history of 
supporting community banks .  We have long- standing relationships with, and the 
nationwide infrastructure to provide service s to, thousands of community banks across 
the countr y.  While the existing payment infrastructure provided by the Federal Reserve 
has generally served community banks and the nation’s economy well, advances in 
technology have also created opportunities to modernize these  payment services.  
Collectively, these efforts will create a modern payment infrastructure that provides 
community banks  the ability to meet customer expectations in offer ing innovative  
services with the same effectiveness and efficiency as other providers.  This in turn  will 
provide  consumers the ability  to better manage their financial lives by accessing accounts 
when and where they choose and providing more flexibility to manage money and make 
time-sensitive payments.  
To start, the Board has supported changes to existing F ederal Reserve services.  
For example, at the end of last year, the Board announced changes to support adoption of 
an additional same -day ACH window  available later in the day.  When it was adopted in 
2015, same -day ACH allowed for faster processing and re turn of recurring, low -cost 
payments such as payroll and bill payments.  This additional window will help to make 
the benefits of same- day ACH more broadly accessible .  More specifically, it will  allow 
banks and their customers, particularly those located outside the e astern t ime zone , to use 
same- day ACH services during a greater portion of the business day.  
Our modernization efforts do not stop with existing services , though.  T he 
FedNowSM Service, announced last August , will create a new payment infrastructure for 
institutions of all sizes to offer  innovative faster payment services.  Community banks in  - 8 - 
particular were strong supporters  of developing the FedNow S ervice .  Many of them 
emphasized  that the Federal Reserve’s long- standing policy commitment to promoting 
nationwide access would result in a service that is accessible to banks of all sizes. They 
felt that this in turn would ultimately increas e the long- term likelihood of being able to 
offer  faster payment services  in their communities.   Community banks continued to voice 
strong support  in response to our most recent request for comment  on the design of the 
FedNow S ervice.  At the same time, they raised a number of important issues, including 
interoperability, time  to market , and use of volume -based pricing.  These issues ar e 
important to community banks, and as such, they are important to me .  I intend to work 
with my colleagues so that the FedNow Service meets the needs of community banks and 
their customers.  I hope that you will continue to engage with us, continue to provide 
your feedback, and continue to be patient as we undertake this effort to develop the 
FedNow S ervice.   Because with your input , I believe  the Federal Reserve can  continue its  
long history —which  started  with bank notes  and check s, then continued with ACH —of 
providing infrastructure  that supports the independence and success of community banks  
for the long term .   
It is also important to understand that technology  advancements affect  more tha n 
just the payment infrastructure behind- the-scenes.  Innovations in consumer and other 
end-user experiences, such as those facilitated by fintech firms, can also transform the 
way that consumers interact with their financial institutions , offer ing community banks 
additional opportunities to serve their customers in the future.  For instance, I have 
previously discussed how working with fintech firms may offer community banks 
potential partnerships that leverage the latest technology to provide cust omer -first,  - 9 - 
community- focused financial services and provide customers with efficiencies, such as 
easy-to-use online applications or rapid loan decisionmaking.  These kinds of strategic 
partnerships harness the indispensable knowledge and trust that community banks have 
built with retail customers and local small businesses .  For example, w e have seen 
community banks experience significant growth after partner ing with fintech companies 
to offer checking accounts for online investors, personal loans, and debit cards .  We have 
also seen such partnerships increase efficiency in service offerings, such as significantly 
reducing loan approval processing time.  We expect that  the efforts to modernize our 
payment infrastructure  that I outline d earlier , such as FedN ow, will serve as a foundation  
for this kind of  innovation to  flourish, and will support  new opportunities for community 
banks and the communities they serve. 
Of course, new technology is also subject to many of the traditional risks banks 
have managed in the past with more -traditional consumer services, and implementation 
of new technology should be driven by banks’ business strategies and customer needs.  
Ultimately, banks remain responsible for conducting due diligence and understanding the 
risks faced by their organization.  But technology advances quickly, and new 
developments  inevitably raise new questions. That is why I believe that the Federal 
Reserve also  needs to take steps as a supervisor to ensure our nation’s evolving financial 
system works for community banks .  
First and foremost , it is essential we continue  to meaningfully engage with 
stakeholders  on these issues.  For example, we recently la unched an innovation web  page  
(www.federalreserve.gov/innovate) that will serve as an accessible central hub for 
stakeholders interested in learning about and engaging with the Federal Reserve on  - 10 - 
innovation- related matters.11  The web page can serve as a st arting point for members of 
the industry to engage with Federal Reserve specialists, submit questions, and request in-
person meetings.  We  also announced a series of “fintech innovation office hours” across 
the country.  The first of these was held just yesterday here in Atlanta, and some of you 
may have even had the opportunity to participate.  These are also an important 
opportunity for us to learn, and I encourage you to provide your feedback.  For 
community banks and their potential fintech partners, I hope that these sessions will serve 
as a resource to meet one- on-one with Federal Reserve staff members with relevant 
expertise, discuss fintech developments, share specific projects, and ask questions. They 
also provide us an opportunity to hear directly from banks and fintech companies about 
challenges to innovation.  
Another important area of focus for me is  community banks’ relationships with 
their vendors and third -party service providers.  As a former community banker, I am 
acutely aware that community banks are often reliant on outside service providers and 
vendors to access new technologies and provide payment services .  I also know that 
supervisory expectations in these areas can be challenging, and I have experienced it 
myself .  There  are several things I believe we can do to help provide clarity and 
transparency, reduce confusion, and simplify and remove some of the burden community 
banks face in this area . 
First, in order to give community banks a better picture of what success in due 
diligence of third -party providers looks like, and where it begins and ends, I believe that 
we should release more information on its necessary elements. This change would 
                                                 
11 See https://www.federalreserve. gov/aboutthefed/innovation.htm .  - 11 - 
provide clarity and assist community banks in completing their work. In particular , I 
believe that regulators can provide more clarity on the types of questions that should be 
asked of a prospective third- party provider and our view of a satisfactory answer .  I also 
believe our guidance should explain what due diligence looks like for a  potential fintech 
partner, because the standards applied to other third parties may not be universally 
applicable.  Potential partnerships are not one -size- fits-all.  Every bank has different 
objectives, and guidance should reflect some supervisory flexibility so that we do not 
impede prudent, strategic partnerships between community banks and potential partners. 
Regulators should especially support partnerships that combine the strengths of 
community banks and fintech companies, which have a track record of success.  I also 
believe the Federal Reserve should allow banks to conduct shared due diligence on 
potential partners.  If several banks use the same third -party service provider and are 
open to collaborating, they should be allowed to pool resources instead of duplicating one 
another’s work.  These approaches would not only have the benefit of increasing clarity 
and transparency for community banks, but could also be beneficial for fintech 
companies that hope to become third- party providers.  
Second, c lear and transparent guidance is most helpful  when it is consistent .  I 
have previously discussed my view that guidance on third -party relationships  should be 
consistent across banking agencies.  No one benefits when banks and their potential 
partners or other vendors have to navigate unnecessary differences in guidance between  
agencies. To that end, the Federal Reserve is in the process of working with the other 
banking agencies to update our thir d-party guidance.  As part of this process, I believe 
that the banking agencies should all have consistent expectations for third -party  - 12 - 
relationships, and that the Federal Reserve should, as a starting point, move toward 
adopting the Office of the Comptrol ler of the Currency’s guidance.  
Third , I believe we can improve transparency with regard to our supervision of 
third parties.   Through our service provider  supervision program, we regularly conduct 
exams of many third -party service providers.  While we make the outcomes available to 
banks that are clients of a supervised service provider, I believe we can go a step further 
to increase transparency by also making information that may be useful about our 
supervision of key service providers available to banks . This could take a number of 
forms, such as being more transparent about who and what we evaluate. Of course, 
moving forward in these areas requires careful consideration and interagency 
collaboration, and I have asked our staff to work with other agencie s to develop and 
propose workable options for giving banks the benefit of the knowledge that supervisors 
have about their potential providers in an appropriate manner.    
Finally , I believe regulators and supervisors have a role to play in ensuring that 
regulatory burden is tailored to bank size, risk, complexity, and capacity. Knowing the 
burden that third -party  monitoring in particular can present to employees of the smallest 
banks, I have also encouraged Federal Reserve staff to consider options for fu rther 
tailoring our expectations for community banks with assets under $1 billion in this area. 
Collectively , I view  these as important steps to improve  the ability of community 
banks to manage their third -party  relationships effectively .  By doing so, I believe we will 
be able to better support the  ability  of community banks to access innovative new  
technology and offer modern services to customers .  - 13 - 
Looking Ahead  
The kinds of advances in technology we are discussing here today present 
challenges and opportunities for banks of all sizes, including community banks.  
Investments in new technology are likely to create implementation costs, and payment 
system innovations are no exception.  Testing new technology, upgrading software and 
process ing systems, and integrating new systems with existing systems will require banks 
to incur costs and dedicate resources to implementation.  C ommunity banks in particular 
may incur additional costs , for example  to extend operating hours in order to facilita te 
payments during nonstandard business hours.   
However,  technological advances also present opportunities for community banks 
to continue serving their neighbors , and  payment services are a key component of this .  
Since I joined the Federal Reserve, I ha ve been on the road a lot , visiting Federal Reserve 
Districts and talking to bankers, consumers, and community groups.  I have been struck 
in particular by stories I have heard about younger generations of Americans moving 
back to rural areas.  These indiv iduals may be returning  to their hometown or moving out 
of urban centers, but they still have the same expectations for services like those that may 
be offered by larger banks with nationwide footprints.  Technological developments , like 
the payment system modernization efforts we have discussed today , allow banks across 
the country to meet these customer expectations and provide payment services on a 
competitive basis.  
I believe the Federal Reserve is uniquely positioned  as a provider of pay ment 
services and as a supervisor of banks to ensure  that our nation’s evolving financial system 
works for community banks .  As a provider of payment services, our efforts to modernize  - 14 - 
the nation’s payment system through services like FedNow and same -day A CH will 
ensure community banks and their customers have access to today’s financial technology 
nationwide.  As a supervisor  of banks , we can support responsible innovation by reducing 
regulatory burden where we can, clarifying expectations, and improving t he ability of 
community banks to manage their relationships effectively .  Collectively, I believe these 
efforts will help support a community banking sector that is well positioned to thrive and 
offer modern, innovat ive services  to their customers.  By providing such services, 
community banks can  help ensure all Americans can make payments safely and 
efficiently regardless of their location and that families across the country have access to 
financial services that are so important to their success and the success of our 
communities in today’s age of advancement. ",2020-02-27,bowman

Getting Back to a Strong Labor Market  
   
Remarks by 
 
Jerome H. Powell  
 
Chair  
 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  
 
at 
 
The Economic Club of New York  
 
(via webcast)  
       
February 10, 20 21 
  
Today I will discuss the state of our labor market, from the recent past  to the 
present and then over the longer term.   A strong labor market that is sustained for an 
extended period can deliver substantial economic and social benefits, including higher 
employment and income  levels, improved and expanded job opportunities, narrow er 
economic disparities, and healing of the entrenched  damage inflicted by past recessions 
on individuals’ economic and personal well -being .  At present, we are a long way from 
such a labor market.  Fully realizing the benefits of a strong labor market will take continued support from both near -term policy and longer -run investments so that all those 
seeking jobs have the skills and opportunities that will enable them to contribute to, and share in, the  benefits of prosperity.   
The L abor Market of a Y ear A go  
We need only look to February of last year  to see how beneficia l a strong labor 
market  can be .  The overall unemployment rate was 3.5 percent, the lowest level in a 
half-century .  The unemployment rate for African Americans had also reached historical 
lows ( figure  1).  Prime -age labor force participation was the highest in over a decade, and 
a high proportion of households saw jobs as “plentiful.”
1  Overall wage growth was 
moderate, but wages were rising more rapidly for earners on the lower end of the scale .  
These encouraging statistics were reaffirmed and given voice by those we met and 
conferred with, including  the community, labor, and business leaders ; retirees;  students ; 
and others we met with during the 1 4 Fed Listens events we conducted in 2019.2   
                                                 
1 Data from the Conference Board’s “Jobs Are Plentiful” series (February 2020).   For more on the 
Conference Board, see https://www.conference -board.org . 
2 Another Fed Listens  event was held in 2020 to discuss  the effects of the COVID -19 pandemic.  For a 
summary of all of the Fed Listens  events, see the report  Fed Listens:  Perspectives from the Public,  
available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/fedlistens -report -
20200612.pdf .  - 2 - 
Many of the se gains had emerged only in the la ter years of the expansion .  The  
labor force participation rate, for example , had been steadily declining from 2008 to 2015 
even as the recovery from the G lobal F inancial Crisis unfolded.  In  fact, in 2015, prime -
age labor force participation —which I focus on because it is not significantly affected by  
the aging of the population—reached its  lowest level in 30 years even as the 
unemployment rate declined to a relatively low 5 percent .  Also concerning was  that 
much of the decline in participation up to that point had been concentrated in the 
population without a college degree (figure  2).  At the time, many forecasters worried  
that globalization and technological change might have permanently reduced job 
opportunities f or these individuals , and that, as a result, there might be  limited  scope for 
participation to recover.   
Fortunately, the participation rate after 2015 consistently outperformed 
expectations , and by the beginning of 2020, the prime -age participation rate had fully 
reversed its  decline from  the 2008- to-2015 period .  Moreover, gains in participation were 
concentrated among people  without a college degree.  Given that U.S. labor force 
participation has lagged relative to other advanced economy nations , this progress was 
especially welcome (figure 3) .3    
As I mentioned, we also saw f aster wage growth for low earners once the labor 
market ha d strengthened sufficiently.  Nearly six years into the recovery, wage growth 
for the lowest earning quartile had been persistently modest and well below the pace 
enjoyed by other workers.  At the tipping point of 2015, however , as the labor market

continued to strengthen, the trend reversed, with wage growth for the lowest quartile 
consistently and significantly exceed ing that of other workers  (figure  4).   
At the end of 2015, the Black unemployment rate was still quite elevated, at 
9 percent, despite the relatively low overall unemployment rate.  But that disparity too 
began to shrink; as the expansion continued beyond 2015, Black unemployment reached 
a historic low of 5.2 percent, and the gap between Black and white unemployment rates 
was the narrowest since 1972, when data on unemployment by race started to be  
collected .  Black unemployment has tended to rise more than o verall unemployment in 
recessions but also to fall more quickly in expansions.4  Over the course of a long 
expansion, these persistent disparities can decline  significantly , but, without policies to 
address their underlying causes,  they may increase again  when the economy ultimately 
turns down.    
These late -breaking improvements in the labor market did not result in unwanted 
upward pressures on inflation, as might have been expected ; in fact, i nflation  did not even 
rise to 2 percent  on a sustained basis .  There was every reason to expect that the labor 
market c ould have strengthened  even further without causing a worrisome increase in 
inflation were  it not for the onset of the pandemic .

The L abor Market T oday  
The state of  our labor market  today could hard ly be more different.  Despite the 
surprising speed of  recovery early on , we are still very far from a strong labor market 
whose benefits are broadly shared.  Employment in January of this year was  nearly 
10 million below its  February 2020 level, a greater shortfall than the worst of  the Great 
Recession ’s aftermath  (figure 5) . 
After rising to 14.8 percent in April  of last year , the published unemployment rate 
has f allen relatively swiftly , reach ing 6.3 percent in January .  But  published 
unemployment rates during COVID have dramatically understated the deterioration in the 
labor market.  Most  importantly, the pandemic  has led t o the largest 12 -month decline  in 
labor force participation  since at least 1948.5  Fear of the virus an d the disappearance of 
employment opportunities in the sectors most affected by it, such as  restaurants , hotels, 
and entertainment  venues, have led many to withdraw from the workforce.  At the same 
time,  virtual schooling has forced many parents to leave t he work force to provide all -day 
care for their children.  A ll told , nearly 5 million people  say the pandemic prevented them 
from looking for work in January.  In addition, t he Bureau of L abor S tatistics  reports that 
many unemployed individuals have been misclassified as employed.  Correcting this misclassification and c ounting those who have left the labor force since last February as 
unemployed  would boost the unemployment rate to close to 10  percent in  January 
(figure  6). 
Unfortunately, even those grim statistics understate the decline in labor market 
conditions for the most economically vulnerable Americans.  Aggregate employment has 
                                                 
5 Published monthly data on labor force participation begin in 1948.   - 5 - 
declined 6.5  percent since last February, but the decline in employme nt for workers in the 
top quartile of the wage distribution has been only 4 percent , while the decline for the 
bottom quartile has been a staggering 17 percent ( figure  7).  Moreover, employment for 
these workers has changed little in recent months, while e mployment for the higher -wage 
groups has continued to improve.  Similarly, the unemployment r ates for Blacks and 
Hispanics have risen significantly more than for whites  since February 2020 ( figure  8).  
As a result, economic disparities that were already too wide  have widened further.  
In the past few months, improvement in labor market conditions stalled as the rate 
of infections  sharply increased .  In particular, jobs in the leisure and hospitality se ctor 
dropped over  1/2 million in December and a further 61,000 in January.  The recovery 
continues to depend on controlling the spread of the virus, which will require  mass 
vaccinations  in addition to continued vigilance in social distancing and mask weari ng in 
the meantime.  
Since the onset of the pandemic, we have been concerned about its longer -term 
effects on the labor market.  Extended periods of unemployment can inflict persistent 
damage on lives and livelihoods  while also eroding the productive capac ity of the 
economy.6  And w e know from the previous expansion that it can take many years to 
reverse the  damage.

At the start of the pandemic , the increase in unemployment was almost entirely 
due to temporary job loss es.7  Temporarily laid -off workers tend to  return to work much 
more quickly, on average, than those whose ties to their former employer s are 
permanently severed.  But as some sectors of the economy have continued to struggle , 
permanent job loss has increased  (figure  9).  So too has long -term un employment.  Still, 
as of January, the level of permanent job loss, as a fraction of the labor force, wa s 
considerably smaller than during the Great Recession.  Research shows that the Paycheck 
Protection Program has played an important role in limiting pe rmanent layoffs and 
preserving small businesses.8  The renewal of the program this year in the face of another 
surge in COVID- related job cuts is  an encouraging development.  
Of course, in a  healthy market -based economy, perpetual churn will always 
render  some jobs obsolete as they are  replaced by new employment opportunities .  Over 
time, w orkers and capital move from firm to firm and from sector to sector .  It is likely 
that the pandemic has  both increased the need for such movements and brought forward 
some movement  that would have occurred eventually.9   
                                                 
7 The Bureau of Labor Statistics defines a job loss as temporary if the affected worker has been given a date 
to return to work or expects to be recalled to their former job within six months.

Getting B ack to a S trong L abor M arket  
So how do we get from where we are today back to a strong labor market that 
benefits all Americans and that starts to heal the damage already  done?  And what can we 
do to sustain  those benefits over time ?  Experience tells us that get ting to and staying at 
full employment  will not be  easy .  In the near term, polic ies that  bring the pandemic to an 
end as soon as possible are paramount .  In addition, w orkers and households who struggle 
to find their place in the post -pandemic economy are likely to need continued support.  
The same is true for many small businesses that  are likely  to prosper again once the 
pandemic is behind us.   
Also important is a patie ntly accommodative  monetary policy stance that 
embraces the lessons of the past —about the labor market in particular and the economy 
more generally.  I described several of those important lessons , as well as our new policy 
framework, at the  Jackson Hole c onference  last year.10  I have  already mentioned the 
broad- based benefits that a strong labor market can deliver and noted that many of these 
benefits only arose toward the end of the previous expansion.  I also noted that these 
benefits were achieved with low inflation.  Indeed, inflation has been much lower and 
more stable over the past three decades than in earlier times.  
In addition, we  have  seen  that the longer -run potential growth rate of the economy 
appear s to be lower than it once was, in part because of  population aging, and that the 
neutral rate of interest— or the rate consistent with the economy being at full employment 
with 2  percent inflation —is also much lower than before.  A low neutral rate means t hat 
                                                 
10 See Jerome H. Powell (2020), “New  Economic Challenges and the Fed’s Monetary Policy Review,” 
speech delivered at “Navigating the Decade Ahead:  Implications for Monetary Policy,” a symposium 
sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson Hole, Wyo., August 27, 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm .  - 8 - 
our policy rate will be constrained more often by the effective lower bound.  That  
circumstance can lead to worse economic outcomes—particularly for the most 
economically vulnerable Americans.   
To take these economic developments into account, we made  substantial revisions 
to our monetary policy framework, as described in the FOMC’s S tatement on L onger -
Run G oals and M onetary P olicy S trategy.11  This revised statement shares many features 
with its predecessor, including our view that longer -run inflation of 2  percent is most 
consistent with our mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.  But it also has some innovations. 
The revised statement emphasizes that maximum employment is a broad and 
inclusive goal.  This change reflects our apprec iation for the benefits of a strong labor 
market, particularly for many in low - and moderate -income communities.  R ecognizing 
the economy’s ability to sustain a robust job market without causing an unwanted 
increase in  inflation, the statement says that ou r policy decisions will be informed by our 
“assessments of the shortfalls  of employment from its maximum level” rather than by 
“deviations  from its maximum level. ”
12  This means that we will not tighten monetary 
policy solely in response to a strong labor market.  Finally, to counter  the adverse 
economic dynamics that could ensue from declines in inflation expectations in an 
environment where our main policy tool is more frequently constrained, we now  
explicitly  seek to achieve inflation that averages 2  percent over time.   This means that 
following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, 
                                                 
11 The FOMC’s Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, revised in August 2020 and 
reaffirmed in January,  is available on the Board’s website at 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf . 
12 Italics added for empha sis.  See Powell, “New Economic Challenges,” p. 11, in note 10.  - 9 - 
appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 
2 percent for some time in the service of keeping inflation expectations well anchored at our 2 percent longer -run goal . 
Our January postmeeting statement on monetary policy implements  this new 
framework.
13  In particular, we expect that it will be appropriate to maintain the current 
accommodative target range of the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.  In addition, we will  
continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage -backed 
securities by $80 billion and $40 billion per month, respectively, until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.  
The B road Responsibility for A chieving M aximum E mployment  
Seventy- five years ago, in the wake of WWII, the U nited S tates faced the 
challenge of reemploying millions amid a major restructuring of the economy toward peacetime ends.
14  Part of Congress ’s response was the Employment Act of 1946, which 
states that “it is the continuing policy and responsibility of the federal government to use all practicable means . . . to promote maximum employment.”
15  As later amended  in the 
Humphrey- Hawkins Act , this pr ovision formed the basis of the  employment side of the

Fed’s dual mandate .  My colleagues and I are strongly committed to doing all we can to 
promote this employment goal.   
Given the number of people who have lost their jobs and the likelihood that some 
will struggle to find work in the post -pandemic economy, achieving and sustaining 
maximum employment will require more than supportive monetary policy.  It will require 
a society -wide commitment, with contributions from across government and the private 
sector.  The potential benefits of investing in our nation’s workforce are immense.  Steady employment provides more than a regular paycheck.  It also bestows a sense of purpose, improves mental health, increases lifespans, and benefits workers and their families.
16  I am confident that with our collective efforts across the government and the 
private sector, our nation will make sustained progress toward our national goal of maximum employment.

Women’s History Month Reception

  -2- 
It’s an honor and a pleasure for me to be here with you to mark Women’s History Month, 
which itself has some history behind it.  
March 8, 1911 was the first International Women’s Day, and it was 1980 when President 
Carter established National Women’s Histo ry Week.  In 1987, Congress acted to make that week 
a full month.    
Women, of course, are also a part of history for the other 11 months of the year.  And I 
would add that women were influencing the course of history long before 1980, or 1911.  But I 
am g lad that there is, each year, a time when we pause to think about the role of women, because 
history is more than simply what happened, and more than what women and men did to make it happen.   
History is what we remember about those deeds.  It is the less ons we have taken from the 
past and the knowledge we draw on to live today and to shape the future.   
For me, one lesson from history is that it is no coincidence that America’s great success 
in the past century came as women steadily increased their parti cipation in every aspect of 
society.  Starting with gaining the vote, just a few years before International Women’s Day, “The American Century,” as it’s sometimes known, was also a century of progress for women.  Fundamental to our country’s values, to those ideals that have been and continue to be so influential around the world, is the principle of equality for all, including for women.   
One reason America’s example is influential elsewhere is because progress toward these 
ideals has been accompanied by great success in broadly raising living standards.  And I think 
our economic success has been due in substantial part to the fuller participation and contribution of women to the economy.  Their increasing participation in the workforce, particularly after   -3- 
1970, was a major factor in sustaining growing family incomes.  Making fuller use of the talents 
and efforts of women in the workplace has made us more productive and prosperous.      
If I were to apply this lesson, I would hope that our nation continues to reap the benefits 
of greater participation by women in the economy and that we do everything that we can to foster that participation.  Women have made great progress in many occupations and professions, but lag in others.  In my own profession, there has been a gradual increase in the share of women in economics, but women still remain underrepresented at the highest levels in academia, in government and in business.  There are doubtless numerous reasons for this, and in fact economists themselves are among those engaged in trying to understand the factors that explain why more women aren't rising to higher levels.     
I hope we continue to seek this understanding, in my field and others where women are in 
the minority, because the benefits of greater pa rticipation for women, it seems to me, are clear 
and substantial.  As we continue to make progress in recovering from the Great Recession, our 
country is going to need the best efforts, ideas and talent it can muster to succeed in an increasingly competitive global economy.   If women’s history can shape the future, I hope that it inspires America to take those steps we can take to draw forth these contributions from all Americans.

March  14, 2012   
I’m glad to have the chance to speak again  to the Independent Community 
Bankers of America , even if it’s by way of  prerecorded  remarks .  This will be the first 
time in quite a few years that I haven’t been with you in person, but , as you may know , 
the Federal Open Market Committee me t just yester day in Washington , so I am unable to 
join you in Nashville.  I have very much enjoyed attending these annual ICBA get-
togethers , especially since I get the chance to hear directly from you about what’s 
happening in your local economies and in community ban king more generally.  It’s a 
tradition I hope to reestablish  in the future.  
The Role of Community Bank s in a Challenging  Economy  
Comm unity  banks  remain a critical component of our financial system and our 
economy.  They  help keep their local economies  vibrant  and growing  by taking on and 
managing the risks of local lending, which larger banks may be unwilling or unable to do .  
They often respond with greater agility to lending requests than their national competitors 
because of their detailed knowledge of  the needs of their customers and their close ties to  
the communities they serve .  
As you well know, however, community banks are also facing difficult 
challenges.  Their close ties to local economies are , on balance , a source of strength , but a 
drawback  of those ties is  that the fortunes of communities and their banks tend to rise and 
fall together.  A nother concern for community banks is the narrowing of the range of 
their profitable lending activities:  B ecause larger banks have used their scale to gai n a 
pricing advantage in volume -driven businesses such as consumer lending , community 
banks have tended to specialize in other areas , such as loans secured by commercial real - 2 - 
 
 estate .  That said, I know that community banks are continuing to look for ways  to 
prudently diversify their revenue sources.    
Like larger banks, community banks are also being affected by the state of the 
national economy.  Despite some recent signs of improvement, the recovery has been 
frustratingly slow, constraining opportunities for profitable lending.  A nd, a s I will 
discuss momentarily , actual and prospective changes in the regulatory landscape have 
also raised concerns among community bankers.  
The good news is that, f or the most part, community banks appear to be meeting 
their challenges.  Profits of smaller banks were considerably higher in 2011 than in the 
previous year , nonperforming assets were lower , provisions for loan losses  fell 
appreciably , and  capital ratios improved . 
Outreach and Communication  with Community Banks  
As I noted , together with economic conditions, regulation and supervision are 
among the top concerns for community banks.  In that regard, I think we would all agree 
that two-way communic ation between regulators  and community banks is cri tical.  Banks 
need to  understand supervisors’ policies and expectations, but supervisors must also 
listen  to and understand  banks’ concerns . 
At the Federal Reserve, w e pursue our dialogue with community bankers t hrough 
many channels.  One important channel is  the recently esta blished Community 
Depository Institutions Advisory Council (CDIAC) .1  The council’s  membership is 
drawn from smaller banks, credit unions, and savings associations .  Each  of the 
12 Reserve Bank s around the country  has a local advisory council, and one representative

Advisory Council” available at www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/cdiac.htm.  - 3 - 
 
 from each local council serves on the national council that meets with the Board in 
Washington twice a year.    
At a recent meeting, for example, one of our CDIAC members asked us to be 
clearer about whether particular rules  and guidance apply to community banks.  Having 
heard from this banker as well as others, w e are now working  to more explicitly indicate 
which banks will be affected when we issue new  regulatory proposal s, final rule s, or 
regulatory  guidance.  Although this change seems relatively simple, we hope it will help 
banks avoid allocating precious resources to poring over supervisory guidance  that do es 
not apply to them.  
In addition to the advisory  council, the Board  last year established a  supervision 
subcommittee  on smaller regional and community banking.  Because of their professional 
backgrounds in community banking and bank supervision, I asked Governors Elizabeth 
Duke and Sarah Bloom Raskin to serve on this subcommittee.  Its primary  role is to 
improve our understanding of community and regional banking conditions and to review 
policy proposals for their potential effect on the safety and soundness of, and the 
regulatory costs imposed on, community and regional institutions.2  Governors  Duke and 
Raskin are also keenly interested in how our policies could a ffect the availability of credit 
to sound borrowers.  
We have other contacts with community banks that have proved valuable.  For 
quite a few  years, the Reserve Banks have maintained local training and outreach 
programs for banks.  More recently, several of these programs have been expanded 
                                                           
2 For the purposes of the Federal Reserve’s supervisory programs, regional bankin g organizations generally 
are considered to be those banks and bank holding companies (inc luding savings and loan holding 
companies) with total consolidated assets between $10 billion and $50 billion.   - 4 - 
 
 nationally.  For example , the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis organizes national “Ask 
the Fed”  calls to provide bankers with an opportunity to hear Federal Reserve staff 
discuss recent policy initiatives and issues  that examiners are encountering  in the field .  
In addition, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco hosts consumer compliance 
webinars , and th e Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia publishes a quarterly overview 
of consumer compliance issues that allow s Federal Reserve staff to address questions 
from banks .3  We are exploring  options for building on  these initiatives.   It is critical to 
keep the  communications channels open if supervisors and banks are to work together 
constructively.    
The Regulation and Supervision of Community Banks  
Bank supervision requires a delicate balance --particularly now.  The weak 
economy, together with loose lending s tandards in the past, has put pressure on the entire 
banking industry, including community banks.  To protect banks from new problems 
down the road, and to safeguard the Deposit Insurance Fund, supervisors must insist on 
high standards for lending, risk ma nagement, and governance .  At the same time, it is 
important for banks, for their communities, and for the national economy that banks lend 
to creditworthy borrowers.  Lending to creditworthy borrowers, after a ll, is how banks 
earn profits.  
We also know  that supervis ion impose s costs on  institutions , and we recognize 
that new regulations and supervisory requirements may impose  disproportionate costs on 
community banks.  Thus , we take quite seriously the importance of evaluating the costs

Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s webpage “Consumer Compliance Outlook” available at

 and benefits  of new rules .  Supervision is conducted through t he Federal Reserve’s 
decentralized structure of 12 regional Reserve Banks, which helps us  tailor  our 
examination s and supervision to the size , complexity , risk profile, and business model  of 
each institution .   
Community bankers  tell us repeatedly that they are concerned about the changing 
regulatory environment .  One particular worry is the implement ation of  the Dodd -Frank 
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd -Frank Act) .  It is important to 
emphasize  that the Congress enacted the Dodd -Frank Act  largely in response to  the “too  
big to fail” problem, and that most  of its provisions --regarding, for example, capital, 
liquidity, and risk management --apply only , or principally,  to the largest , most complex, 
and internationally active  banks .  These new standards are not meant to apply to, and 
clearly would not be appropriate for,  community banks .  We will work to maintain a clear 
distinction between community banks and larger institutions in the application of new 
regulations.   
Conclusion  
To conclude, I would like to reemphasize the importance  that my colleagues on 
the Board and I place on  the Federal Reserve’s  relationship with community banks.  The 
Fed is committed to fair, consistent, and informed examinations that take into account the 
size, complexity, and individual circumstances of each bank we ov ersee .  We will do all 
we can to  support the banks’  safety and soundness and eliminate  unnecessary costs.   
Despite economic uncertainties, the condition of community banks  is improving .  That’s 
good news not only for banks, but for their communities and the national economy as 
well.   Thanks, and enjoy the rest of your meetings.  ",2012-03-14,bernanke

Conversation with the Chair: A Teacher Town Hall Meeting  
  
Washington, D.C. (and by webcast)  
          
September 28, 2023 
  
Thank you, Sarah , thank you to those in Fed Education who helped put together 
this event, and thank you to the teachers here and online who have put aside some  of their 
planning time to listen and, I hope, also participate.  I f I were doing the grading, credit 
would always be granted for participation.  
We have  scheduled this discussion with teachers well into the school year, partly 
to highlight the beginning, on Oct ober 1, of Economic Education Month.  At the Fed, 
every month is Economic Education Month, and we are glad to join in the celebration.  
It is, fortunately, a very different time for teachers  than the one we faced in 
August 2021, the last time we held this discussion with educators.  In the crisis of the 
pandemic, teachers were on the front lines.  I know how overwhelming th is challenge 
was for many of you, and the extent of your sacrifice , for which I thank you.   
And the  crisis in many ways continues, as research confirm s the educational 
deficits that students still suffer from the pandemic.  In addition to the challenges they 
face, there are likely to b e consequences for the economy and for society, in a generation 
of young people who may lack some of what they need to be well -informed and engaged 
participants in our economy and our democracy.   Addressing this legacy of the pandemic 
is a major public pol icy challenge,  so now more than ever, teachers are crucial to 
America’s future.    
A large majority of you are economic educators, a role that is of particular 
importance.  As many of you know, the Fed’s ability to influence the economy depends 
to some extent on influenc ing the public’s view of current and future economic 
conditions.  When my colleagues and I publish our projections for the most likely path 
for the economy and interest rates , as we did a couple of  weeks ago, one of our goal s is to  - 2 - 
influence spending and investment decisions today and in the months ahead.  T hat will 
only be the case if people understand what we are saying and what it means for their own 
finances.   
That’s where you come in.  By educ ating students about economics, not only are 
you providing them with valuable skills to manage their finances , and to improve their 
chances for future success in any number of occupations that draw on economic thinking.  
You are also giving them the knowle dge that they need to understand the macroeconomy, 
including the implications of decisions that the Fed makes.  E conomic educators impart 
knowledge that is instrumental in how the Federal Reserve promotes a healthy economy.  
In a way, when you are teaching students , you are  also conducting monetary policy.   
But you do a lot more than that.  Teachers  illuminate the world for us.  They help 
us to see the limitless possibilities in life, and as much as that, also in ourselves.  At a wonderful but also very vulnerable time in each of our lives, teachers like you are there to 
help us understand the world, especially when it is hard to understand.  I will leave you 
with one of the many examples I could cite from my time in school.  I can clearly recall one November day, in fifth grade, at Blessed Sacrament School here in Washington, D.C.    
My teacher Mrs. Keller was called away from class.  I adored Mrs. Keller , and when she 
returned  to the room , I think every student was as upset as I was to see her tear -streaked  
face.  And then we got the news —President John F. Kennedy had been shot and killed in 
Dallas.  This was something that was very hard for my classmates and me to understand, 
but Mrs. Keller pulled herself together and convinced us that , somehow, everything was 
going to be all right.  Teachers are there for all of us, when we need your  knowledge, 
your example, your encouragement, and your care.  Thank you for playing the  - 3 - 
indispensable role you do in our lives, and in our children’s lives.  And now, I would be 
very happy to respond to your questions.

Communication and Monetary Policy  
   
Remarks by  
 
Ben S. Bernanke  
 
Chairman  
 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  
 
at the 
 
National Economists Club Annual Dinner  
Herbert Stein Memorial Lecture  
Washington, D.C. 
 
 
     
November 19, 2013  
  
Nearly eight years ago, when I began my time as Chairman, one of my priorities 
was to make the Federal Reserve more transparent --and, in particular, to make monetary 
policy as transparent and open as reasonably possible.  I believed then, as I do today, that 
transparency in monetary policy enhances public understanding and confidence, promotes informed discussion of policy options, increases the accountability of monetary policymakers  for reaching their mandated objectives, and ultimately makes policy more 
effective by tightening the linkage between monetary policy, financial conditions, and the real economy.  Of course, responding to the financial crisis and its aftermath soon became the Federal Reserve’s main focus.  As it has turned out, however, following the stabilization of the financial system, supporting our economy’s recovery from the deepest recession since the Great Depression has required a more prominent role for communicat ion and transparency in monetary policy than ever before.   
In my remarks, I will discuss how the Federal Reserve’s communications have 
evolved in recent years and how enhanced transparency is increasing the effectiveness of monetary policy.  Despite the challenges inherent in communicating in an unprecedented economic and policy environment about a future that can be only imperfectly foreseen, I 
will explain why I believe that policy transparency remains an essential element of the Federal Reserve’s strate gy for meeting its economic objectives.  
Policy Frameworks and Communication  
To understand the critical  role that the Federal Reserve’s communication s about 
monetary policy has played in recent years, it is useful to start by discussing the role of monetar y policy communication more g enerally, including the relationship between 
policy communication and the broader policy framework.   - 2 - 
Making monetary policy is sometimes compared to driving a car, with 
policymakers pressing on the accelerator or the brakes, dep ending on whether the 
economy needs to be sped up or slowed down at that moment.  That analogy is imperfect , 
however, for at least two reasons.  First, the main effects of monetary policy actions on 
the economy are not felt immediately but instead play out  over quarters or even years.  
Hence, unlike the driver of a car, monetary policymakers can not simply respond to what 
lies immediately in front of them but must try to look well ahead --admittedly, a difficult 
task.  Second, the effec ts of monetary policy on the economy today  depend importantly 
not only on current policy actions , but also on the public’s expectations of how policy 
will evolve.  The automotive analogy clearly breaks down here, for it is as if the  current 
speed of the car depended on what the car itself expects the driver to do in the future .  
The public’s expectations about future monetary policy actions matter today 
because those expectations have important effects on current financial conditions, which 
in turn affect output, employment, and inflation over time.  For example, because investors  can choose freely between holding a longer -term security or rolling over a 
sequence of short -term securities, longer -term interest rates today are closely linked to 
market participants’ expectations of how short -term rates will evolve.  If monetary 
policy makers are expected to keep short -term interest rates low, then current longer -term 
interest rates are likely to be low as well, all else being equal.  In short, for monetary 
policy, expectations matter.  
Indeed, expectations matter so much that a central b ank may be able to help make 
policy mo re effective by working to shape those expectations.  Experience demonstrates 
that a  useful  approach to managing expectations --one that dovetails well with basic  - 3 - 
principles of transparency --involves policymakers statin g clear objectives  as well as  their  
plans for attaining those objectives.  For example, over the past two decades, many 
central banks have introduced explicit numerical targets for inflation.  Supplemented by regular publication of the central bank’s economic forecasts and provisional plans for achieving its objective in the medium term, numerical inflation goals have helped 
increas e the transparency and predictability of policy in a number of economies.  
In this spirit, the Federal Open Market Committee (F OMC) has clarif ied the 
Federal Reserve’s  objectives  and policy strategy.  Because of its dual mandate from the 
Congress, which specifies both maximum employment a nd price stability as policy 
objectives, the Federal Reserve could not adopt a numerical infla tion target as its 
exclusive goal.  Nor would it have been appropriate for the FOMC simply to provide a 
fixed objective for some measure of employment or unemployment, in parallel with an inflation objective .  In contrast to inflation, which is determined by monetary policy in 
the longer run, the maximum level of employment that can be sustained over the longer run is determined primarily by nonmonetary factors, such as demographics, the mix of workforce skills, labor market institutions, and advances in te chnology .  Moreover, as 
these factors evolve, the maximum employment level may change over time.  Consequently, it is beyond the power of the central bank to set a longer -run target for 
employment that is immutable or independent of the underlying structur e of the 
economy.
1   
The approach on which the FOMC agreed is described in its  statement of longer -
run goals and policy strategy , issued in January 2012 and reaffirmed in January of this 
                                                 
1 To be clear, although monetary policy has limited influence on the level of employment that can be 
sustained in the longer run, it can be used to help eliminate gaps between the current level of employment 
and its sustainable level --as policy is doing today.   - 4 - 
year.2  The  statement  begins by affirming the FOMC’s commitment to me eting both of 
its statutory objectives.  It then  indicates  that, in the context of the FOMC’s dual 
mandate,  the Committee sees price stability as corresponding to a 2  percent longer -term 
inflation goal .  On the employment side of the mandate, the Committee  makes its best 
assessment of the maximum level of employment at any given time, recognizing that 
such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision.  In practice, the Committee often expresses its employment objective in terms of the longe r-run normal 
rate of unemployment .  Currently , FOMC participants’ estimates of  the longer -run 
normal unemployment rate, as publicly reported in the quarterly Summary of Economic 
Projections, range from  5.2 to 6 percent.
3   
As I noted, explicit objectives are most useful when accompanied by provisional 
plans for achieving them.  Many central banks supplement their announced objectives with published forecasts that, implicitly or explicitly, lay out plans for achieving their goals.  Although the size and diversity of the Federal Reserve’s policymaking committee has made achieving a single consensus forecast difficult, the  quarterly Summary of 
Economic Projections reports each FOMC participant’s view of the most likely future paths of inflation, unemployment, and output growth, conditional on that individual’s view of appropriate monetary policy.  In recent years, this survey has also included 
participants’ projections of the path of future short -term interest rates they see as most 
likely to achieve the Committee’s goals.  In general, the Committee’s two objectives of 
                                                 
2 The January 2013 statement is available on the Board’s website at  
www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf.  
3 The central tendency of the projections for the longer -run normal unemployment rate (which drops the 
three highest and three lowest values submitte d by FOMC participants) was  5.2 to 5.8 percent in 
September.   For the most recent FOMC projections, see 
www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20130918ep.htm  on the Board’s website .    - 5 - 
maximum employment and price stability are complementary.  When they are not, the 
FOMC has stated that it will pursue a balanced approach in the pursuit of its dual mandate, working to ensure that  both inflation and employment are close to their desired 
values in the longer term.   
In short, the Federal Reserve, like many central banks around the world, has made 
significant progress in recent years in clarifying its goals and policy approach, and i n 
providing regular information about the future path of policy that it views as most likely to attain its objectives.  This increased transparency about the framework of policy has aided the public in forming policy expectations, reduced uncertainty, and made policy 
more effective.   
The financial crisis and its aftermath, however, have raised even greater 
challenges for, and demands on, the Federal Reserve’s communication.  We have had to contend with the persistent effects of the seizing -up of the financial system, the collapse 
of housing prices and construction, new financial shocks in Europe and elsewhere, restrictive fiscal policies at all levels of government, and, of course, the enormous blows to output and employment associated with the worst U.S. recession since the Great Depression.  Moreover, for the first time since the FOMC began using the federal funds rate as its policy interest rate, that rate is effectively at zero and thus cannot be lowered meaningfully further.  Consequently, to provide needed support to the economic r ecovery 
and minimize the risk of deflation, the Federal Reserve has had to adopt new policy tools, which bring their own communication challenges.  In the remainder of my talk, I will discuss how the Federal Reserve has used communication to try to further  inform the 
public’s expectations about how the FOMC will employ what are currently its two  - 6 - 
principal policy tools:  its plans regarding its short -term policy interest rate and its large -
scale purchases of securities.  
Forward Guidance  about Policy Interest  Rates  
As the economy weakened over 2008, the FOMC repeatedly cut its target for the 
federal funds rate, its short -term policy rate.  In December of that year, the target for the 
funds rate was reduced to a range of zero to 1/4 percent, and money market ra tes declined 
nearly to zero.  Thus, using the standard means of further easing monetary policy --cutting 
the target interest rate --was no longer possible .  
The so -called zero lower bound on the FOMC’s policy interest rate was not the 
only challenge the Comm ittee faced.  First, the  depth of  the recession, combined with 
ongoing concerns about the functioning of the financial system, raised significant 
uncertainties about both the likely pace of recovery and the effectiveness of monetary policy in supporting gr owth.  The recoveries from most post -World War II U.S. 
recessions had been relatively rapid, with production, unemployment, and other key variables returning to close to normal levels within six to eight quarters.  In such cases, the policy horizon most re levant to financial markets might be the next several quarters.  
In the aftermath of the recent crisis, however, the Committee had to consider the possibility that a highly accommodative policy might be required for a number of years.  
Second, a federal fu nds rate effectively at zero created an important asymmetry 
for policy planning.  On the one hand, i f the economy were to recover rapidly and 
inflation were to increase , monetary policy makers would be able to respond in the normal 
way, by ra ising the feder al funds rate.  But, on the other hand, i f the economy were to 
remain weak or recover only gradually --the case we actually faced --the FOMC  would not  - 7 - 
be able to cut the funds rate further.  Moreover, in the latter case, the economy could face 
an increased r isk of deflation --falling prices.  As the case of Japan illustrates, deflation 
may impede economic growth while being very difficult to escape.  To try to preempt such outcomes, a strong case existed for monetary policy to be more accommodative than sugges ted by  standard policy rules  calibrated to normal times.
4 
So the Committee faced a situation in which more monetary policy 
accommodation was needed, and possibly for quite a long time --yet its basic policy tool, 
the federal funds rate target, had been push ed to its limit.  To put the Committee’s 
problem another way, standard policy rules and a range of other analyses implied that, to achieve the FOMC’s objectives, the target for the federal funds rate should be set well below zero, which, of course, was not  feasible.  Fortunately, as I discussed earlier, the 
degree of accommodation provided by monetary policy depends not just on the current value of the policy rate, but on public expectations of future settings of that rate.  The Committee accordingly realiz ed that it could ease policy further --and reduce uncertainty 
about future policy --by assuring the public and markets that it intended to keep the policy 
rate low for some time, and for a longer period than the public initially expected.   
At first, the Committee employed purely qualitative language to send this 
message:  After the FOMC stated in December 2008 that it would likely be appropriate for the federal funds rate to remain nea r zero for “some time, ” it changed the formulation 
in March 2009 to “an ex tended period.”
5  However, such language did not convey very 
precisely the Committee’s intentions.  In August 2011, the Committee introduced a specific date into its guidance, stating that conditions would likely warrant keeping the 
                                                 
4 See, for example, Eg gertsson and Woodford (2003) and Reifschneider and Williams (2000).  
5 See Board of Governors (2008, 2009).   - 8 - 
federal funds rate targ et near zero at least through mid -2013.6  This d ate-based guidance  
was more precise than the qualitative language the Committee had been using, and it 
appears to have been effective in communicating the FOMC ’s commitment to a highly 
accommodative policy.  In particular, following the introduction of dates into the FOMC 
statement, interest rates  and s urvey measures of policy expectations moved in way s 
broadly consistent with  the guidance.7  
Although the date -based forward guidance appears to have affected the public’s 
expectations as desired, it did not explain  how future policy would be affected by 
changes in the economic outlook--an important limitation.  Indeed, the date in the guidance was pushed out twice in 2012--first to late 2014 and then to mid- 2015--leaving 
the public unsure about whether and under what circumstances further changes to the guidance might occur.
8  In December of last year, the FOMC addressed this issue by 
tying its fo rward guidance about its policy rate more directly to its economic objectives.9  
Introducing so- called state -contingent guidance, the Committee announced for the first 
time that no increase in the federal funds rate target should be anticipated so long as  
unemployment remain ed above 6- 1/2 percent and inflation and inflation expectations 
remained stable and near target.10  This formulation provided greater clarity about the 
                                                 
6 See Board of Governors (2011) . 
7 Evidence that this is the case has been provided by Campbell, Evans, Fisher, and Justiniano (2012) , 
Swanson and Wi lliams (201 3), Raskin (2013),  and by a recent study of the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
York’s survey of primary dealers (Femia, Friedman, and Sack, 201 3). 
8 See Board of Governors (2012a,  b). 
9 See Board of Governors  (2012c ). 
10 See Board of Governors (2012c) .  Specifically , the guidance says that the Committee  anticipates that its 
0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the 
unemployment rate remains above 6 -1/2 percent, inflat ion between one and two years ahead is projected to 
be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer -run goal, and longer -term 
inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.   The FOMC asserted in its statement that it viewed the 
new thresholds to be consistent with the earlier, date- based guidance.  Femia, Friedman, and Sack (2013) 
present evidence that respondents to the survey of primary dealers largely shared this assessment.   - 9 - 
factors influencing the Committee’s thinking about future policy and how that thinking  
might change as the outlook changed.11   
As my colleagues and I have frequently emphasized, the conditions stated in this 
guidance are thresholds , not trigge rs.  Crossing one of the thresholds will not 
automatically give rise to an increase in the federal funds rate target; instead, it will signal 
only that it is appropriate for the C ommittee to begin considering whether an increase in 
the target is warranted.  This threshold formulation helps explain why the Committee was willing to express the guidance be aring on the labor market in terms of the 
unemployment rate alone, instead of following its usual practice of considering a broad range of labor market indicators.  In the judgment of the Committee, the unemployment rate-- which, despite some drawbacks in t his regard, is probably the best single summary 
indicator of the state of the labor market --is sufficient for defining the threshold given by 
the guidance.  However, after the unemployment threshold is crossed, many other 
indicators become relevant to a co mprehensive judgment of the health of the labor 
market, including such measures as payroll employment, labor force participation, and the rates of hiring and separation.  In particular, even after unemployment drops below 6-1/2 percent, and so long as infl ation remains well behaved, the Committee can be patient 
in seeking assurance that the labor market is sufficiently strong before considering any increase in its target for the federal funds rate.  
                                                 
11 An advantage of the state -contingent form ulation is that it increases the tendency of financial market 
conditions to act as an automatic stabilizer for the economy.  For example, bad news about the labor 
market, which tends to lengthen the amount of time the public expects to be required for the unemployment 
rate to reach the threshold, should likewise increase the length of time that the public expects policy to remain highly accommodative.  In response to this shift in policy expectations, interest rates should fall and 
asset prices should rise,  thus easing financial conditions and helping to offset the adverse change to the 
outlook.   - 10 - 
Large -Scale Asset Purchases  and Related Communication  
Becau se of the severity of the recession and  the disruptions in financial markets, 
and because short -term interest rates were near the zero lower bound, it became clear 
early on that more monetary accommodation would be needed than could be provided 
through the  management of short -term rates alone, even with guidance that those rates 
would be kept low well into the future.  Accordingly, at about the same time that the FOMC reduced its target for the federal funds rate close to zero, it began supplementing its ra te policies and forward rate guidance with large -scale asset purchases  (LSAPs) --
specifically, open market purchases of longer -term U.S. Treasury securities and securities 
issued by the government -sponsored enterprises, primarily mortgage -backed securities 
(MBS).  
Both LSAPs and forward guidance for the federal funds rate support the economy 
by putting  downward pressure on longer -term interest rates , but they affect longer -term 
rates through somewhat different channels .  To understand the difference, it is us eful to 
decompose longer -term interest rates into two components :  One reflect s the expected 
path of short -term interest rates, and the other is called a term premium.  Th e term  
premium is the extra return  that investors require  to be willing to hold  a lon ger-term 
security to maturity  compared with the expected yield from rolling over  short -term 
securitie s for the same period.   
As I have noted, f orward rate guidance affects longer -term interest rates primarily 
by influencing investors’ expectations  of future short -term interest rates.  LSAPs , in 
contrast, most directly affect term premiums .  As the Federal Reserve buys a larger share 
of the outstanding stock of longer -term securities, the quantity of these securities  - 11 - 
available for private- sector por tfolios declines.  As the securities purchased by the Fed 
become scarcer, they should become more valuable.  Consequently, their yields should 
fall as investors demand a smaller term premium for holding them.  This argument depends importantly on the assum ption that the longer -term Treasury and MBS securities 
that the Fed buys are not perfectly substitutable with other types of assets, an assumption that seems well supported in practice.
12 
As both forward rate guidance and LSAPs affect longer -term interest r ates, the 
use of these tools allows monetary policy to be effective even when short -term interest 
rates are close to zero.  However, the Committee does not view these two tools as entirely equivalent.  One reason is that we have much less experience with p olicies designed to 
operate on term premiums, as LSAPs do.  As a result, though a strong majority of FOMC members believes that both the forward rate guidance and the LSAPs are helping to support the recovery, we are somewhat less certain about the magnitu des of the effects on 
financial conditions and the economy of changes in the pace of purchases or in the accumulated stock of assets on the Fed’s balance sheet.  Moreover, economists do not have as good an understanding as we would like of the factors dete rmining term 
premiums; indeed, as we saw earlier this year, hard -to-predict shifts in term premiums 
can be a source of  significant volatility in interest rates and financial conditions.  LSAPs 
have other drawbacks not associated with forward rate guidance,  including the risk of  
impairing the  functioning of securities markets and the extra complexities for the Fed of 
operating with  a much larger balance sheet, although I see both of these issues as 
                                                 
12 I discussed this effect more fully in Bernanke (2012) .  As I noted then , both Milton Friedman (2000) and 
James Tobin (1965, 1969) made this argument.  LSAPs may af fect financial conditions through other 
channels as well; see Bernanke (2012) for a more complete discussion.  One such channel is a “signaling 
channel,” which works to the extent that the direct action of buying securities increases the credibility of 
communication tools like forward rate guidance (Posen, 2012).   - 12 - 
manageable.13  In deciding to employ LSAPs, the FOMC has acco rdingly remained 
attentive to the possible costs and risks as well as to the efficacy of this less familiar tool, 
a point the Committee has regularly noted in its post -meeting statements.  Of course, 
elevated unemployment, below -target inflation, lingering  economic fragility, and the 
harmful effects of long -term unemployment on our society and economic potential also 
pose significant costs and risks, and the Committee has, thus far, judged that the balance favors the use of LSAPs.  
Between November 2008 and June 2012, the FOMC announced or extended a 
series of asset purchase programs, in each case specifying the expected quantities of assets to be acquired under the program.  Like the use of date -based forward guidance, 
announcing a program of predetermined size and duration has advantages and disadvantages.  On the one hand, a fixed program size is straightforward to communicate; on the other hand, a program of fixed size cannot so easily adapt to changes in the 
economic outlook and the consequent changes in the need for policy accommodation.  In announcing its fixed- size programs, the FOMC did state a general willingness to do more 
if needed --and, indeed, it has followed through on that promise --but such statements left 
                                                 
13 An additional concern that some have raised about the Federal Reserve’s expanded balance sheet is the 
possibility that financial conditions could evolve in a way that significantly reduces the Fe d’s net interest 
income on its portfolio for a time, which in turn could lead to a period during which the Fed is not remitting 
income to the Treasury; see Carpenter and others (2013) for an analysis.  Such a situation, though unlikely, could have reputati onal costs and possibly increase risks to the Federal Reserve’s independence.  Although 
these costs must be taken into account, careful analysis suggests that, in fact, LSAPs almost certainly will result in improved government finances:  First, even if a p eriod of no payments to the Treasury occurs, it is 
highly likely that the payments over the period of unconventional monetary policy will be significantly 
higher than they would have been without LSAPs; indeed, since 2009, the Fed has remitted more than $3 50 
billion to the Treasury, about the same total as it remitted during the 18 years prior to the crisis (1990 -2007 
inclusive).  Second, a complete accounting of the fiscal effects of LSAPs should take into account the 
beneficial effects of a stronger econo my on tax receipts, interest payments, and government spending; the 
reduction in the budget deficit from these sources will certainly outweigh the effects on the deficit of any 
changes in the pace of Fed payments.  Finally, while fiscal effects are important, the full effect of the 
FOMC’s policies also includes important additional benefits of increased economic growth and 
employment and of greater price stability.   - 13 - 
considerable uncertainty regarding the conditions that might warrant changes in an 
existing program or the introduction of a new one.  
In a step roughly analogous to the shift from date -based guidance to the 
contingent, thresholds -based guidance now in use for the federal funds rate target, in 
September 2012 the FOMC announced a program of asset purchases in which the total 
size of the purchase program would not be fixed in advance but instead would be linked to the Committee’s economic objectives.  In particular, the Committee initiated purcha ses 
of agency MBS at the rate of $40 billion per month and stated its intention to continue purchases until  the outlook for the labor market improved substantially in a context of 
price stability.
14  In December 2012, when a program to extend the maturity of the Fed’s 
portfolio of Treasury securities came to an end, the FOMC added purchases of $45 billion per month in longer -term Treasury securities to the new program, bringing the 
monthly purchase rate to $85 billion, where it remains today.   
As I noted, t he Committee set a criterion of substantial improvement in the 
outlook for the labor market as the condition for ending the new purchase program.  T he 
Committee also signaled its expectation that it would  end the purchases and return to an 
emphasis on rate s policy and f orward  guidance before it had fully attained its dual 
mandate objectives , stating that “the Committee expects that a highly accommodative 
stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase progr am ends and the economic recovery strengthens.”
15  The reason for this 
                                                 
14 This criterion was expressed in slightly different ways in the FOMC statements between Sep tember 2012 
and January 2013.  S ince March 2013 , the statement has included the sentence, “The Committee will 
continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage -backed securities, and employ its other policy 
tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a  context of price 
stability.”   FOMC statements are available at www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.  
15 See Board of Governors ( 2012c).   - 14 - 
sequencing choice, again, was the greater uncertainty about the costs and efficacy of 
LSAPs, relative to the more familiar tool of managing the current short- term interest rate 
and, through forward guidance, expectations of future short -term interest rates.  
Moreover, to the extent that the use of LSAPs engenders additional costs and risks, one might expect th e tradeoff between the efficacy and costs of this tool to become less 
favora ble as the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet  expands . 
Having seen progress in the labor market since the beginning of the latest asset 
purchase program in September 2012, the Committee agreed in June of this year to provide more -comprehensive guidance about the criteria that would inform future 
decisions about the program.  Consequently, in my press conference following the June FOMC meeting, I presented a framework linking the program more explicitly to the evolution of the FOMC’s economic outlook.  In parti cular, I noted the Committee’s 
expectation at the time that improvements in the job market would continue, supported by 
a moderate pickup in growth that would support those gains.  The Committee additionally expected that inflation would be moving back tow ard its 2  percent objective over time.  If 
the incoming data were broadly consistent with that outlook, the Committee would likely begin measured reductions in the pace of asset purchases later in 2013.  If the economy evolved as anticipated, the end of purchases would occur around midyear 2014.  I also emphasized that the path of purchases would depend on incoming data and could be slower or faster than envisioned in the modal scenario--indeed, I noted that the pace of purchases could be increased for a ti me, if warranted.  
The framework I discussed in June implied that substantial additional asset 
purchases over the subsequent quarters were likely, with even more purchases possible if  - 15 - 
economic developments proved disappointing.  However, following the June meeting and 
press conference, market yields moved sharply higher.  For example, between the FOMC meetings of June and September,  the 10- year Treasury yield  rose about 3/4 percentage 
point and rates on MBS increased by a similar amount. 
Financial market mov ements are often difficult to account for, even after the fact, 
but three main reasons seem to explain the r ise in interest rates  over the summer.  First, 
improvements in the economic outlook warranted somewhat higher yields --a natural and 
healthy developm ent.  Second, some of the rise in rates reportedly reflected an unwinding 
of levered positions --positions that appear to have been premised on an essentially 
indefinite continuation of asset purchases --together with some knock- on liquidations of 
other posi tions in response to investor losses and the rise in volatility.  Although it 
brought with it some tightening of financial conditions, this unwinding  and the associated 
rise in term premiums  may have had the benefit of reducing future risks to financial 
stability and, in particular, of lowering the p robability  of an even  sharper market 
correction  at some later point.  Third,  market participants may have taken the 
communication in June as indicating a general lessening of the Committee’s commitment to mainta in a highly accommodative stance of policy in pursuit of its objectives.  In 
particular, it appeared that the FOMC’s forward guidance for the federal funds rate had become less effective after June, with market participants pulling forward the time at whic h they expected the Committee to start raising rates, in a manner inconsistent with 
the guidance.
16   
                                                 
16 For example, the Eurodollar futures rate for mid -2015 rose about 40 basis points in the few days 
following the June FOMC meeting, far more than could be explained by revisions to the economic outlook.    - 16 - 
To the extent that this third factor --a perceived reduction in the Fed’s commitment 
to meeting its objectives --contributed to the increase in yields, it wa s neither welcome nor 
warranted, in the judgment of the FOMC.  This change in expectations did not 
correspond to any actual lessening in the FOMC’s commitment or intention to provide the high degree of monetary accommodation needed to meet its objectives , as Committee 
participants emphasized in subsequent communications . 
At its September 2013 m eeting, the FOMC applied the framework communicated 
in June.  T he Committee’s decision at that meeting to maintain the pace of asset 
purchases was appropriate and ful ly consistent with the earlier guidance.  The Committee 
was looking for evidence that job market gains would continue, supported by a pickup in growth.  As it happened, the implications for the outlook of the evidence reviewed at the September meeting were mixed at best, while the ongoing fiscal debates posed additional 
risks.  The Committee accordingly elected to await further evidence supporting its 
expectation of continued improvement in the labor market.
17  Although the FOMC’s 
decision came as a surprise to some market participants, it appears to have strengthened 
the credibility of the Committee’s forward rate guidance; in particular, following the 
decision, longer -term rates fell and expectations of short -term rates derived from 
financial market prices showed, and continue to show, a pattern more consistent with the guidance.  
In coming meetings, in evaluating the outlook for the labor market, we will 
continue to consider both the cumulative progress since September 2012 and the prospect for continued gai ns.  We have seen meaningful improvement in the labor market since 
the latest asset purchase program was announced in September 2012.  At the time, the 
                                                 
17 See Board of Governors (2013a, b).   - 17 - 
latest reading on the unemployment rate was 8.1 percent, and both we and most private -
sector economists were projecting only slow reductions in unemployment in the coming 
quarters.  Recent reports on payroll employment had also been somewhat disappointing.  However, since the program was announced, the unemployment rate has fallen 0.8 percentage point, and a bout 2.6 million payroll jobs have been added.  Looking forward, 
we will of course continue to monitor the incoming data.  As reflected in the latest Summary of Economic Projections and the October FOMC statement, the FOMC still expects that labor market conditions will continue to improve and that inflation will move toward the 2 percent objective over the medium term.  If these views are supported by incoming information, the FOMC will likely begin to moderate the pace of purchases.  However, asset purcha ses are not on a preset course, and the Committee’s decisions 
about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee’s economic outlook.  As before, the Committee will also continue to take into account its assessment of the likely 
efficacy and costs of the program.  
When, ultimately, asset purchases do slow, it will likely be because the economy 
has progressed sufficiently for the Committee to rely more heavily on its rate policies, the associated forward guidance, and its substantial continued holdings of securities to maintain progress toward maximum employment and to achieve price stability.
18  In 
particular, the target for the federal funds rate is likely to remain near zero for a considerable time after the asset purchases end, perhaps well after the unemployment 
                                                 
18 By the logic described earlier, the Fed’s maintenance of a large balance sheet ( by reinvesting principal 
paydowns and r olling over  maturing securities) should continue to put downward pressure on term 
premiums and longer -term interest rates, even after purchases end.  Also, as I noted at my June press 
conference, a strong majority of the Committee now expects that there will be no sales of agency MBS 
during the process of normalizing monetary policy, although in the longer run limited sales could be used 
to reduce or eliminate residual MBS holdings.   See Board of Governors (2013c).   - 18 - 
threshold is crossed and at least until the preponderance of the data support s the 
beginning of the removal of policy accommodation.  
Conclusion  
I began my time as Chairman with the goal of increasing the transparency of the 
Federal Reserve, and of monetary policy in particular.  In response to a financial crisis 
and a deep recession, the Fed’s monetary policy communications have proved far more important and have evolved in different ways than I would have envisioned eight years ago.   
The eco nomy has made significant progress since the  depths  of the recession .  
However, we are still far from where we would like to be, and, consequently, it may be some time before monetary policy returns to more normal settings.  I agree with the sentiment, exp ressed by my colleague Janet Yellen at her testimony last week, that the 
surest path to a more normal approach to monetary policy is to do all we can today to 
promote a more robust recovery.
19  The FOMC remains committed to  maintaining highly 
accommodative policies for as long as they are needed .  Communication about policy is 
likely to remain a central element of the Federal Reserve’s  efforts to achieve its policy 
goals.

Thank you for inviting me  here to celebrate this important milestone .  Today  is a 
special day  for all of us , since the founding of the Riksbank 350 years ago marked the 
beginning of central banking .1  As we meet to discuss the challenges and opportunities 
the future may hold, it is worth pausing to note that the three and a half centuries since 
the Riksbank’s founding have seen economic growth and dynamism the breadth and 
duration of which ha ve been unprecedented in world history.  The Swedish innovation we 
celebrate today, I believe, is a vital part of the financial founda tions that support the 
continuation of rising prosperity.   
In my comments today, I will explore the road ahead for public transparency and 
accountability of central banks  in a time of intense scrutiny and declining trust in public 
institutions  in many pla ces around the world.  As you know, the importance of 
transparency and accountability to monetary policymaking was recognized and became 
firmly entrenched in practice over the past few decades.  The Riksbank has been a leader 
in this transparency revolution.  Today I will focus on the less -often emphasized but 
critically important role transparency and accountability play in regulatory and financial 
stability polic ies.  
To preview my conclusions, public transparency and accountability around both 
financial stability and monetary policy have become all the more important in light of the 
extraordinary actions taken by central banks in response to the Global Financial Crisis.  
Financial stability policymaking has evolved from managing individual crise s as they 
arise to establishing a policy framework that emphasizes prevention.  This framework 
now includes measures to increase the resiliency of the financial system ; enhanced 
                                                 
1 See Bordo (2007).   - 2 - 
monitoring  of financial institutions and of building risks to the system; and measures, 
such as resolution planning, that  require  firms to take steps today to better prepare for 
future episodes of stress.  These innovations have placed special demands on 
transparency and accountability, and we have worked hard to explain them to the  public.  
The framework is still evolving, and we will need to be open to making changes and to 
new ways to enhance transparency and accountability .   
Government, C entral B anking, and Independence  
This is a challenging moment for central banking.  Opinion polls show that trust 
in government and public institutions is at historic lows.2  In this environment, central 
banks cannot take our measure of independence for granted.   
For monetary policy, the case for central bank independence rests on the 
demonstrat ed benefits of insulating monetary policy decisions from shorter -term political 
considerations.  But for a quarter century, inflation has been low and inflation 
expectations anchored .  We must not forget the lessons of the past, when a lack of central 
bank independence led to episodes of runaway inflation and subsequent economic 
contractions . 
As for financial stability, the crisis and the severe recession that followed revealed 
serious flaws at many private and public institutions, including  shortcomings in  
supervision and regulation.  The crisis and its aftermath led central banks to take 
extraordinary actions, actions that challenged the ingenuity of experts in the field and 
were understandably difficult to explain and justify to a skeptical public .  While  these 
actions were authorized by law and on the whole necessary to avert the complete collapse 
                                                 
2 For example, see Pew Research Center ( 2017).   - 3 - 
of the financial system’s ability to service households and businesses, they may have also 
contributed to the erosion of public trust. 
Central banks are assigne d narrow but important mandates.  For monetary policy, 
the Fed’s mandate is to keep inflation low and stable and to achieve maximum 
employment.  For financial sector supervision and regulation, part of our mandate is to 
foster the safety and soundness of i ndividual institutions.  In addition, we have a 
responsibility , shared with other government agencies, to promote financial stability.  I 
view this responsibility as being highly complementary to other aspects of our mission:  
Financial stability promotes sustainable economic growth, and a stable, well -functioning 
financial system is an effective transmission channel for monetary policy.  Indeed, t here 
can be no macroeconomic stability without financial stability.  
Within our  narrow mandates, to safeguard against political interference, central 
banks are afforded instrument independence --that is, we are given considerable freedom 
to choose the means to  achieve legislatively -assigned goals.  While the focus is often on 
monetary policy independence, research suggests that a degree of independence in 
regulatory and financial stability matters  improves the stability of the banking system and 
leads to better outcomes .3  For this reason, governments in many countries , including the 
United States, have  granted some institutional and budgetary independence to their 
financial regulators.  
                                                 
3 Technical implementation and oversight are two areas where instrument independence may be especially 
helpful.  See Hogue, Labonte, and Webel (2017) and the references therein.  Also, the need for some 
regulatory independence is not exclusive to the central bank; see Bernanke (2017) for a discussion.   - 4 - 
Financial S tability, T ransparency and A ccountability  
In a democratic system, any degree of independence brings with it the obligation 
to provide appropriate transparency .  In turn, t ransparency provides an essential basis for  
accountability  and democratic legitimacy by enabling  effective legislative oversight and 
keeping the public  informed.4  Of course, central banks also need to stick closely to our 
mandates; the case f or independence weakens to the extent that central banks stray into 
issues that the legislature has not assigned to us.5 
There is also an important policy effectiveness argument in favor of transparency.  
In the financial stability arena, there is no bette r example of this than the role that the first 
round of stress tests played during the crisis in restoring confidence in the U.S. banking 
system.6  So in the financial stability realm, the case for enhanced transparency is not just 
about being accountable;  it is also about providing credible information that can help 
restore and sustain public confidence in the financial system.  
The post -crisis regulatory system recognizes the importance of enhanced 
transparency, both about financial institutions themselves and about the processes and 
expectations of regulators and supervisors.  Before the crisis, supervision focused on the 
safety  and soundness of individual institutions and was insufficiently attentive to risk in 
the financial system as a whole.   Supervisory judgments about firms were shared with the 
public only in rare and exceptional circumstances.  Financial stability tools wer e 
deployed after the fact, to address specific events that emerged to threaten stability.  It is 
an understatement to say that this approach proved  inadequate in the crisis.

The p ost-crisis  regime has  shifted to implementing preventive policies well in 
advance of any crisis .7  Newly established ex ante policies include building the resilience 
of institutions  by requiring more and higher -quality capital and liquidity buffers; a regime 
of stress tests undertaken by supervisors; and resolution planning , which requires firms to 
analyze their own potential for distress or failure and create a plan to be used in the event 
of bankruptcy.  These post -crisis policies have benefitted from public solicitation of 
feedback and in many cases from consideration in open mee tings of the Board of 
Governors.   
Transparency and incorporation of public feedback in these areas have produce d 
more effective supervision and regulation.  For example, transparent and clearly 
communicated policies make it easier for regulated entities to know what  is expected of 
them and how best to comply .  Of course, as with any large -scale, complex undertaking , 
the standards adopted over the past decade can undoubtedly be  improve d.  At the Fed , we 
are committed to transparency as we assess the efficacy and efficiency of post -crisis 
reforms.   
In a sense, stress testing is itself a step  forward in transparency.  Pre -crisis, 
supervisors’ views of the risks facing our most systemically important firms --and the 
firms’ ability to understand and survive these risks --were shrouded in secrecy.  Post -
crisis, as part of our stress -testing regime, these  supervisory views and expectations are 
transparent.  We expect that these firms will have capital, liquidity, an d risk -management 
capabilities that are adequate for the firms not only to survive, but to continue to perform 
their key functions even in the event of truly severe stress, akin to the global financial

crisis.  We make a great deal of information regarding  the stress tests public, including 
the scenarios we use, portfolio- level projected losses for participating firms, and, of 
course, the results.  We have also proposed for public comment a range of ways to further 
enhance the transparency of the supervisor y stress tests.  This detailed disclosure 
provides the public with a wealth of information on how these institutions  would perform 
under severe stress .  And this transparency  both enhances public confidence and holds 
banking regulators accountable for thei r judgments.   
At the Federal Reserve we use a variety of additional means to enhance public 
understanding of our supervisory and financial  stability efforts  and judgments .  The 
Board’s Vice Chairman for Supervision testifies before the Congress twice a ye ar.  The  
Board staff’s assessment of financial stability is discussed four times a year at Federal 
Open Market Committee meetings , and these discussions are summarized in the 
meeting’s published minutes.  And, since 2013, t he semiannual Monetary Policy Rep ort 
to the Congress has contained a review of financial stability conditions .  
The Way F orward  
The post -crisis framework remains novel and unfamiliar.  Some of these new 
policies, such as stress testing and resolution planning, are inherently complex and 
challenging for all involved.  As a result, t ransparency and accountability around 
financial stability tools present particular challenge s.  We will continue to strive to find 
better ways to enhance transparency around our approach to preserving financial stability.  
Efforts to engage with the public --including consumer groups, academics, and the 
financial sector --are likely to lead to improved policies.  Moreover, ongoing dialogue will 
work to enhance public  trust, as well as our ability to adapt to new th reats as they emerge.    - 7 - 
There is every reason to expect that technology and communications will continue 
to rapidly evolve, and to affect the financial system and financial stability in ways that we 
cannot fully anticipate.  While future innovations may we ll improve the delivery of 
financial services and make the system stronger, they may also contain the seeds of 
potential future systemic vulnerabilities.  We will need to keep up with the pace of 
innovation, which will doubtless require changes to our appr oach to financial stability .  
As we consider such changes, i t will remain critically important to provide transparency 
and accountability .  By doing so, we strengthen the foundation of democratic legitimacy 
that enables central banks to serve the needs of our citizens, in the long and proud 
tradition of the Riksbank.

Economic Measurement 
  
Remarks by

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System

to the 
 
32nd General Conference of the

I appreciate the opportunity to speak at a conference w ith the important theme of 
economic measurement.  In many spheres of human endeavor, from science to business 
to education to economic policy, good decisions depend on good measurement.  More subtly, what we decide to measure, or are able to measure, has important effects on the 
choices we make, since it is natural to focu s on those objectives for which we can best 
estimate and document the effects of our decisi ons.  One great pioneer in this subject 
area, of course, is Simon Kuznets, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1971 for his work 
on economic measurement, including the national income accounts.  Over the years many economists have built on his work to furthe r improve our ability to quantify aspects of 
economic activity and thus to improve econom ic policymaking and our understanding of 
how the economy works.  The remarkably broa d and ambitious research program of this 
conference and the impressive expertise that has been assembled illu strate the continued 
vitality of this field.  Evolving technologies that allow economists to gather new types of 
data and to manipulate millions of data point s are just one factor among several that are 
likely to transform the field in coming years. 
As we think about new directions for economic measurement, we might start by 
reminding ourselves of the purpose of economi cs.  Textbooks describe economics as the 
study of the allocation of scarce resources.  Th at definition may indeed be the “what,” but 
it certainly is not the “why.”  The ultimate  purpose of economics, of course, is to 
understand and promote the enhancement of well-being.  Economic measurement accordingly must encompass measures of well-being and its determinants. 
In the tradition of national income accounting, economic policymakers have 
typically focused on variables such as inco me, wealth, and consumption.  The Federal - 2 - 
 
 
 Reserve has a statutory mandate to foster  maximum employment and price stability, 
which motivates our extensive efforts to m onitor and forecast measures of employment 
and inflation.  Substantial re search and the development of data collection infrastructures 
have, over the years, greatly enhanced our abi lity to receive timely and accurate measures 
of those variables.  Aggregate measures, such as gross domestic product and personal 
consumption expenditures, are useful for monitoring people’s ability to meet basic 
material needs and for tracking cyclical and secular changes in the economy as a whole.  Indeed, the experience of the recent financial crisis and the ensuing recession was strongly reflected in nearly all of these aggregate meas ures, indicating the severe 
economic stress felt by millions of people and hundreds of communities across the country.  
But, as many of you will discuss this week, aggregate statistics can sometimes 
mask important information.  For example, even though some key aggregate 
metrics--including consumer spending, dispos able income, household net worth, and debt 
service payments--have moved in the direc tion of recovery, it is clear that many 
individuals and households cont inue to struggle with diffi cult economic and financial 
conditions.  Exclusive attenti on to aggregate numbers is lik ely to paint an incomplete 
picture of what many individuals are experi encing.  One implication is that we should 
increase the attention paid to  microeconomic data, which bett er capture the diversity of 
experience across households and firms.  Anot her implication, however, is that we should 
seek better and more-direct measurements of economic well-being, the ultimate objective 
of our policy decisions.   - 3 - 
 
 
 Although the field is still young, there have been interesting developments in the 
measurement of economic well-being.  In a commencement address two years ago titled 
“The Economics of Happiness,” I spoke a bout the concepts of happiness and life 
satisfaction from the perspective of econom ics and other social science research.1  
Following the growing literature, I define “ha ppiness” as a short-term  state of awareness 
that depends on a person’s perceptions of one’s immediate reality, as well as on 
immediate external circumstances and outcomes.   By “life satisfaction” I mean a longer-
term state of contentment and well-being th at results from a person’s experiences over 
time.  Surveys and experimental studies have made progress in identifying the determinants of happiness and life satisfacti on.  Interestingly, income and wealth do 
contribute to self-reported ha ppiness, but the relationship is  more complex and context-
dependent than standard u tility theory would suggest.
2  Other important contributors to 
individuals’ life satisfaction ar e a strong sense of support from  belonging to a family or 
core group and a broader community, a sense of  control over one’s life, a feeling of 
confidence or optimism about the future, and an ability to adapt to changing 
circumstances.  Indeed, an interesting finding in the literature is that the overwhelming 
majority of people in the United States and in many other countries  report being very 
happy or pretty happy on a daily basis--a findi ng that researchers link to people’s intrinsic 
abilities to adapt and find satisfaction in th eir lives even in very difficult circumstances.3

2 Canonical models of economic decisionmaking presume individual maximization of “utility,” or well-
being.  They tend to focus on the consumption of goods or services and assume that more consumption is 
preferred to less.  For example, see Andrew Mas-Colell, Michael D. Whinston, and Jerry R Green (1995), 
Microeconomic Theory  (New York:  Oxford University Press).

mid-1970s to the mid-1990s, see Rafael Di Tella and Robert MacCulloch (2008), “Gross National - 4 - 
 
 
 This line of research has generated alte rnative measures of well-being that are 
frequently survey-based and incorporate el ements such as psychological wellness, the 
level of education, physical he alth and safety, community vi tality and the strength of 
family and social ties, and tim e spent in leisure ac tivities.  These measures have begun to 
inform official statistics and have starte d to be discussed in policy debates.  An 
interesting and unique case is the Kingdom of Bhutan, which abandoned tracking gross 
national product in 1972 in favor of its  Gross National Happiness index based on a 
survey that incorporates thes e types of indicators.  Taking the measurement of well-being 
in a cross-country framework, the Orga nisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD), as part of its OECD Better Life Ini tiative, has created a “better 
life index” that allows a side-by-side co mparison of countries according to various 
quality-of-life indicators that could, at le ast in principle, be followed over time.4  Other 
somewhat-more-conventional economic indicators  that bear on quality of life, and that 
accordingly might be developed and followed in more detail, include changes in the 
distribution of income, wealth, or consumption; the degree of  upward mobility in material 
measures of well-being; i ndications of job security and confidence about future 
employment prospects; and households’ liquidi ty buffers or other measures of their 
ability to absorb financial shoc ks.  All of these indicators could be useful in measuring 
economic progress or setbacks as well as in explaining economic decisionmaking or 
projecting future economic outcomes.

 Continued work on the measurement of ec onomic well-being will likely lead to 
greater recognition by economists of the cont ributions of psychology--an area that has 
been explored by pioneers like 2002 Nobel laur eate Daniel Kahneman.  One topic on the 
frontier of economics and psychology is th e neurological basis of human decisions, 
including decisionmaking under risk and uncer tainty, intertemporal choice, and social 
decisionmaking.5  Researchers are investigating beha vioral tendencies in a variety of 
circumstances--for instance, by examining human responses to perceived inequality, 
losses, risk, and uncertainty; the need for au tonomy; and the importance for well-being of 
social ties and community.  For example,  brain imaging research has documented 
differences in the brain regions that light up in response to losse s and gains--a clear 
physical manifestation of the “loss aversion” documented in the earlier behavioral studies 
in economics and psychology.6  Evolutionary psychologi sts suggest that humans 
experienced evolutionary benef its from brain developments that included aversion to loss 
and risk, and from instincts for cooperati on that helped strengthen communities.   
Measurement of well-being is an important  direction, but just one of many new 
directions for economic measurement being expl ored in the field generally and at this 
conference in particular.  I am glad to s ee scholars and practitioners continuing to push 
the frontiers of economic measurement with a broad perspective and with open minds.

mistake to theorize before one has data.”7  As I said at the beginning, good economic

Good afternoon.  It is a pleasure to be with you today. 
Together, over the past year, we have been making our way through a very 
difficult time.  We are not out of the woods yet, but I am glad to say that we are now making real progress.  While some countries are still suffering terribly in the grip of 
COVID- 19, the economic outlook here in the United States has clearly brightened.  
Vaccination levels are rising.  Fiscal and monetary policy are providing strong support.  The economy is reopening, bringing stronger economic activity and job creation.   
That is th e high -level perspective—let’s call it the 30,000 foot view —and from 
that vantage point, we see improvement.  But we should also take a look at what is happening at street level.  Lives and livelihoods have been affected in ways that vary from person to pe rson, family to family, and community to community.  The economic 
downturn has not fallen evenly on all Americans, and those least able to bear the burden 
have been the hardest hit. 
The pain is all the greater in light of the gains we had seen in the years prior to  the 
pandemic.  COVID swept in as the United States was experiencing the longest expansion 
on record.  Unemployment was at 50- year lows, and inflation remained under control.  
Wages were moving up, particularly for the lowest -paid workers.  Long- standing racial 
disparities in unemployment were narrowing, and many who had struggled for years were finding jobs.   It was not until the later years of that expansion that its benefits had started 
to reach those on the margins.  During our  Fed Listens even ts, we met with people around 
the country and heard repeatedly about the life -changing gains of the strong labor market, 
particularly at the lower end of the income spectrum.  Just a few months later, those  - 2 - 
stories changed to ones of job losses, overextended support services, and businesses built 
over generations closing their doors for good.  
While the recovery is gathering strength, it has been slower for those in lower-
paid jobs:  Almost 20 percent of work ers who were in the lowest earnings quartile in 
February of 2020 were not employed a year later, compared to 6 percent for workers in the highest quartile.
1  
The Fed’s latest Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking— or 
SHED report —which will be published later  this month, will show that , for prime -age 
adults without a bachelor’s degree, 20 percent saw layoffs in 2020 versus 12 percent for college- educated workers.  And more than 20 percent of Black and Hispanic prime -age 
workers were laid off compa red to 14 percent of white workers over the same period.   
Small businesses have also faced immense difficulties.   Fed research found that 
80 percent of those surveyed reported a decline in revenue, with two- thirds of those 
businesses experiencing losses o f at least 25  percent.
2  A recent Federal Reserve special 
report looked specifically at the impact on businesses owned by people of color, who  
reported greater challenges.  For example, 67 percent of both Asian-  and Black -owned 
firms and 63 percent of His panic -owned firms had to reduce their operations compared to 
54 percent for their white counterparts.3

Our upcoming SHED report notes that 22 percent of parents were either not 
working or working less because of disruptions to childcare or in- person schooling.  
Black and Hispanic mothers —36 percent and 30 percent, respectively —were 
disproportionately affected.  In a similar vein, labor force participation declined around 
4 percentage points for Black and Hispanic women compared to 1.6 percentage points for  
white women and about 2 percentage points for men overall.4  The Fed is focused on 
these long- standing disparities because they weigh on the productive capacity of our 
economy.  We will only reach our full potential when everyone can contribute to, and 
share in, the benefits of prosperity.  
Achieving broadly shared prosperity will take action from across society, from 
fiscal and other government policy to private -sector initiatives to the work everyone here 
does.  The Fed can contribute as well.  Using our monetary policy tools, the Fed promotes maximum employment and price stability —two foundations of a strong, stable 
economy that can improve economic outcomes for all Americans.  We view maximum employment as a bro ad and inclusive goal.  Those who have historically been left behind 
stand the best chance of prospering in a strong economy with plentiful job opportunities.  Our recent history highlights both the benefits of a strong economy and the severe costs 
of a we ak one.   
Supervisory tools also have a role to play.  As part of our policy responsibilities, 
the Board of Governors enforces both the Fair Housing Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the federal fair lending laws that prohibit discrimination in len ding.  
Violations of the fair lending laws, along with other illegal credit practices, are taken into

account during bank evaluations under the Community Reinvestment Act  (CRA) .  We 
see our robust supervisory approach as critical to addressing racial discr imination, which 
can limit consumers’ ability to improve their economic circumstances, including through 
access to homeownership and education.  
The Fed’s community development function plays a role as well, studying what 
works, convening stakeholders on bo th the national and D istrict level, and helping 
financial institutions find opportunities to invest and expand credit opportunities in low- 
and moderate -income  communities.  
The economic landscape has changed, and efforts to provide access and credit to 
communities must change with it.   Last year, the Fed issued a proposal for a 
strengthened, modernized CRA framework , with the objective of building  broad support 
among both external stakeholders and participating agencies.  Our goal is to strengthen 
the core purpose of meeting the credit needs of low - and moderate -income communities.  
We especially appreciated NCRC’s  feedback on the proposal. 
We will continue to do our part, and we appreciate the ways our work and that of 
NCRC members have intersected.  Last April, for instance, the Fed expanded the Paycheck P rotection P rogram L iquidity F acility  in order to broaden its reach to include 
some nondepository lenders.  That included CDFI  (community development financial 
institution ) loan funds, which many of the people here represent.  Your work provided 
small businesses with invaluable technical assistance to help them weather the downturn, and you have helped them get the funds they need to support their businesses.  
NCRC member groups have contributed in so many ways.  You helped workers 
who lost their jobs get retrained.  You supported working parents.  You helped  - 5 - 
homeowners struggling with payments and connected renters to federal assistance 
programs.  You brought more people into the banking system, helped strengthen financial 
literacy and capabilities, and worked to address digital divides in areas of need—partic ularly in rural communities —at a time when connectivity is essential.  
I would like to close by saying thank you.  You have been working hard through 
this crisis, and an enormous amount of work still lies ahead.  But what you do is essential.  
You provide a n invaluable service:   You make people’s lives better.  There is no higher 
calling.  
Thank you. ",2021-05-03,powell

Risk in the Crypto Markets  
  
Remarks by  
 
Christopher J. Waller  
 
Member   
 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  
 
at 
 
SNB- CIF Conference on Cryptoassets and Financial Innovation  
 
Zürich , Switzerland  
       
June 3, 2022Thank you for the chance to be part of this interesting discussion.  It’s a pleasure to speak 
with such a good mix of academic, industry, and official-sector experts about a topic with real 
importance to the future of the financial system.  I know my remarks are coming after a long day, and I plan to keep them short.  My goal tonight is not to weigh in on whether and how crypto-asset markets should be regulated.  Instead, I want to make some observations that I hope will help focus discussion of that question in the right place.  T he main issue in crypto- asset 
regulation isn’t how to p rotect sophisticated crypto- investors; it’s how to protect the rest of us .  
By any measure, the last five years have been a stretch  of incredible growth in crypto-
asset markets.  Every aspect of them has expanded, from protocols and platforms, to instruments 
and intermediaries.  Public awareness and government attention have increased.  Above all, crypto itself has evolved from a limited  set of coins  meant to provide an alternative means of 
payment to decentralized finance , or “DeFi ,” arrangements, meant  to provide alternatives to a 
range of financial products and services.
1  Innovation is happening fast, and many of the people 
and groups represented in this room have found new uses in finance for this technology. 
By law or by practice, many crypto -related  products and activities fall between the cracks 
of traditional legal and regulatory structures , outside the so-called “ regulatory perimeter. ”  In that 
environment, the normal backstops and safety nets of traditional finance do not necessarily or reliably apply.  High volatility is the rule , not the exception; fraud and theft occur regularly, 
often at large scale.  Your whole pot is always on the table ; you take part at your own risk. 
Some DeFi traders understand these dynamics  well .  If they don’t embrace them, they 
still accept them as the natural state for a new, exciting, and still relatively unregulated

marketplace.  And they have a point: Crypto and DeFi may be new, but these kinds of 
freewheeling markets aren’t .  They often emerge —to quote Professor Debora Spar —after:  
 
“a sharp movement along the technological frontier —a moment in time when innovation 
leap[s]  suddenly outward, creating new opportunities for commerce and tremendous 
enthusiasm among aspiring entrepreneurs.  In each c ase…the technological leap also 
create[s]  a political gap.  Innovation, in other words, enable [s] firms to play in some new 
sphere of activity, free from the rules or regulations that might bind them in another, 
more established realm. ”2 
 That was true wi th long -distance ocean trade in the 1400s ; with the spread of railroad 
transportation  in 19
th century America  and the explosive growth of banks to fund it ; with 
“homebrew ” computing in the ’60s and ’70s; and with the internet in the ’90s .  New 
technology —and a lack of clear rules—meant some new fortunes were made, even as others 
were lost.  
There’s a lot to like about these kinds of markets . Entry is often cheap, and exit is often 
swift. C ompetition can be fierce . And inefficiency can be fatal, s o improvements can happen 
quickly.  The ideas, practices, and technologies that survive in these rough waters can eventually disrupt and improve older and calmer markets.  As I’ve said previously in the context of

Technological Frontier  (New York: Harper Business, 2003), 9. 3 
 
stablecoins, t hose positive spillovers can  (under the right circumstances) make everyone better 
off.3 
From the perspective of  many market participants—the ones who survive and thrive in 
this rough and tumble—regulation isn’t just unnece ssary , it’s counterproductive.  It drives up 
costs, creates barriers to entry, and stifles innovation.  From some crypto advocates, I have heard 
this argument as well as  a related one: that these experienced investors know what they’re 
getting into, and that they’re not asking for protection because they believe they don’t need it.  
Given all of that, the argument goes, why should anyone bring regulation into a space that’s not 
asking for it?  
 L et’s focus on crypto- asset users , who are a very different group than just a few years 
ago.  T he Federal Reserve’s most recent Survey of Household Economic Decisionmaking found 
that 12 percent  of adults used or held cryptocurrency in the past year, and more than 90 percent  
of these adults held them for investment purposes rather than  payments.4  The Pew  Research 
Center put the number of users even higher at 16  percent, and other polls as high as 20 percent .5  
Some of these users are seasoned  professional investors, but others, of course, are not—they’re 
attracted to a new and complicated market by curiosity, by stories of newly minted crypto billionaires, or by promises of high and reliable returns on their life savings.

New retail user s, by definition, do not have crypto experience.   They don’t know how to 
independently buy a crypto asset, how to obtain and protect a private key, how to conduct trades 
on a DeFi protocol, or how to write a smart contract.  They need help, and for a price , a range of 
fast-growing exchanges, wallet providers , and other intermediaries are willing to provide it .  But 
while  intermediaries can potentially help monitor and manage risk , they can’t eliminate it.  In 
such a volatile market, any user still has a meaningful chance of losing t heir money.  
What happens in the aftermath of these losses?  On an individual level, one possibility is 
a dispute between the intermediary and its customers over poor due diligence, poor financial advice, poor management practices, and so on.  Resolving those disputes individually can be costly .  So, it’s no surprise that intermediaries would ask for some kind of protection from 
them—some standard rules of the road that, if followed, create at least some  presumption of 
proper conduct.  As a result, intermed iaries can eventually demand regulation to protect 
themselves.  
From a social perspective, there is another possible outcome when losses become 
widespread : Those losses become practically, politically, or morally intolerable.  When everyday 
investors start losing their life savings, for no reason except wanting to participate in a hot market, demands for collective action can mount quickly.  History shows that t here will be 
demands to make individual investors “whole” by socializing their individual losses.  We saw it 
just a few weeks ago after what can only be described as a run on the Terra  ecosystem , when

concern .  5 
 
everyday users were seeking restitution and even experienced DeFi players were discussing ways 
to compensate retail investors.7   
This leads us to the main reason , in my view, that society wants to regulate new and 
poorly understood markets for financial products.  It’s not to protect high-net-worth investors but to protect society from the often -irresistible  pressure to socialize the losses of investors  with 
limited resources, and to limit the spread of financial stress.
8  The desire for a backstop can 
emerge even in an isolated failure—to say nothing of a systemwide event —when uncertainty or 
private informa tion moves stress from one asset class to others.  By definition, those financial 
externalities —which central banks, including the Fed, monitor closely —can create losses that 
innocent parties never signed up for and couldn’t have controlled.9  Those are t he kinds of losses 
that the public often gets asked to cover —and when they do, very often, the public also asks for 
new oversight and regulations , so the same mistakes don’t happen again.   
 In summary, financial regulation is typically demanded (1) by financial intermediaries as 
a form of liability protection and (2) by the taxpayer to prevent socialization of individual losses.  
It does not arise to protect sophisticated, experienced, well-i nformed investors.  On the contrary: 
Large -scale losses can easily occur  even  if th ese investors are getting the information they need 
to make decisions and are otherwise following the rules.  If we want to allow broad access to the 
crypto ecosystem, then the question isn’t about what experienced users of that ecosystem want —
it’s about what the rest of the public needs to have confidence in the ecosystem’s safety , and f or

 Good afternoon.  It is a pleasure to welcome everyone, including colleagues from the 
Bank for International Settlements (BIS)  and in particular from the BIS Innovation Hub, to the 
opening of the New York Innovation Center.   
The pace of technological change and innovation over the last decade has led some to 
argue that we are on the brink of a fourth industrial revolution—a digital revolution.  Certainly, 
rapid innovation, including through the application of advanced  digital technologies, machine 
learning, artificial intelligence, and big data, is revolutionizing the financial sector.  The Federal 
Reserve has a mandate to understand and , in some cases,  manage these changes , but it also has a 
responsibility to be at the forefront  of change  to deliver to the American people —and the 
international community —a reliable , efficient, and inclusive monetary  and financial system.    
Furthering the efforts around the Federal Reserve S ystem to harness the power of 
innovation, I am delighted to welcome the opening of the New York Innovation Center.  L ocated 
at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in the heart of the most important financial center in 
the world, this Innovation Center  will draw o n the expertise at the bank, in  the Federal Reserve 
System, and from the broader financial community, as well as  experts around the world to 
analyze and bring technology to bear on improving the  global financial system.  
Increasing the synergies of the New York  Innovation Center will be its strategic 
partner ship with the BIS Innovation Hub , recently established to foster dialogue, collaboration 
and knowledge -sharing among central banks and other authorities  and institutions .  In particular, 
the partnership w ill support our analysis of digital currencies —including central bank digital 
currencies; help to improve our current payment system —with a particular focus on making 
cross -border payments faster and less expensive; and it will provide new tools to aid our  
supervision of the financial system.    
 Linking up with the BIS in this way will enhance our ability to collaborate with central 
banks around the world and will ensure that the best and most up-to -date information, research, 
and practices  are flowing freel y.  Since its inception in January 2020, I have served as head of 
the BIS Innovation Hub Advisory Committee  and am very pleased that the Federal Reserve will 
be able to partner with the Hub in this important way.  
So I want to extend my thanks to President Williams, Agustin Carstens, and all those that 
worked on the establishment of this  center .  And I look forward to the advances of both these 
institutions in supporting innovation in service to the safety and soundness of the financial 
system.  
Thank you.  ",2021-11-29,powell

May 20 , 2019  
  
It is a pleasure to be here at  this important annual event sponsored and organized 
by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s Center for Financial Innovation and Stability.  
The risks in our financial system are constantly evolving.  Fifteen years ago, everyone 
was talking about whether households were borrowing too much.  Today everyone is 
talking about whether businesses are borrowing too much.  This evening, I will focus on 
the implications of the increase in business debt over the past decade and review the steps 
the Federal Reserve and other agencies are taking to understand and limit the associated 
risks.   
In public discussion of this issue, views seem to range from “ This is a rerun of the 
subprime mortgage crisis” to “ Nothing to worry about here.”  At the moment, the truth is 
likely somewhere in the middle.  To preview my conclusions, as of now, business debt 
does not present the kind of elevated risks to the stability of the financial system that 
would lead to broad harm to households and businesses  should conditions deteriorate.  At 
the same time, the level of debt certainly could stress borrowers if the economy 
weakens.   The Federal Reserve continues to assess the potential amplification of such 
stresses on borrowers to the broader economy through possible vulnerabilities in the 
financial system, and I currently see such risks as moderate.   
Discussion  
Many commentators have observed with a sense of déjà vu the buildup of risky 
business debt over the past few years.  The acronyms have changed a bit —“CLOs ” 
(collateralized loan obligations) instead of “ CDOs ” (collateralized debt obligations), for 
example—but once again, we see a category of debt that is growing faster than the 
income  of the borrowers even as lenders loosen underwriting standards .  Like wise, much  - 2 - 
of the borrowing is financed opaque ly, outside the banking system.  Many are asking 
whether these developments pose a new threat to financial stability.  
At the Federal Reserve, we take this possibility seriously.   The Fed and other 
regulators a re using our supervisory tools and closely monitoring  risks from the buildup 
of risky business debt.  B usiness debt has clearly reached a level that should give 
businesses and investors reason to pause and reflect.  If financial and economic 
conditions wer e to deteriorate, overly indebted firms could well face severe strains.  
However, the parallels to the mortgage boom that led to the Global Financial Crisis are 
not fully convincing.  Most importantly, the financial system today appears strong 
enough to ha ndle potential business -sector losses, which was manifestly not the case a 
decade ago with subprime mortgages.  And there are other differences:  I ncreases in 
business borrowing are not outsized for such a long expansion, in contrast to the 
mortgage boom; business credit is not fueled by a dramatic asset price bubble , as 
mortgage debt was;  and CLO  structures are much sounder than the structures that were in 
use during the mortgage credit bubble.  
Could the increase in business debt pose greater risks to the financial system than 
currently appreciated?  My colleagues and I continually ask ourselves  that question.  We 
are also taking multiple steps to better understand and address the potential risks.  In 
conjunction with other U.S. regulatory agencies, both domestically through the Financial 
Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and internationally through the Financial Stability 
Board (FSB), we are monitoring developments, assessing unknowns, and working to 
develop a clearer picture.  We are also using our superv isory tools to hold the banks we  - 3 - 
supervise to strong risk- management standards.  And we are using our stress tests to 
ensure banks’ resilience even in severely adverse business conditions . 
The Rise of Business Leverage  
Let’s start with the basic facts.  Many measures confirm that the business sector 
has significantly increased its borrowing as the economy has expanded over the past 
decade.  Business debt relative to the size of the economy is at historic highs.  Corporat e 
debt relative to the book value of assets is at the upper end of its range over the past few 
decades (figure 1).  And investment -grade corporate debt has shifted closer to the edge of 
speculative grade.   
At the moment, the business sector is quite healt hy overall.  Business income is 
strong, reflecting healthy profit margins.  And because interest rates are quite low by 
historical standards, the costs of servicing today’s higher levels of debt remain low 
relative to business income (figure 2).  Despite c rosscurrents, the economy is showing 
continued growth, strong job creation, and rising wages, all in a context of muted 
inflation pressures.   
But if a downturn were to arrive unexpectedly, some firms would face challenges.  
Not only is the volume of debt high, but recent growth has also been concentrated in the 
riskier forms of debt.  Among investment -grade bonds, a near -record fraction is at the 
lowest rating —a phenomenon known as the “triple -B cliff.”  In a downturn, some of 
these borrowers could be downgraded into high- yield territory, which would require 
some investors to sell their holdings, thereby confronting traditional high -yield investors 
with a sudden influx of bonds.    - 4 - 
There have also been sizable shifts within the non- investment -grade, or riskier, 
debt universe.  Higher -risk businesses have traditionally funded themselves with a mix of 
high-yield bonds and leveraged loans.  Over time , the balance between the two has swung 
back and forth because of investor demand, the interest rate environment, and other 
factors.  In the past few years, leveraged loans have grown far more quickly (figure 3).  In 
fact, while net new issuance of high -yield bonds in 2018 was close to nil, l everaged loans 
outstanding rose 20 percent and now stand at more than $1 trillion.  So far this year, 
issuance of high- yield bonds and leveraged loans has been more balanced.  In addition, 
underwriting standards have weakened.  With leveraged loans, covena nts intended to 
protect lenders may be an endangered species; more loans now feature high debt -to-
earnings ratios; and the use of  optimistic projections including “earnings add- backs ” is 
becoming more common.  
The rise in riskier business borrowing has bee n funded principally by nonbank 
lenders.  Collateralized  loan obligations are now the largest lenders, with about 
62 percent of outstanding leveraged loans (figure 4).  These lenders are actively managed 
securitization vehicles that mostly buy higher -risk assets like leveraged loans.  CLOs, in 
turn, are funded by a slice of equity and layers of debt of varying seniority.  After CLOs, 
mutual funds are the next -largest vehicle for holding leveraged loans, with about 
20 percent of the market.  These funds allo w investors to redeem their shares daily, 
although the underlying loans take longer to sell.  As a result, investors may react to 
financial stress by trying to redeem their shares before the funds have sold their most 
liquid assets.  Widespread redemptions  by investors, in turn, could lead to widespread  - 5 - 
price pressures, which could affect all holders of loans, including CLOs and those that 
hold CLOs.  
Risks to Financial Stability:  Using the Framework Deployed s ince the Crisis  
As you can see, there are simi larities to the subprime mortgage crisis.  As with the 
mortgage boom, the business debt story begins with rapid growth of debt to new highs 
and a surge in lending to risky borrowers made possible by aggressive underwriting using 
securitization vehicles.   
But there are also important differences.  One difference is that financial 
authorities now closely monitor financial stability vulnerabilities on an ongoing basis, 
armed with lessons learned from the crisis.  The Board of Governors meets at least four 
times a year to assess threats to the financial system and is constantly monitoring 
developments.  We use a checklist of potential financial vulnerabilities that we have 
described elsewhere, most recently in the Financial Stability Report  we published earlier  
this month.1  This approach gives us a  way to organize and weigh the mass of facts, 
anecdotes, and speculation we confront as we monitor financial stability.  
In assessing financial stability risks, we constantly consult our four -point 
checklist:  borrowi ng by businesses and households, valuation pressures, leverage in the 
financial system, and funding risk.  If households or businesses have borrowed too much, 
they will be forced to cut back spending and investing or even default if their incomes fall 
or the value of the collateral backing their loans declines.  Valuation pressures give us a 
sense of overall risk appetite and, should investors lose that appetite, how far prices could 
fall.  If lenders face defaulting borrowers and have too little loss -absor bing capacity, they 
                                                 
1 See Board of Governors (2019).   - 6 - 
risk insolvency.  At best, they will cut back on lending to other borrowers, dragging the 
economy down.  At worst, they will fail, which can lead to severe economic damage to 
households and businesses .  Finally, when the financial syste m funds long- maturity assets 
with short -maturity liabilities, we risk a classic “fast burn” crisis —a bank run, or its 
equivalent involving investors and institutions outside traditional banking.2   
In our framework, the story of the mid- 2000s goes something like this:  Amid a 
self-reinforcing cycle of house price gains and mortgage credit expansion, households 
borrowed (and lenders lent) far too much, and property prices rose far too high.  F inancial 
institutions of all shapes and sizes also borrowed too much .  And the financial sector was 
highly susceptible to a run because it funded risky, long -maturity mortgages with 
extended chains of fragile and opaque financing structures that ultimately rested on short -
maturity liabilities.   
Let’s compare this story with the current situation using our four -point checklist, 
beginning with borrowing by businesses and households.  Business debt has grown faster 
than gross domestic product (GDP) for several years and today is high.  But the growth in 
the ratio of busines s debt to GDP in the past decade is much less than the growth in 
household debt to GDP that we saw in the run- up to the Global Financial Crisis .  Back 
then, household debt grew from 60 percent of GDP to 90 percent, or by half (figure 5).  
At its recent low , business debt was 65 percent of GDP.  Now, even after rapid growth, it 
is still below 75 percent of GDP.  Overall, the increase in business debt relative to the 
                                                 
2 The Board’s Financial Stability Report discusses the analytical framework.  For a longer and more 
academic discussion, see Adrian, Covitz, and Liang (2015).  For research on the role of credit, house prices, 
and other factors as indicators for potential financial instability, see Borio and Lowe (2002); Schularick and 
Taylor (2012); Jor dà, Schularick, and Taylor (2016); and Kiley (2018).  For research on the role of bank 
capital, see Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2010); Macroeconomic Assessment Group (2010); 
and Firestone, Lorenc, and Ranish (2017).   - 7 - 
size of the economy is one -third the increase in household debt seen in the previous 
decade.  Business debt rises in expansions.  It is a steady upward plod in borrowing over 
the long expansion—not a rapid expansion—that has now brought business debt to GDP 
back to historic highs.  Seen this way, the current situation looks typical of business 
cycles.  The mortgage credit boom was, because of its magnitude and speed, far outside 
historical norms.3   
As for household debt, we see that household debt -to-income ratios have steadily 
declined post -crisis.  Moreover, a high and rising fraction of this debt is rated prime.  All 
told, household debt burdens appear much more manageable.  
Our second factor —valuation pressures —also points to moderate risks to 
financial stability.  Valuations are high across several financial markets.  Equity prices 
have recen tly reached new highs, and corporate bond and loan spreads are narrow.  Both 
commercial and residential property prices have moved above their long- run relationship 
with rents, although price gains slowed substantially last year.  All of these developments  
point to strong risk appetite —as might be expected given the strong economy.  But there 
does not appear to be a feedback loop between borrowing and asset prices, as was the 
case in the run -up to the financial crisis.  While borrowing by businesses has bee n strong, 
it is not fueling excessive prices or investment in a critical sector such as housing, whose 
collapse would undermine collateral values and lead to outsized losses.  Instead, the 
increase in business borrowing has been broad based across sectors, including 
technology, oil and gas production, and manufacturing.  
                                                 
3 For an analysis of the degree to which housing market developments in the 2000s appeared unrelated to 
economic fundamentals and references to related research, see Dokko and others (2011).   - 8 - 
Regarding the third factor —leverage in the financial system —today banks at the 
core of the financial system are fundamentally stronger and more resilient.  Our post -
crisis regulatory framewo rk is based on robust capital requirements backed by  strong 
stress test s, resulting in much higher levels of capital in the banking system (figure 6).  
These stress tests are a way to estimate the direct and indirect effects of extremely bad 
macroeconomic and financial developments on our banking system.  We publish the 
scenarios that describe the macro and financial developments every year by mid -February  
and release the test results in June.  In the pre -crisis environment, supervisors focused 
more on the most likely outcomes, not on these tail risks.  Since we began routine stress -
testing in 2011, the scenarios we use have featured severe global recessions characterized 
by major stress in the corporate sector, where large numbers of firms default on their 
loans and bonds.  As actual economic conditions have improved, the scenarios have 
gotten tougher.  The most recent stress tests indicate that, even after the losses from the 
scenario,  capital levels at the largest banks would remain above the levels those banks 
had before the crisis.   Loss -absorbing capacity elsewhere in the financial system is also 
much improved.  Leverage at broker -dealers is far below levels before the crisis and 
remains low relative to the norms of the past several decades.  Insurers al so appear well 
capitalized.  
As for our fourth factor —funding risk—the susceptibility of the financial system 
to runs also appears low.  In part because of the post -crisis regulatory regime, large banks 
hold substantial amounts of highly liquid assets and r ely relatively little on short- term 
wholesale funding (figure 7).  Money market funds hold much safer assets.  And CLOs, 
which have facilitated the growth of leveraged loans, have stable funding:  Investors  - 9 - 
commit funds for lengthy periods, so they cannot, through withdrawals, force CLOs to 
sell assets at distressed prices.   
Addressing the Risks:  Monitoring and Acting  
Overall, vulnerabilities to financial stability from business debt and other factors 
do not appear elevated.  We take the risks from busine ss debt seriously but think that the 
financial system appears strong enough to handle potential losses.  We also know that our 
dynamic financial system does not stand still.  We can always learn more about financial 
markets, and we will always act to address emerging risks.  Together with our domestic 
and international counterparts, we are monitoring developments in business debt markets, 
working to develop and share data on how these markets operate, studying ways to 
further strengthen the system, and working to ensure that banks are properly managing 
the business debt risks they have taken on.  
Through the FSOC, the banking and market regulators coordinate our monitoring 
of financial conditions.  In recent meetings, the FSOC has discussed leveraged lending  in 
depth.  We recognize that each regulator directly sees only a part of the larger picture, 
and we are working to stitch these parts together so we can collectively see that larger 
picture and the risks it holds.  For example, the Securities and Exchange  Commission is 
examining the potential for liquidity strains at mutual funds, and the Commodity Futures 
Trading Commission is working to understand the use of derivatives to hedge risks 
associated with leveraged loans.   
What else are we watching for?  Bus iness debt growth has moderated somewhat 
since early 2018, but this might be just a pause.  Another sharp increase in debt, unless 
supported by strong fundamentals, could increase vulnerabilities appreciably.   - 10 - 
Businesses, investors, and lenders need to foc us on these vulnerabilities —as will the 
Federal Reserve.  
In addition, regulators, investors, and market participants around the world would 
benefit greatly from more information on who is bearing the ultimate risk associated with 
CLOs .  We know that the U.S. CLO market spans the globe, involving foreign banks and 
asset managers.  But right now, we mainly know where the CLOs are not —only 
$90 billion of the roughly $700 billion in total CLOs are held by the largest U.S. banks.  
That is certainly good news for  domestic banks, but in a downturn institutions anywhere 
could find themselves under pressure, especially those with inadequate loss -absorbing 
capacity or runnable short -term financing.  T he Federal Reserve is participating in 
international efforts, under the auspices of the FSB, to improve our knowledge of these 
key issues.  Through t he FSB , we are focused on determin ing the size of the global 
leveraged loan market and the holders of the loans as an important step toward a better 
understanding of the under lying risks . 
Beyond monitoring markets and collecting new data, several supervisory efforts 
are also under way.  To complement the quantitative analysis in our stress tests, our 
supervisor s have been  qualitatively assessing how well banks are managing the risks 
associated with leveraged lending.  Through the Shared National Credit Program, which 
evaluates large syndicated loans, our supervisors are continuing to work with their 
counterparts at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal De posit 
Insurance Corporation to ensure that banks are properly managing the risks of losses they 
face from participating in the leveraged lending market.    - 11 - 
Conclusion  
Let me wrap up with three thoughts.  First, business debt is near record levels, and 
recent  issuance has been concentrated in the riskiest segments.  As a result, some 
businesses may come under severe financial strain if the economy deteriorates.  A highly 
leveraged business sector could amplify any economic downturn as companies are forced 
to lay off workers and cut back on investments.  Investors, financial institutions, and 
regulators need to focus on this risk today, while times  are good.   
Second, today business debt does not appear to present notable risks to financial 
stability.  The debt -to-GDP ratio has moved up at a steady pace, in line with previous 
expansions and neither fueled by nor fueling an asset bubble.  Moreover, banks and other 
financial institutions have sizable loss -absorbing buffers.  The growth in business debt 
does not rel y on short -term funding, and overall funding risk in the financial system is 
moderate.  
Third, we cannot be satisfied with our current level of knowledge about these 
markets, particularly the vulnerability of financial institutions to potential losses and the 
possible strains on market liquidity and prices should investors exit investment vehicles 
holding leveraged loans.  We are committed to better understanding the areas where our 
information is incomplete.  This commitment includes coordination with other  domestic 
and international agencies to understand who is participating in business lending and how 
their behavior could potentially amplify stress events.

Good afternoon.  I’d like to thank John Bryant and Operation HOPE for inviting 
me to speak  today .  I’d also like to congratulate Operation HOPE and the Ebenezer 
Baptist Church on the grand opening of the HOPE Financial Dignity Center , which holds 
the promise of becoming a tremendous resource for the people of Atlanta  and sits  next to 
Martin Lut her King’s home church .  Dr. King’s legacy to our society is strong and 
enduring, and the new center is very much in the spirit of his work .    
The past few years have been difficult for many Americans and their 
communities.  At the Federal Reserve, we und erstand the depth of the problem and the 
need for action, and we will continue to use the policy tools that we have to help support 
economic recovery.   We also know  that the burdens of a weak econ omy and the benefits 
of economic growth  often are not equally shared, and that, to be truly effective,  
policymakers must take into account how their decisions affect the least advantaged, not 
just the economy as a whole.  
My remarks today will focus on a n important  part of our economy, the housing 
sector.  Hou sing and housing finance played a central role in  touching off  the financial 
crisis and the associated recession, and the ensuing wave of foreclosure s wreaked great 
damage on communities across the country.  As I will discuss, for the first time in a 
numbe r of years, the housing sector is improving, adding to grow th and jobs.  But the 
housing revival  still faces significant obstacles , and the benefits of that revival remain 
quite uneven.  Strengthening and broadening the housing recovery remain a critical 
challenge for policymakers , lenders, and community leaders .  The degree  to which that 
challenge is met will help determine the strength and sustainability of the economic 
recovery and the extent to which  its benefits are  broadly felt.  - 2 - 
 
 
 Developments in Housing and Housing Finance  
The multiyear boom and bust in housing prices  of the past decade , together with 
the sharp increase in mortgage delinquencies and defaults  that followed , were among the 
principal causes of the financial crisis and the ensuing dee p recession --a recession that 
cost some 8 million jobs.  And continue d weakness in housing --reflected in falling prices, 
low rates of new construction, and historic levels of foreclosure --has proved a powerful 
headwind to recovery.   It is encouraging, ther efore, that we are seeing signs of 
improvement in the housing market  in most parts of the country .  House prices  nationally 
have increased for nine consecutive months , residential investment  has risen about 
15 percent from its low point , and sales of both new and existing homes have edged up .1  
Homebuilder sentiment has improved considerably over the past year, and real  estate 
agents  report a substanti al rise in homebuyer traffic.  The growing demand for homes has 
been  underpinned by record levels of affordability, the result of  historically low mortgage 
rates and  house prices that are 30 percent or more below their peaks in many areas .  
To be sure, the housing sector is far from being out of the woods.   Construction  
activity , sales, and prices remain much lower than they were before the crisis.  A bout 
20 percent of mortgage borrowers remain  underwater --that is, they owe more than their 
homes are worth .  Despite marked improvements in overall credit quality, 7 percent of  
mortgages are either more than 90 days overdue or in the process of foreclosure .2  And, 
although the number of homes in foreclosure has edged down since cresting  in 2010, that

existing structures and brokers’ commissions.  The s taff calculation of residential investment is based on 
data from  the national income and product accounts.  Home sales data are from the Census Bureau and the

 number remains in excess of 2 million, three times the historical norm.  Meanwhile, the 
national homeownership rate  has slipped nearly 4 percentage points from  its 2004 high  of 
69 percent,  and it now stands a t a 15-year low .3  So, although there are good reasons to be  
encouraged by the recent direction of the housing market, we should not be satisfied with 
the progress we have seen so far.  
Lower -income and minority communities  are often disproportionately affected by 
problems  in the nati onal economy, and the effects of the  housing bust  have followed that 
unfortunate pattern.   Indeed, as a result of the crisis, most or all of the hard -won gains in 
homeownership made by low -income and minority communities in the past 15 years or 
so have been reversed.  For example, among all  income groups, between 2007 and 2010 , 
homeownership rat es fell the most  for households with income of $20,000 or less, 
according to the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances.4  Data from the Census 
Bureau show that, o ver the period from 2004 to 2012, t he homeownership rate fell about 
5 percentage points  for Afric an Americans , compared with about  2 percentage  points for  
other groups .5 
Homeownership rates fall when existing homeowners lose or leave their 
properties, when barriers to homeownership increase , or both.  In recent years, both 
factors have  been important.  As I mentioned, home loss through foreclosure, though 
down from its peaks, remains an important problem, with low er-income and minority

 homeowners often being the hardest hit.  Importantly, foreclosures can inflict economic 
damage  beyond the personal suffering and dislocation that accompany them.  Foreclosed 
properties that sit vacant for months (or years) often deteriorate from neglect, adversely 
affecting not only the value of the individual property but the values of nearby homes  as 
well.  Concentrations of foreclosures have been shown to do serious damage to 
neighborhoods and communities, reducing tax bases and leading to increased vandalism 
and crime.  Thus, the overall effect of the foreclosure wave, especially when concentrated 
in lower-income and minority areas, is broader than its effects on individual homeowners.  
A strengthening housing market will help to gradually undo that damage, but the process 
has only begun.  
Homeownership rates have also declined because fewer households have chosen, 
or have been able, to become new homeowners in recent years.  Buying a home  usually 
means obtaining a mortgage, and the data show that the  pace of mortgage lending has 
fallen cons iderably on a national basis ; the extension of  first-lien mortgage s to purchase 
homes  fell by more than half from 2006 to 2011 and now stands at the lowest level since 
1995 .6  Again, the contraction in mortgage originations has  been particularly severe for 
minority groups and those with lower incomes :  Since the peak in mortgage lending in 
2006, the number of home -purchase loans extended to African  Americans  and Hispanics 
has fallen more than 65  percent , whereas lending to non -Hispanic whites has fallen less 
than 50  percent.  Home -purchase originations in low er-income neighborhoods have fallen 
about 75 percent, compared with around 50 percent for middle - and upper -income 
neighborhoods.

Act,” webpage,  www.ffiec.gov/hmda/default.htm . - 5 - 
 
 
 To be clear , the reduction  in mortgage  originations  and home purchases  for all 
groups  relative to the pre -crisis period partly reflects weakness in the effective demand 
for housing  rather than the unavailability of mortgage credit .  Unemployment , income 
loss, and income insecurity  prevent  many  households from purchasing homes , and 
concerns about the future direction of the labor market, housing prices, and the economy 
more generally keep other  potential buyers  on the sidelines .  In addition, the fall in home 
prices means that many current homeo wners cannot rely as much as they could in the 
past on tapping their existing home equity to trade up to larger or better homes, while  
underwater homeowners may be financially unable to move from  their current homes.   
Although the  decline in the number of willing and qualified  potential homebuyers 
explain s some of the contraction in mortgage lending of the past few years, I believe that 
tight credit  nevertheless  remains an important factor  as well .  The Federal Reserve’s 
Senior Loa n Officer Opinion Survey  on Bank Lending Practices indicates  that lenders 
began tightening mortgage credit standards in 2007 and have not significantly eased 
standards since.7  Terms and s tandards  have tightened most for borrowers with lower 
credit scores  and with less money  available  for a down payment.   For example, in April 
nearly 60 percent of lenders reported that they would be  much less likely, relative to 
2006, to originate a conforming  home -purchase mortgage to a borrower  with a 10 percent 
down pay ment and  a credit  score  of 620 --a traditional marker for those with weaker 
credit histories .8  As a result, the share of  home -purchase borrowers with credit scores 
below 620  has fal len from about  17 percent of borrowers at the end of 2006 to about

 5 percent  more recently .9  Lenders also appear to have pulled back on offering these 
borrowers loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration ( FHA ).  
When lenders were  asked why they ha ve originated fewer mortgages , they cited a 
variety of concerns, starting with worries about the economy, the  outlook for house 
prices , and their existing real estate  loan exposure s.  They also mention  increases in 
servicing costs and the risk of being required by government -sponsored enterprises 
(GSEs) to repurchase de linquent loans (so -called putback risk).  Other concerns include  
the reduced availability of private mortgage insurance for conventional loans and some 
program -specific issues for FHA loans  as reasons for tighter standards .  Also, some 
evidence suggest s that mortgage originations for new purchases may be constrained 
because of processing  capacity , as high levels of refinancing have drawn on the  same 
personnel who would otherwise be available for handling loans  for purchase .  
Importantly, however, restrictive mortgage lending conditions do not seem to be linked to 
any insufficien cy of  bank capital or to a general unwillingness to lend.      
Certainly , some tightening of credit standards was an appropriate response to the 
lax lending conditions that prevailed in the years leading up to the peak in house prices.  
Mortgage loans that were poorly underwritten or inappropriate for the borrower’s 
circumstances ultimately  had devastating consequences  for many families  and 
communities,  as well as for the financial institutions  themselves  and the broader 
economy.   However, it seems likely at this point  that the pendulum has swung too far the 
other way, and that  overly tight lending standards may now be preventing creditworthy

 borrowers from buying homes , thereby slowing the revival in housing and  impeding the 
economic recovery.  
Policy Responses  
The factors contributing to reduced mortgage lending and lower rates of 
homeownership are varied and complex ; no simple  solutions  exist  that can, on their own,  
restore the housing market to health .  Since the extent of the crisis became apparent, a 
range of initiatives has been undertaken.   For example, a number of public and private 
efforts have been made to help avoid unnecessary foreclosures  and to enable  underwater  
and other  borrowers to refinance at lower interest rates.  Alternatives to foreclosure, 
including short sales and deed -in-lieu arrangements, have become more common.  The 
recent settlement with a group of large servicers includes provisions to improve the 
process for working with delinquent borrowers and to compensate foreclosed -upon 
homeowners who were unfairly treated in the past.    
As I have noted, vacant foreclosed homes lose value and create problems for 
neighborhoods.  The ov erhang of empty homes also slows the recovery of the housing 
market by keeping prices low and limiting the need for new construction.   To explore 
ways to address the number of foreclosed homes standing empty, the Federal Housing 
Finance Agency , which supervises the GSEs,  undertook a pilot initiative that made it 
easier for qualified investors to purchase pools of foreclosed properties from Fannie Mae; 
the acquired properties  would then be rented for a specified number of years.   For our 
part, the Feder al Reserve is encouraging the institutions we supervise to manage their 
inventories of foreclosed homes in ways that do not exacerbate problems in local - 8 - 
 
 
 neighborhoods, including renting them out, where appropriate, rather than leaving the 
properties vacant .10 
Policymakers have also taken steps to remove barriers to the flow of mortgage 
credit.   The Federal Housing Finance Agency  recently announced new rules that will 
provide mortgage lenders  greater clarity about the conditions under which they will be 
requi red to buy back defaulted mortgages from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  or 
otherwise address origination problems .  This greater clarity may result in r educed 
concern about putback risk , which in turn  should increase the willingness of lenders to 
make new loans.  In its rulemakings and supervision, the Federal Reserve, along with 
other bank supervisors, has worked with lenders to try to achieve an appropriate balance 
between reasonable prudence and ensuring that qualified borrowers are not denied access 
to credit.  
Although regulatory policy will be important for  restoring a fully functioning 
housing and mortgage market, the strength of the overall economic recovery is crucial as 
well.  Obviously, loss o f employment or income  makes it more difficult for families to 
pay their mortgages, maintain good credit histories , refinance their mortgages at lower 
rates, and avoid foreclosure.  People  who are worried about their jobs are understandably 
more reluctant to purchase homes, and households who have suffered hits to their 
incomes face difficult y qualifying for a mortgage and sav ing for a down payment.  
Concerns  about the financial strength  of household s and about the economic recovery 
also make lenders more cautious.

 At the Federal Reserve , we have sought to support the economic recovery and 
maintain price stability --the two goals given to us by the Congress --by keeping both 
short -term and long er-term in terest rates historically low.  Low interest rates reduce the 
cost to households of buying homes, cars, and other consumer durables while increasing 
the attractiveness of new capital investments by firms.  Increased demand in turn leads to 
faster economic growth  and more jobs.  My colleagues and I have been and remain  quite  
concerned about  the stubbornly  high level of unemployment --particularly long -term 
unemployment .  We have taken strong actions throughout the financial crisis and 
recovery  to help stabilize the economy .  In September, we took the added step of stating 
that we will continue actions to put downward pressure on long er-term interest rates until 
the outlook for the job market improves substantially in a context of price stabilit y.  Our 
hope is that our statement provide s individuals, families, businesses, and financial 
markets greater confid ence about the Federal Reserve’s  commitment to promoting a 
sustainable recovery  with price stability  and that, as a result, they will become more 
willing to invest, hire and spend.   In addition, of course, the historically low mortgage 
rates that have resulted from the Federal Reserve’s policies are directly supporting the 
housing market by putting homeownership within the reach of more people.     
While the economic recovery and regulatory policy affect access to credit for all 
households,  some  potential borrowers  may face the added burden of discrimination.  In 
our role as a banking regulator, the Federal Reserve strive s to ensure that the banks we 
supervise obey  laws that prohibit illegal discrimination  in lending .  I am reminded here 
that fair treatment in housing was a significant focus of Dr. King’s, and the Fair Housing - 10 - 
 
 
 Act of 1968 --still one of the nation’s cornerstone  laws to prohibit discrimination --was 
passed only a week after his assassination  and stands among his legacies .   
Two types  of discrimination continue to have  particular significance to mortgage 
markets :  One is redlining, in which mortgage lenders discriminate against minority 
neighborhoods , and the other is  pricing discrimination, in which lenders charge 
minorities higher loan prices than they would to comparable nonminority borrowers.   The 
Federal Reserve has  been  vigilant in identifying and stopping such abuses, and we remain  
committed to vigorous enforcement of the nation’s fair lending laws.  We currently co -
chair , with the Department of Justice, an interagency task force to promote robust fair 
lending super vision and enforcement.   
Government policies, both microeconomic and macroeconomic, have an 
important role to play in restoring the health of the housing sector.  However, government 
can only be part of the solution; in the remainder of my remarks I will d iscuss what 
others can do, including potential homeowners themselves.  
Financial Preparedness  and Homeownership  
One lesson of the past few years is that  the desire to own a home is not enough.  
Although many foreclosures resulted from job loss or other economic hardships, others  
occurred because people  bought more of a house than they could afford, took out a loan  
that was not appropriate to their circumstances, or did not manage their resources well .  
Future homeownership must be built on a more solid foundation.   And while much of the 
responsibility for building that foundation must lie with  lenders and with regulators , 
consumers must do their part as well by acquiring  the information and financial - 11 - 
 
 
 knowledge  they need to make sound decisions .  Operation H OPE  has made this point 
frequently and forcefully.  
Effective f inancial education --aimed at both youth s and adults --can provide 
people  with the knowledge they need .  Some of the skills that prospective homeowners 
need are relatively basic --for example , knowing how to shop for the lowest interest rate  
and fees , understanding the difference between a fixed -rate and an adjustable -rate 
mortgage, and , very importantly , knowing  how to find trustworthy information and 
advice.   More generally, the decision to buy a home  must  be consistent with a family’s 
longer -term objectives, needs, and resources.  Good  financial planning --including 
effective budgeting, adequate saving, and  sensible investing --can help families maintain 
homeownership  while also pursuing other important objectives, such as preparing for  
retirement  or financial emergencies.   And financially informed households will have a 
better chance to build wealth, reducin g--in the case of minority households --the large 
wealth gap that exists between minorities and other groups.   
At the Federal Reserve, we appreciate the benefits to families of acquiring basic 
information and skills  about managing their money .  But we see another important 
advantage of financial education , which is that an economy with financially 
knowledgeable households  is likely to be stronger, more  equal, and more stable.   As such , 
we all gain from efforts to increase financial literacy.  
Altho ugh basic knowledge  about money management and decisionmaking  is 
extremely useful, it is not practical, of course,  for everyone to be a financial expert.  
Sometimes a professional  can help, and people should not be afraid to seek advice at 
appropriate time s.  For example, an individual may be involved in buying a home --a - 12 - 
 
 
 complex and intimidating experience for many  people --only once or twice in a lifetime.   
That’s why advice from a housing counselor at the right point in the process can make all 
the differe nce.  Nonprofit organizations can help prospective homeowners assess their 
readiness to purchase.  And, by provid ing useful information about how to search for a 
home, apply for financing, handle home maintenance, and prevent delinquency , these 
nonprofits can help aspiring homebuyers find the right home and maintain their mortgage 
payments.11  We have also seen that counseling can help consumers who are facing 
delinquency or default.  Borrowers  in trouble who receive foreclosure counseling  are 
relatively more likely to subsequently become current on their mortgage , receive a loan 
modification , and, ultimately, keep their home .12   
Financial preparedness is  important not only  for prospective homebuyers.  It 
ought to be a lifelong undertaking, starting with children and teenagers.   Organizations 
around the country --including Operation HOPE --help people across a range of ages 
develop their skills.  Despite , or perhaps because of,  the broader economic challenges  we 
face, it now seems to be a time of creativity and innovation in this field.  We are seeing 
experimentation, knowledge sharing, public -private collaborations, “bottom up” 
community -driven approaches , and state - and local -government efforts to promote family 
financial security  and opportunity.   
More generally, community organizations like Operation HOPE have played an 
important role in helping low -income and minority communities weather the storm of the 
past few years.  Besides promoting financial literacy and providing counseling  (and

 sometimes credi t) for homebuyers, community organizations have helped build small 
businesses through investment and technical assistance.   Organizations such as 
Neighbor Works America (and as an aside, Federal Reserve Governor Sarah Bloom 
Raskin currently chairs  its board) have been leaders in fighting the blight in 
neighborhoods with high rates of foreclosure.  Unfortunately, just as families have been 
hurt by the financial crisis  and recession , so have many community -based  organizations.  
These groups  face the daunt ing task of finding new sources of capital and investment in a 
constrained financial environment.  Some organizations have begun to retool their 
operations and develop new markets, products , and strategies to better serve the financial 
needs of consumers a nd communities.   Among other goals, they are developing strategies 
to foster responsible homeownership, which they see as an important building block for 
stronger communities.   
To return to where I began, after a long and difficult period, we are seeing  
welcome signs of improvement in the housing market.  An improving housing market 
will in turn aid the economic recovery while strengthening neighborhoods and increasing 
the financial well -being of families.   Our recovery must be broadly felt to be complete, 
and families  and communities that were already struggling before the crisis must be  
included in that recovery .  As Dr. King is widely quoted to have said , “We may have all 
come on different ships, but we ’re in the same boat now. ” 
The Federal Reserve will continue to  do what we can to  support the housing 
recovery , both  through our monetary policy and our regulatory and supervisory actions.  
But, as I have discussed, not all of the responsibility lies with the government; 
households , the financial services industry,  and those in the nonprofit sector must play - 14 - 
 
 
 their part as well.  In that spirit, I would like to close by express ing my appreciation and 
admiration for the work that so many of you are doing to restore our neighborhoods and 
to help  individuals and families regain a solid financial footing.   
Thank you.

Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy Review  
 
 
Remarks by  
 
Jerome H. Powell  
 
Chair  
 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  
 
at the 
 
Council on Foreign Relations  
 
New York, New York  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
June 25, 2019  
  
Good afternoon.  It is a pleasure to speak at  the Council on Foreign Relations.  I 
will begin with a progress report on the broad public review my Federal Reserve 
colleagues and I are conducting of the strategy, tools , and co mmunication practices we 
use to achieve the objectives Congress has assigned to us by law —maximum 
employment and price stability, or the dual mandate.  Then I will discuss the outlook for 
the U.S. economy and monetary policy.  I look forward to the discuss ion that will follow.  
During our public review, we are seeking perspectives from people across the 
nation, and we are doing so through open public meetings live -streamed on the i nternet.  
Let me share some of the thinking behind this review, which is the f irst of its nature we 
have undertaken.  T he Fed is i nsulated from short -term political pressures —what is often 
referred to as our “independence.”  Congress chose to insulate the Fed  this way because it 
had seen the damage that often arises when policy bend s to short -term political interests.   
Central banks in major democracies around the world have similar independence.   
Along with this independence comes the obligation to explain clearly what we are 
doing and why we are doing it, so that the public and their elected representatives in  
Congress can hold us accountable.  But real accountability demands more of us than clear 
explanation:  We must listen.  We must actively engage those we serve to understand 
how we can more effectively and faithfully use the powers they have entrusted to us.  
That is why we  are formally and publicly open ing our  decisionmaking to suggestions, 
scrutiny , and critique.  With unemployment low, the economy growing, and inflation near 
our symmetric 2 percent objective, this is a good time to undertake such a review.   
Another factor motivating the review is that the challenges of monetary 
policymaking have changed in a fundamental way in recent years.  Interest rates are  - 2 - 
lower than in the past, and likely to remain so.  The persistenc e of lower rates means  that, 
when the economy turns down, interest rates will more likely fall close to zero —their 
effective lower bound (ELB ).  Proximity to the ELB poses new problems to central banks 
and calls for new ideas.  W e hope to benefit from the best thinking on these issues.   
At the heart of the review are our Fed Listens  events, which include  town  hall–
style meetings in all 12 Federal Reserve Districts.  These meetings bring together people 
with wide -ranging perspectives, interests, and expertis e.  We also want to benefit from 
the insights of leading economic  researchers.  We recently held a conference at the 
Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago that combined research presentations by top scholars 
with roundtable discussions among leaders  of organizat ions that serve union workers, 
low- and moderate -income  communities, small businesses, and people struggling to find 
work.   
We have  been listening.  What have we heard?  Scholars at the Chicago  event  
offered  a range of views on how well  our monetary polic y tools have effectively 
promoted our dual mandate.  We learned more about cutting -edge ways to measure job 
market conditions.  We heard the latest perspectives on what financial and trade links 
with the rest of the world mean for the conduct of monetary policy.  We heard  scholarly 
views on the interplay between monetary policy and financial stability.  And we heard a 
review of the clarity and the efficacy of our communications.  
Like many others at the conference, I was particularly struck by two panels  that 
included people who work every day in low - and middle -income communities.  What we 
heard, loud and clear, was that today’s tight labor markets mean that the benefits of this 
long recovery are now reaching these communities to a degree that has not been f elt for  - 3 - 
many years.  We heard of companies , communities , and schools  working together to 
bring employers the productive workers they need —and of employers working creatively 
to structure jobs so that employees can do their jobs while coping with the demands of 
family and life beyond the workplace.  We heard that many p eople who , in the past , 
struggled to stay in the workforce are now getting an opportunit y to add new and better 
chapters to their life stories.  All of this underscores how important it is to sustain this 
expansion. 
The conference generated vibrant discussions.  We heard that we are doing many  
things well, that we have much we can improve, and that there  are different views about 
which is which.  That disagreement is  neither  surprising  nor unwelcome .  The questions 
we are confronting  about monetary policymaking and communication, particularly those 
relating to the ELB, are difficult ones that have grown in urgency over the past two 
decades .  That  is why it is so important that we actively seek opinions, ideas, and 
critiques from people throughout the economy to refine our understanding of how best to 
use the monetary policy powers Congress has granted us.   
Beginning soon, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will devote  time at 
its regular meetings to assess the lessons from these events, supported by analys is by staff 
from around the Federal Reserve System.  We will publicly report the conclusions of our 
discussions, likely during the first half of next year.  In the meantime, anyone w ho is 
interested in learning more can find information on the Federal Reserve Board’s 
website .1

communications -fed-listens -events.htm .  - 4 - 
Let me turn now from the longer -term issues that are the focus of the review to 
the nearer -term outlook for the economy and for monetary policy.  So far this ye ar, the 
economy has performed reasonably well.  Solid fundamentals are supporting continued 
growth and strong job creation, keeping the unemployment rate near historic lows.  Although 
inflation has been running somewhat below our symmetric 2 percent object ive, we have 
expected it to pick up, supported by solid growth and a strong job market.  Along with this 
favorable picture, we have been mindful of some ongoing crosscurrents, including trade 
developments and concerns about global growth.  When the FOMC me t at the start of May, 
tentative evidence suggested these crosscurrents were moderating, and we saw no strong case 
for adjusting our policy rate.  
Since then , the picture has changed.  The crosscurrents have reemerged, with 
apparent progress on trade turning to greater uncertainty and with incoming data raising 
renewed concerns about the strength of the global economy.  Our contacts in business 
and agriculture report heightened concerns over trade developments.  These concerns 
may have contributed to the drop in business confidence in some recent surveys and may 
be starting to show through to incoming data.  For example, the limited available 
evidence we have suggests that investment by businesses has slowed from the pace 
earlier in the year.   
Against the ba ckdrop of heightened uncertainties, the baseline outlook of my 
FOMC colleagues, like that of many other forecasters, remains favorable, with 
unemployment remaining near historic lows.  Inflation is expected to return to 2 percent 
over time, but at a somewhat slower pace than we foresaw earlier in the year.  However, 
the risks to this favorable baseline outlook appear to have grown.    - 5 - 
Last week, my FOMC colleagues and I held our regular meeting to assess the 
stance of monetary policy.  We did not change the setting for our main policy tool, the 
target range for the federal funds rate, but we did make significant changes in our policy 
statement.  Since the beginning of the year, we had been taking a patient stance toward 
assessing the need for any policy chang e.  We now state t hat the Committee will closely 
monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as 
appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its 
symmetric 2 percent objective .   
The question my colleagues and I are grappling with is whether these 
uncertainties  will continue to weigh on the outlook and thus call for additional policy 
accommodation.  Many FOMC participants judge that the case for somewhat more 
accommodative poli cy has strengthened.  But we are also mindful that monetary policy 
should not overreact to any individual data point or short -term swing in sentiment.  Doing 
so would risk adding even more uncertainty to the outlook.  We will  closely monitor  the 
implicatio ns of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as 
appropriate to sustain the expansion. ",2019-06-25,powell

Five Questions about the Federa l Reserve and Monetary Policy 
   
Remarks by 
 
Ben S. Bernanke 
 
Chairman 
 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
 
at 
 
The Economic Club of Indiana 
 
Indianapolis, Indiana 
       
October 1, 2012 
 
  
 Good afternoon.  I am pleased to be able to join the Economic Club of Indiana for 
lunch today.  I note that the mission of th e club is “to promote an interest in, and 
enlighten its membership on, important govern mental, economic and social issues.”  I 
hope my remarks today will meet that standar d.  Before diving in, I’d like to thank my 
former colleague at the White House, Al Hubbard, for helping to make this event 
possible.  As the head of the National Ec onomic Council under President Bush, Al had 
the difficult task of making sure that divers e perspectives on economic policy issues were 
given a fair hearing before re commendations went to the President.  Al had to be a 
combination of economist, polit ical guru, diplomat, and tra ffic cop, and he handled it 
with great skill.  
My topic today is “Five Questions a bout the Federal Reserve and Monetary 
Policy.”  I have used a question-and-answer format in talks before, and I know from 
much experience that people are eager to know more about the Federal Reserve, what we 
do, and why we do it.  And that interest is even broader than one might think.  I’m a 
baseball fan, and I was excited to be invited to a recent ba tting practice of the playoff-
bound Washington Nationals.  I wa s introduced to one of the team’s star players, but 
before I could press my questions on some fi ne points of baseball strategy, he asked, “So, 
what’s the scoop on quantitativ e easing?”  So, for that player, for club members and 
guests here today, and for anyone else curious  about the Federal Re serve and monetary 
policy, I will ask and answ er these five questions: 
1. What are the Fed’s objectives, and how is it trying to meet them? 
2. What’s the relationship between the Fe d’s monetary policy and the fiscal 
decisions of the Administration and the Congress?  - 2 -
3. What is the risk that the Fed’s accomm odative monetary policy will lead to 
inflation? 
4. How does the Fed’s monetary policy affect savers and investors? 
5. How is the Federal Reserve held acc ountable in our democratic society? 
What Are the Fed’s Objectives, and How Is It Trying to Meet Them?  
 The first question on my list concerns th e Federal Reserve’s objectives and the 
tools it has to try to meet them. 
As the nation’s central bank, the Federa l Reserve is charged with promoting a 
healthy economy--broadly speaking, an economy with low unemployment, low and stable inflation, and a financial system th at meets the economy’s needs for credit and 
other services and that is not itself a sour ce of instability.  We pursue these goals through 
a variety of means.  Together with other federal supervisory agencies, we oversee banks 
and other financial institutions.  We monitor the financial system as a whole for possible 
risks to its stability.  We encourage financial and economic  literacy, promote equal access 
to credit, and advance local economic development by working with communities, nonprofit organizations, and others around the country.  We also provide some basic 
services to the financial s ector--for example, by processi ng payments and distributing 
currency and coin to banks.   
But today I want to focus on a role that is  particularly identified with the Federal 
Reserve--the making of mone tary policy.  The goals of monetary policy--maximum 
employment and price stability--are given to  us by the Congress.  These goals mean, 
basically, that we would like to see as many Americans as possible who want jobs to 
have jobs, and that we aim to keep the rate of increase in consumer prices low and stable.  - 3 -
 In normal circumstances, the Federal Reserve implements monetary policy 
through its influence on short-term interest rates,  which in turn affect other interest rates 
and asset prices.1  Generally, if economic weakness is  the primary concern, the Fed acts 
to reduce interest rates, which supports th e economy by inducing businesses to invest 
more in new capital goods and by leading households to spend more on houses, autos, 
and other goods and services.  Likewise, if the economy is overhea ting, the Fed can raise 
interest rates to help cool total demand and constrain inflationary pressures.   
Following this standard approach, the Fed cut short-term interest rates rapidly 
during the financial crisis, reducing them to nearly zero by the end of 2008--a time when 
the economy was contracting sharply.  At that point, however, we faced a real challenge:  
Once at zero, the short-term interest rate could not be cut further, so our traditional policy 
tool for dealing with economic weakness was no longer available.  Yet, with 
unemployment soaring, the economy and job ma rket clearly needed more support.  
Central banks around the world found themselves  in a similar predicament.  We asked 
ourselves, “What do we do now?”  To answer this question, we could dr aw on the experience of  Japan, where short-
term interest rates have been near zero for many years, as well as a good deal of academic 
work.  Unable to reduce short-term interest rates further, we looked instead for ways to 
influence longer-term interest rates, which remained well above zero.  We reasoned that, 
as with traditional monetary policy, bri nging down longer-term rates should support 
economic growth and employment by loweri ng the cost of borrowing to buy homes and 
                                                 
1 The Fed has a number of ways to influence short-term  rates; basically, they involve steps to affect the 
supply, and thus the cost, of short-term funding.  - 4 -
cars or to finance capital i nvestments.  Since 2008, we’v e used two types of less-
traditional monetary policy tools to  bring down longer-term rates.   
The first of these less-traditional tool s involves the Fed purchasing longer-term 
securities on the open mark et--principally Treasury securities and mortgage-backed 
securities guaranteed by government-sponsor ed enterprises such as Fannie Mae and 
Freddie Mac.  The Fed’s purchases reduce th e amount of longer-term securities held by 
investors and put downward pre ssure on the interest rates on  those securities.  That 
downward pressure transmits to a wide range  of interest rates that individuals and 
businesses pay.  For example, when the Fe d first announced purchases of mortgage-
backed securities in late 2008, 30-year mortgage interest ra tes averaged a little above 
6 percent; today they average about 3-1/2 per cent.  Lower mortgage rates are one reason 
for the improvement we have been seeing in  the housing market, which in turn is 
benefiting the economy more broadly.  Other impor tant interest rates, such as corporate 
bond rates and rates on auto loans, have also come down.  Lower interest rates also put 
upward pressure on the prices of assets, su ch as stocks and ho mes, providing further 
impetus to household and business spending. 
The second monetary policy tool we have  been using involves communicating our 
expectations for how long the short-term inte rest rate will remain  exceptionally low.  
Because the yield on, say, a five-year security embeds market expectations for the course 
of short-term rates over the next five years,  convincing investors that we will keep the 
short-term rate low for a longer time can help to pull down market-determined longer-
term rates.  In sum, the Fed’s basic strategy for strengthening the economy--reducing interest rates and easing financial conditions mo re generally--is the same as it has always  - 5 -
been.  The difference is that, with the short-te rm interest rate nearly at zero, we have 
shifted to tools aimed at reducing long er-term interest rates more directly. 
 Last month, my colleagues and I used  both tools--securities purchases and 
communications about our future actions--in  a coordinated way to further support the 
recovery and the job market.  Why did we  act?  Though the economy has been growing 
since mid-2009 and we expect it to continue to expand, it simply has not been growing 
fast enough recently to make significant progre ss in bringing down unemployment.  At 
8.1 percent, the unemployment rate is nearly unchanged since the be ginning of the year 
and is well above normal levels.  While unemployment has been stubbornly high, our economy has enjoyed broad price stability for some time, and we expect inflation to 
remain low for the foreseeable future.  So the case seemed clear to most of my colleagues that we could do more to assist econo mic growth and the job market without 
compromising our goal of price stability. 
Specifically, what did we do?  On secu rities purchases, we announced that we 
would buy mortgage-backed securities gua ranteed by the government-sponsored 
enterprises at a rate of $40 billion pe r month.  Those purchases, along with the 
continuation of a previous program involving Treasury securities, mean we are buying 
$85 billion of longer-term securities per mont h through the end of th e year.  We expect 
these purchases to put further downward pressu re on longer-term intere st rates, including 
mortgage rates.  To underline the Federa l Reserve’s commitment to fostering a 
sustainable economic recovery, we said that we would continue secu rities purchases and 
employ other policy tools until the outlook for the job market improves substantially in a context of price stability.  - 6 -
In the category of communications policy, we also extended our estimate of how 
long we expect to keep the short-term interest  rate at exceptionally lo w levels to at least 
mid-2015.  That doesn’t mean that we e xpect the economy to be weak through 2015.  
Rather, our message was that, so long as price stability is preserved, we will take care not 
to raise rates prematurely.  Specifically, we expect that a highly accommodative stance of 
monetary policy will remain appropriate fo r a considerable time after the economy 
strengthens.  We hope that, by clarifying our  expectations about future policy, we can 
provide individuals, families, businesses, and financial mark ets greater confidence about 
the Federal Reserve’s commitment to promo ting a sustainable rec overy and that, as a 
result, they will become more w illing to invest, hire and spend. 
Now, as I have said many times, monetary policy is no panacea.  It can be used to 
support stronger economic growth in situations  in which, as today, the economy is not 
making full use of its resources, and it can fo ster a healthier economy in the longer term 
by maintaining low and stable inflation.  Ho wever, many other steps could be taken to 
strengthen our economy over time, such as  putting the federal budget on a sustainable 
path, reforming the tax code, improving our educational system, s upporting technological 
innovation, and expanding international trade.  Although monetary policy cannot cure the 
economy’s ills, particularly in today’s chal lenging circumstances, we do think it can 
provide meaningful help.  So we at the Fe deral Reserve are going to do what we can do 
and trust that others, in both the public and pr ivate sectors, will do what they can as well. 
 
      - 7 -
What’s the Relationship between Monetary Policy and Fiscal Policy? 
 
 That brings me to the second question:  What’s the relationship between monetary 
policy and fiscal policy?  To answer this que stion, it may help to begin with the more 
basic question of how monetary  and fiscal policy differ.  
In short, monetary policy and fiscal polic y involve quite differe nt sets of actors, 
decisions, and tools.  Fiscal policy involve s decisions about how much the government 
should spend, how much it should tax, and how much it should borrow.  At the federal level, those decisions are made by the Admi nistration and the Congr ess.  Fiscal policy 
determines the size of the federal budget defi cit, which is the difference between federal 
spending and revenues in a year.  Borrowing to finance budget deficits increases the 
government’s total outstanding debt. 
As I have discussed, monetary policy is th e responsibility of the Federal Reserve--
or, more specifically, the Federal Open Ma rket Committee, which includes members of 
the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors a nd presidents of Federal Reserve Banks.  
Unlike fiscal policy, monetary policy does not involve any taxation, tr ansfer payments, or 
purchases of goods and services.  Instead, as I mentioned, monetary policy mainly 
involves the purchase and sale of  securities.  The securities that the Fed purchases in the 
conduct of monetary policy are he ld in our portfolio and earn interest.  The great bulk of 
these interest earnings is sent to the Tr easury, thereby helping reduce the government 
deficit.  In the past three years, the Fed remitted $200 billion to the federal government.  
Ultimately, the securities held by the Fed will matu re or will be sold back into the market.  
So the odds are high that the purchase programs that the Fed has undertaken in support of 
the recovery will end up reducing, not incr easing, the federal debt, both through the  - 8 -
interest earnings we send the Treasury and because a stronger economy tends to lead to 
higher tax revenues and reduced government spending (on unemployment benefits, for 
example).  Even though our activities are likely to re sult in a lower national debt over the 
long term, I sometimes hear the complaint that the Federal Reserve is enabling bad fiscal 
policy by keeping interest rate s very low and thereby making it cheaper for the federal 
government to borrow.  I find this argument unpersuasive.  The responsibility for fiscal 
policy lies squarely with the Administration and the Congress.   At the Federal Reserve, 
we implement policy to promote maximum em ployment and price stability, as the law 
under which we operate requires.  Using moneta ry policy to try to influence the political 
debate on the budget would be highly inappropr iate.  For what it’s worth, I think the 
strategy would also likely be ineffective:  Suppose, notwithstanding our legal mandate, 
the Federal Reserve were to raise interest  rates for the purpose of making it more 
expensive for the government to borrow.  Such  an action would substantially increase the 
deficit, not only because of higher interest rates, but also because the weaker recovery 
that would result from premature monetary  tightening would fu rther widen the gap 
between spending and revenues.  Would such a step lead to better fiscal outcomes?  It 
seems likely that a significant widening of th e deficit--which would make the needed 
fiscal actions even more difficult and painful--would worsen rather than improve the prospects for a comprehensive fiscal solution.  I certainly don’t underestimat e the challenges that fiscal policymakers face.  They 
must find ways to put the federal budget on a su stainable path, but not so abruptly as to 
endanger the economic recovery in the near term.  In particular, the Congress and the  - 9 -
Administration will soon have to address the so-called fiscal cliff, a combination of 
sharply higher taxes and reduced spending that  is set to happen at the beginning of the 
year.  According to the Congre ssional Budget Office and virtuall y all other experts, if that 
were allowed to occur, it would likely throw the economy back into recession.  The 
Congress and the Administration will also have  to raise the debt ceiling to prevent the 
Treasury from defaulting on its obligations, an outcome that would have extremely negative consequences for the country for year s to come.  Achieving these fiscal goals 
would be even more difficult if monetary  policy were not helping support the economic 
recovery. 
What Is the Risk that the Federal Re serve’s Monetary Policy Will Lead to 
Inflation?  
 A third question, and an important one , is whether the Federal Reserve’s 
monetary policy will lead to higher inflation down the road.  In response, I will start by 
pointing out that the Federal Reserve’s price st ability record is excellent, and we are fully 
committed to maintaining it.  Inflation has averaged close to 2 percent per year for 
several decades, and that’s about where it is today.  In particular, the low interest rate 
policies the Fed has been following for about five years now have not led to increased 
inflation.  Moreover, according to a variety of measures, th e public’s expectations of 
inflation over the long run rema in quite stable within the range that they have been for 
many years.  
With monetary policy being so accommodative now, though, it is not 
unreasonable to ask whether we are sowing the seeds of future inflation.  A related question I sometimes hear--which bears also  on the relationship between monetary and 
fiscal policy, is this:  By buying securiti es, are you “monetizing the debt”--printing  - 10 -
money for the government to use--and will that inevitably lead to higher inflation?  No, 
that’s not what is happening, and that will not happen.  Monetizing the debt means using 
money creation as a permanent source of fina ncing for government spending.  In contrast, 
we are acquiring Treasury securities on the open market and only on a temporary basis, 
with the goal of supporting the economic recove ry through lower interest rates.  At the 
appropriate time, the Federal Reserve will gra dually sell these securities or let them 
mature, as needed, to return its balance shee t to a more normal size.  Moreover, the way 
the Fed finances its securities purchases is by creating reserves in the banking system.  
Increased bank reserves held at the Fed don’t necessarily translate into more money or 
cash in circulation, and, indeed, broad measur es of the supply of money have not grown 
especially quickly, on balance, over the past few years.  
For controlling inflation, the key questi on is whether the Federal Reserve has the 
policy tools to tighten monetary conditions at  the appropriate time so as to prevent the 
emergence of inflationary pressures down th e road.  I’m confident that we have the 
necessary tools to withdraw policy accommodation when needed, and that we can do so 
in a way that allows us to shrink our balan ce sheet in a deliberate and orderly way.  For 
example, the Fed can tighten policy, even if our balance sheet remains large, by 
increasing the interest rate we pay banks on reserve balances they deposit at the Fed.  
Because banks will not lend at rates lower than  what they can earn at the Fed, such an 
action should serve to raise ra tes and tighten credit conditions more generally, preventing 
any tendency toward overheating in the economy. 
Of course, having effective tools is one th ing; using them in a timely way, neither 
too early nor too late, is another.  Determin ing precisely the right time to “take away the  - 11 -
punch bowl” is always a challenge for central bankers, but that is tr ue whether they are 
using traditional or nontraditi onal policy tools.  I can assure  you that my colleagues and I 
will carefully consider how best to foster both of our mandated objectives, maximum employment and price stability, when the time comes to make these decisions. 
How Does the Fed’s Monetary Policy Affect Savers and Investors? 
 
 The concern about possible inflation is a concern about the future.  One concern 
in the here and now is about the effect of lo w interest rates on savers  and investors.  My 
colleagues and I know that peopl e who rely on investments that  pay a fixed interest rate, 
such as certificates of deposit, are receiving ve ry low returns, a situ ation that has involved 
significant hardship for some. 
However, I would encourage you to rememb er that the current low levels of 
interest rates, while in the first instance a reflection of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy, are in a larger sense the result of the recent financial crisis, the worst shock to this 
nation’s financial system since the 1930s.  In terest rates are low throughout the developed 
world, except in countries experiencing fi scal crises, as central banks and other 
policymakers try to cope with continuing fi nancial strains and weak economic conditions. 
A second observation is that savers often wear many economic hats.  Many savers 
are also homeowners; indeed, a family’s home ma y be its most important financial asset.  
Many savers are working, or would like to be.  Some savers own businesses, and--through pension funds and 401(k) accounts--they often own stocks and other assets.  The 
crisis and recession have led to very low intere st rates, it is true, but these events have 
also destroyed jobs, hamstrung economic growth, and led to sharp declines in the values 
of many homes and businesses.  What can be  done to address all of these concerns  - 12 -
simultaneously?  The best and most comprehensive solution is to find ways to a stronger 
economy.  Only a strong economy can create higher asset values and sustainably good 
returns for savers.  And only a strong econom y will allow people who need jobs to find 
them.  Without a job, it is difficult to save for retirement or to buy a home or to pay for an 
education, irrespective of the curre nt level of in terest rates. 
The way for the Fed to support a return to a strong economy is by maintaining 
monetary accommodation, which requires low intere st rates for a time.  If, in contrast, the 
Fed were to raise rates now, before the economic recovery is fully entrenched, house 
prices might resume declines, the values of businesses large and small would drop, and, 
critically, unemployment would likely star t to rise again.  Such outcomes would 
ultimately not be good for savers or anyone else.  
How Is the Federal Reserve Held Accountable in a Democratic Society? 
 
 I will turn, finally, to the question of how  the Federal Reserve is held accountable 
in a democratic society.  
The Federal Reserve was created by the C ongress, now almost a century ago.  In 
the Federal Reserve Act and subsequent legi slation, the Congress laid out the central 
bank’s goals and powers, and the Fed is re sponsible to the Congress for meeting its 
mandated objectives, including fostering maxi mum employment and price stability.  At 
the same time, the Congress wisely designed the Federal Reserve to be insulated from 
short-term political pressures.  For exampl e, members of the Federal Reserve Board are 
appointed to staggered, 14-year terms, with  the result that some members may serve 
through several Administrations.  Research and practical experience ha ve established that 
freeing the central bank from short-term political pressures leads to better monetary  - 13 -
policy because it allows policymakers to focu s on what is best for the economy in the 
longer run, independently of near-term elector al or partisan con cerns.  All of the 
members of the Federal Open Market Committee take this principle very seriously and strive always to make monetary policy d ecisions based solely on factual evidence and 
careful analysis.  
It is important to keep politics out of m onetary policy decisions, but it is equally 
important, in a democracy, for those decisions --and, indeed, all of the Federal Reserve’s 
decisions and actions--to be undertaken in  a strong framework of accountability and 
transparency.  The American people have a right to know how the Federal Reserve is 
carrying out its responsibili ties and how we are using taxpayer resources.   
One of my principal objectives as Chairm an has been to make monetary policy at 
the Federal Reserve as transparent as possibl e.  We promote policy transparency in many 
ways.  For example, the Federal Open Market Committee explains the reasons for its 
policy decisions in a statement released after each regularly  scheduled meeting, and three 
weeks later we publish minutes with a detaile d summary of the meeting discussion.  The 
Committee also publishes quarterly economic pr ojections with information about where 
we anticipate both policy and the economy will be  headed over the next several years.  I 
hold news conferences four times a year  and testify often before congressional 
committees, including twice-yearly appearances that are specifically designated for the 
purpose of my presenting a comprehensive mone tary policy report to the Congress.  My 
colleagues and I frequently deliver speeches, such  as this one, in towns and cities across 
the country.    - 14 -
The Federal Reserve is also very open a bout its finances and operations.  The 
Federal Reserve Act requires the Federal Rese rve to report annually  on its operations and 
to publish its balance sheet weekly.  Simila rly, under the financia l reform law enacted 
after the financial crisis, we publicly report in detail on ou r lending programs and 
securities purchases, includi ng the identities of borrowers  and counterparties, amounts 
lent or purchased, and other information, su ch as collateral accepted.  In late 2010, we 
posted detailed information on our public website about more than 21,000 individual 
credit and other transactions conducted to st abilize markets during th e financial crisis.  
And, just last Friday, we posted the first in an ongoing series of quarterly reports 
providing a great deal of information on indi vidual discount window loans and securities 
transactions.  The Federal Reserve’s financ ial statement is audited by an independent, 
outside accounting firm, and an independent Inspector General has wide powers to 
review actions taken by the Board.  Importa ntly, the Government Accountability Office 
(GAO) has the ability to--and does--oversee th e efficiency and integrity of all of our 
operations, including our financial controls and governance.    
While the GAO has access to all aspects of the Fed’s operations and is free to 
criticize or make recommendations, there is one important exception:  monetary 
policymaking.  In the 1970s, the Congress deliberately excluded monetary policy 
deliberations, decisions, and actions from the scope of GAO reviews.  In doing so, the 
Congress carefully balanced the need for democratic accountabili ty with the benefits that 
flow from keeping monetary policy free from short-term political pressures. 
However, there have been recent propos als to expand the authority of the GAO 
over the Federal Reserve to include reviews of  monetary policy decisions.  Because the  - 15 -
GAO is the investigative arm of the Congre ss and GAO reviews may be initiated at the 
request of members of the Congress, these reviews (or the prospect of reviews) of 
individual policy decisions coul d be seen, with good reason, as  efforts to bring political 
pressure to bear on monetary policymakers.   A perceived politicization of monetary 
policy would reduce public conf idence in the ability of the Federal Reserve to make its 
policy decisions based strictly on what is  good for the economy in the longer term.  
Balancing the need for accountability agains t the goal of insulating monetary policy from 
short-term political pressure is very importa nt, and I believe that the Congress had it right 
in the 1970s when it explicitly chose to protect monetary policy decisionmaking from the 
possibility of politically  motivated reviews. 
Conclusion 
 
In conclusion, I will simply note that th ese past few years have been a difficult 
time for the nation and the economy.  For its part, the Federal Reserve has also been 
tested by unprecedented challenges.  As we a pproach next year’s 100th anniversary of the 
signing of the Federal Reserve Act, however, I have great confidence in the institution.  
In particular, I would like to  recognize the skill,  professionalism, and dedication of the 
employees of the Federal Reserve System.  They work tirelessly to serve the public 
interest and to promote prosperity for peopl e and businesses across America.  The Fed’s 
policy choices can always be debated, but the quality and commitment of the Federal Reserve as a public institution is seco nd to none, and I am proud to lead it. 
 Now that I’ve answered questions that I’ve posed to myself, I’d be happy to 
respond to yours.

Brief Welcoming Remarks by  
 
Ben S. Bernanke  
 
Chairman  
 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  
 
at 
 
“Community Banking in the 21st Century”  
 
a Conference Co -sponsor ed by  
the Federal Reserve System  and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors  
 
St. Louis, Missouri  
 
 
 
    
October  2, 2013  
  
I woul d like to w elcome everyone  to the inaugural Community Banking Research 
and Policy Conference, co- sponsored by the Federal Reserve System and the Conference 
of State Bank Supervisors  (CSBS) .  I particularly want to thank the Federal Reserve and 
CSBS staff members who worked hard to organize this event.  By bringing together 
community bankers, bank regulators, and r esearchers from academic institutions and 
government agencies, the conference will help us all to better understand the issues that are most important to the future of community banking.  You may have noticed that I referred to this as the “inaugural” conf erence.  Although firm plans have not yet been 
made, I do hope this will be the first of many joint Federal Reserve System and CSBS conferences that focus on community banking research and policy.  
The U.S. banking system has undergone significant consolida tion over the past 
two decades or so, with very large banking organizations increasing their market shares.  
Nevertheless, community banks (which we typically define as banking institutions with assets of $10 billion or less) continue to provide vital fina ncial services to households, 
small businesses, and small farms in communities across America.    
Community banking is fundamentally a local, relationship- based business.  
Community bankers live in the localities they serve; their customers are their neighb ors 
and friends.  Their direct, personal knowledge of the local economy enables them to tailor products and services to meet their communities’ needs.  They can look beyond credit scores and other model -based metrics  to mak e lending decisions in part based on more 
qualitative information that large regional or national financial institutions are less well suited to consider.  Community bankers recognize that their own success depends on the health of the communities they serve, which is why so many communit y bankers  - 2 - 
contribute locally as citizens and leaders as well as in their capacities as lenders and 
providers of financial services.  The photos that you see around the conference center do a very nice job of capturing the spirit of community banking and il lustrating the 
contributions of community bankers.  
Although community banks have some natural advantages, such as local 
knowledge and relationships, they also face significant challenges.  As battle -scarred 
survivors of a financial crisis and deep recessi on, community bankers today confront a 
frustratingly slow recovery, stiff competition from larger banks and other financial institutions, and the responsibility of complying with  new and existing regulations.  Some  
observers  have worried  that these obstacl es--particularly complying with 
regulation s--may prove insurmountable.  My colleagues at the Federal Reserve and I 
understand these concerns, and we are committed to crafting supervisory policies and regulations that are appropriately scaled to banks’ size and complexity.  And we have 
confidence that the remarkable resilience of America’s community bankers will enable 
them not only to survive, but also to thrive in the years ahead.  
The best way to understand the challenges  that community bankers face is to  talk 
to the  bankers themselves , and we at the Federal Reserve do that regularly.  For example, 
to ensure that we remain mindful of the unique characteristics of community banks, the Federal Reserve Board established the Community Depository Institutions A dvisory 
Council.  This council is composed of representatives of community banks, thrifts, and credit unions from each of the 12 Federal Rese rve Districts.  Members of the c ouncil 
meet with the Board twice a year, bringing to us the views and concerns of t heir  - 3 - 
colleagues back home.  Our meetings with the c ouncil have been extremely informative 
and have improved our ability to understand and respond to community bank concerns.  
Of course, understanding those concerns is of limited value unless we use what 
we have learned in the process of rulemaking.  To make that connection, we also 
established a subcommittee of the Board that reviews all regulatory and supervisory proposals for their potential effects on community banks.  The subcommittee also has worked tow ard communicat ing more effectively  with the industry regarding the extent to 
which new rules and guidance do, or do not, apply to community banks.  I hope those efforts are helping community bankers avoid spending time trying to understand rules that do not apply to them.   
One of the strengths of the Federal Reserve System is the quality of the research 
done by our economists and other professionals.  The research we do on community banking helps guide our thinking on regulatory matters and on broader econ omic trends.  
In particular, the Board’s subcommittee on community banking is regularly briefed on relevant research being conducted across the System.  Thus, research findings inform policy, and policy concerns guide research.  In fact, after learning about several research projects, the subcommittee suggested that the staff hold a community banking research conference-- a suggestion that brought all of us to St. Louis today.   
The range of topics that will be covered over the next day  and a half is 
impress ive.  The first research session this afternoon will focus on the role of community 
banks in our financial and economic system.  Papers in this session examine whether community banks influence new -firm survival , whether equipment finance is a potential 
growth area for community banks , how community bank failures affect local economic  - 4 - 
performance, and whether community bank lending  relationships in rural areas are 
fundamentally different from those in urban areas.  
Two research sessions are scheduled for tomorrow morning.  The first will 
consider community bank performance, with papers looking at the effect of financial 
derivatives on community bank profitability , the characteristics of community banks that 
recovered from significant financial distress , the effect of distance between merging 
banks on postmerger  performance, and the determinants of differences in profitability 
across community banks.  The second session will consider issues of bank supervision and regulation, with papers discussing variations in the stringency of bank examination standards over time and their effect on lending , the effects of the Dodd -Frank Act on 
community banks , the relationship between community bank capital ratios and the 
likelihood of failure , and an approach for rationa lizing bank supervision and regulation. 
As you can see, the papers at this conference cover a variety of important topics, 
and I expect they will provoke spirited discussions among the many experts in attendance.  I must say that I am encouraged to see so many researchers from a wide range of academic and government institutions working on issues of great interest to both community bankers and their regulators.   
To close the conference, CSBS Chairman Charles Vice will present a report 
summarizing information gathered from more than 1,500 community bankers attending 
town hall sessions across the country over the past several months.  In addition, a panel of community bankers will share their own views on the state of community banking and prospects for the f uture.  
Thank you for being here.  I wish you an enjoyable and productive conference.  ",2013-10-02,bernanke

Community Bank Access to Innovation  
Re
marks by  
Michelle W. Bowman  
Member  
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  
at the 
Government Relations Council (GRC) meeting  
sponsored by 
The American Bankers Association  
Washington, D.C.  
(virtual conference)  
S
eptember 9, 2021Introduction 
  Thank you to the American Bankers Association for inviting me to address this 
year’s Government Relations Council  meeting .  Although we had all hoped that this 
meeting would be in person, we will have to settle for the opportunity to conven e 
virtually once  again.  As we do so, I c ontinue to reflect on the way t he pandemic has 
transformed businesses and sectors of the economy, much as it has changed life for all of 
us.  Unfortunately, some a spects of the way we live and interact may  be significantly 
altered for some time .  But focusing on today, I will share some of my perspectives about 
the impact of the pandemic on the community bank sector  and the potential of technology  
to help meet the challenges of this  new environment.  
The f inancial services industry has experienced  rapid technological change over 
the past few years, and there  is no sign  that th is change will slow any time soon.  
Innovative technologies were already driving  greater efficiency  and creating 
opportunities  for banks  and their customers before the onset of the pandemic.  In the past 
year and a half, these trends have accelerated,  and I expect th is level of performance to 
establish a new threshold of industry expectation.  Let’s look at education as another 
example of an industry that has been transformed.   We saw schools throughout the 
country quickly leverage technology to shift to  online learning  last year .  Schools 
implemented innovative technology solutions to continue curriculum, and to creatively  
engage students and build virtual student -teacher  relationships .  While the implications of 
a period of prolonged online learning are not yet clear, technology enabled the  expansion 
of the range of learning alternatives and essentially prevented the American education 
system from grinding to a halt .  Some of these new tools  will likely continue to be used even as in-person instruction return ed this fall.  We are seeing service providers  in a 
variety of industries leverage technology to engage with their customers —from 
education , to retail shopping , to fitness training and beyond. 
In the banking industry, t echnology continues to encourage new ways of 
interacting with and serving customers that can help banks  meet  the needs and 
preferences  of their customers and communities .  Such innovation creates important 
opportunities for banks of all sizes and business models .  As regulators, it is  also 
important that we monitor how banks  are adapting and evolving in response  to these 
changes , and that we offer insights and clear expectations to help banks manage 
associated challenges .  
Broad Innovation Considerations  
Community banks continue to play a vital role in supporting local communities . 
Their ability to thrive in an increasingly digital landscape is critical to  the economic well -
being of those communities .  Through my regular engagement  with community bank 
leaders , I do see innovation thriving .  When banks  can be agile in developing 
relationships with third -party providers to meet unique customer needs , they  can find 
their own paths to innovation.  For example, community banks approach  the evolving 
payment needs of tech savvy  customers  from many different angles .  Their  solutions 
include partnering with financial technology (or fintech ) companie s, developing peer -to-
peer payment solutions with their core providers, and even hiring outsi de developers to 
create their own apps that will best serve customers’  needs . 
While positive trends in community bank innovation are encouraging, I am also 
attuned to the challenges community banks face when seeking to innovate .  I have heard from many community bankers about the constraints they face in taking advantage of 
new technologi es—both in terms of the resources and the expertise required to adopt 
innovative technologies in a responsible manner.  The cost of conducting due  diligence 
on prospective partners can be high for community banks already facing capacity 
constraints .  Seeking a partnership with a newly established  fintech  company may 
introduce additional complications .  For example, a less experienced  partner may  be able 
to offer a product that fits a community bank’s needs but may  not understand  the bank’s 
regulatory obligations or have fully developed operational or compliance frameworks .  
Gaps in the ability to demonstrate or guarantee compliance  can introduce risk that a 
community bank will need to  fully understand and ultimately to manage. 
In December 2020, I spoke about several initiatives being pursued by the Federal 
Reserve targeted at promoting access to innovation for community banks and overcoming 
related challenges .  Today I am happy to provide updates and announcements about those 
initiatives .  I hope that each  provide s additional clarity and serve s as a valuable resource 
to community banks as they pursue their own innovation strategies . 
Community Bank/Fintech Partnership Paper  
The first initiative  is the publication of a paper highlighting  some of the promising 
ways that community banks are partnering with fintech companies .  It lays out some 
important issues that banks must consider  to maximize the effectiveness of the 
partnership.   This paper is the product of an extensive outreach effort  with community 
banks, fintechs, and industry stakeholders .  It involved discussions focused on the 
strategic and tactical decisions that support effective partnerships  in a responsible 
manner . Community banks engage in a range of partnerships with fintechs, each pursued 
for different reasons, with varying levels of investment of time and resources .  The paper  
describes  key partnership types and the associated benefits, risks, and challenges that  
community banks experience with each type.  The paper also identifies fundamental 
considerations for effective partnerships as described by  community bankers .  
Some  valuable insights emerged from our outreach , which  may benefit  
community banks at various stages of the innovation process .  Two important themes 
stood out: the first is establishing  trust and aligning with fintech partners, and second, 
building  a long-term culture committed  to innovation.  Let me elaborate on each  of these 
themes . 
In our outreach, bankers noted that it is critical for  partnerships to be  built upon a 
foundation of mutual trust and alignment  of values .  In some cases, due diligence  efforts 
reveal that potential partners do not share the banks’ values  or objectives .  One bank, for 
example, began discussions with a fintech company that could assist it with the bank’s 
Paycheck  Protection Program loan originations  by providing a customer -facing 
application portal .  After learning that this partner intended to sell the small business 
customer information it would obtain, the bank opted out of the partnership .  Instead, the 
bank looked to other fintech partners with values more closely aligned with its own.  
Harnessing  the full potential of technolog y innovation  also requires a long -term, 
strategic commitment to innovation .  Many bankers spoke of the importance of knowing 
exactly what new technology is solving for, building a team they trust, and securing buy-
in from both senior management and the staff  responsible for implementation .  Bankers 
who have forged successful partnerships don’t innovate for the sake of being innovative but instead have a clear vision of their goals .  For example, one bank partnered with a 
fintech company to roll out limited banking services to teenagers .  Its intention was to 
promote financial literacy among young people in the  community  and to prepare the bank  
to accommodate the preferences of a new generation .  The bank also hired local college 
students to work with staff, combining the technological expertise of these more recent 
hires  with the deep compliance background of the bank’s long -standing employees .  
Interagency Fintech Due Diligence Guide  
In addition to the paper , the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the 
Currency (OCC), and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) have recently 
published a vendor due diligence guide to assist community banks with their risk 
assessment when considering a new relationship with a fintech.  I have often heard from 
community bankers  that the manpower and other costs related to due dilig ence are 
formidable barrier s for banks seeking to establish new third-party relationships .  A recent 
survey of community banks confirms t hat burdens  related to due diligence are indeed an 
impediment to new third -party relationships, including those with fintechs.1  This guide 
was developed to help  reduce these burdens  by providing a practical resource for 
community banks when assessing the risks of potential fintech partnerships . 
This optional  and customizable resource does not establish new regulatory 
expectations  but it can serve as a starting point for banks in their due diligence process .  
A community bank can tailor how it uses the guide to meet its unique  circumstances and 
the specific  risk-management needs  posed by each fintech relationship .  A community 
bank can also share the guide with potential partners to help them understand the bank’s 
1 Conference of State Bank Supervisors , 2020 CSBS National Survey of Community Banks , 2020 Research and 
Policy Conference,  https://www.csbs.org/system/files/2020 -09/cb21publication_2020.pdf . risk-management requirements .  Specifically, the guide contains relevant considerations , 
sources of information, and illustrative examples within six key areas of due diligence .  
These include, but, of course,  are not limited to, business experience and qualifications, 
financial condition, and legal and regulatory compliance .  I hope this guide will 
encourage responsible innovation that takes into account the range of potential risks of a 
partnership in addition to its potential benefits.   
Request for C omment on Interagency Third-Party  Risk Management G uidance  
While the Federal Reserve will continue to focus on developing resources for the 
community bank sector, it  is also important to ensure that guidance is up to date , it 
supports the evolving range of partnerships,  and it is consistent across all banking 
agencies .  In July, the Federal Reserve, the OCC , and the FDIC published for comment  
proposed guidance for banks  managing the risks of third -party relationships , including 
those with fintechs .  This guidance should reduce unnecessary burden by eliminating  
variation in supervisory views .  It is  also my hope that this guidance will better address 
the landscape of the third -party relationships that exist today .  I am particularly interested 
in hearing from a wide range of community banks on whether the guidance is clear, 
helpful, and appropriately calibrated to address the risks  associated with these 
arrangements . 
Use of Artificial Intelligence  
The final  topic for  my remarks  today is the use of a rtificial intelligence  (AI).  
Through clear, consistent supervisory guidance combined with  useful  tools and resources , 
supervisors can continue to support community banks in their efforts to navigat e an 
increasing ly complex world .  In pursuit of this goal , in March of this year , the agencies published a request for information on financial institutions’ use of artificial intelligence .  
As part of this request for information, the agencies sought details  about banks’ 
challenges in developing, adopting, and using this technology, including those challenges 
related to third -party services.   
While we are still reviewing and processing the feedback, initial reactions from 
Federal Reserve staff indicate that these responses are very helpful in our  consider ation 
of next steps.   So, I would like  to thank those who provided comments in response to the 
agencies’ request, especially those pertaining to the use of artificial intelligence  by 
community banks .  Comment letters confirmed our understanding that at times 
community banks choose to engage with fintech partners and their models to tap into the 
benefits of AI .  We have also heard loud and clear that acting on an interagency basis to 
ensure regulatory consistenc y is very important.   As we consider the information 
collected and the potential next steps, I will encourage Federal Reserve staff to continue 
exploring opportunities to provide supervisory clarity on this topic and more generally to 
consider ways to help community banks innovate in the application of new technologies.    
Conclusion 
In conclusion, I welcome comments and feedback not only on the resources the 
Federal Reserve and other  agencies have published recently but also regarding additional 
resources that may be helpful for community banks as they continue to pursue access to innovation.  And in the coming weeks, I look forward to participating in two upcoming  
innovation-focused programs oriented toward community banks .  The Federal Reserve 
will host an “ Ask the Fed ” program later this fall focused on community banks and service providers , and the Board and the Kansas City Reserve Bank will jointly host an 
Innovation Office Hours event later this month .  
Frequent and continued engagement with bankers, fintechs, and other third parties 
has demonstrated the nuance, complexity, and many considerations involved in 
promoting community bank access to innovation.  It is my sincere intention that the 
community bank/fintech partnership paper, the vendor due diligence guide, and proposed 
third -party , risk-management guidance serve as  a foundation upon which the Federal 
Reserve will continue to build.  ",2021-09-09,bowman

Long -Term Interest Rates  
 
 
 
Remarks by  
 
Ben S. Bernanke  
 
Chairman  
 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  
 
at the 
 
Annual Monetary/Macroeconomics Conference:  The Past and  Future of Monetary Policy  
 
Sponsored by Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco  
 
San Francisco, California  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
March 1 , 2013 
  
I will begin my remarks by posing a question:  Why are long -term interest rates so 
low in the United States and in other major industrial countries?   
At first blush, t he answer seems obvious:  C entral banks in those  countries are 
pursuing accommodative monetary policies to boost growth and reduce slack in their 
economies.  However, while central banks  certainly  play a key role in determining the 
behavior of long -term interest rates, theirs is only a proximate influence.  A more 
complete explanation of the current low level of rates must take account of the  broader 
economic environment in which central banks are currently operating and of the 
constraints that that environment places on their policy choices.  
Let me start with a brief overview of the recent history of long -term interest rates 
in some  key econo mies .  Chart 1 shows the 10 -year government bond yields for five 
major industrial countries :  Canada, Germany, Japan, the United Ki ngdom, and the 
United States.  Note that t he movements in these yields are quite correlated despite some 
differences in the e conomic circumstances and central bank mandates in those  countries.  
Further, with the notable exception of Japan, the levels  of the yields have been very 
similar --indeed,  strikingly so, with long -term yields declining over time and currently 
close to 2 pe rcent in each case.  The similar behavior of these yields attests to the global 
nature of the economic and financial developments  of recent years, as well as to the  broad 
similar ity in how the  monetary policymakers  in the advanced economies  have responded 
to these developments.  Of course, Japanese yields are clearly a case apart, as Japan has 
endured an extended period of deflation, while inflation in the other four countries has 
been positive and generally close to the stated objectives of the monetary aut horities.  But  - 2 - 
even Japanese yields have shown some tendency  to fluctuate along with other benchmark 
yields, and they have also declined over the period shown.   
In my comments, I will delve more deeply into the reasons why these long -term 
interest rates h ave fallen so low.  This examination may be useful both for understanding 
the current stance of policy and also for thinking about  how rates may evolve.  In short, 
we expect that as the economy recovers , long-term rates will rise over t ime to more 
normal l evels.  A  return to more normal conditions in financial markets would, of course, 
be most welcome.  Many commentators have noted, however, that both an extended 
period of low rates and the transition back toward normal levels may pose risks to 
financial st ability.  In the final portion of my remarks , I will discuss  some aspects of  how 
the Federal Reserve is approaching these risks.  
Why Are Long -Term Interest Rates So Low?  
So, why are long -term interest rates currently so low?   To help answer this 
question , it is useful to decompose longer -term yields into three components:  one 
reflecting expected inflation over the term of the security; another  capturing the expected 
path of short -term real, or inflation -adjusted, interest rates; and a residual component 
known as the term premium.  Of course, none of these three components is observed 
directly, but there are standard ways of estimating them.  Chart 2 displays one version of 
this decomposition of the 10 -year U.S. Treasury yield based on a term structure model  
developed by Federal Reserve staff.1  The broad features I will emphasize are similar to 
those found by other authors using a variety of methods.2   
                                                 
1 Estimates are based on the model of D ’Amico, Kim , and Wei (2010).  That model employs the “arbitrage -
free” term structure framework and jointly models real yields, nominal yields , and inflation as functions of 
four underlying latent factors.  Historical data on nominal yields, real yields, an d inflation can be used to 
estimate these underlying factors and the relationship of real and nominal yields to the factors.  Based on  - 3 - 
All three components of the 10 -year yield have declined since 2007.  The 
decomposition attributes much of the decline in the yield since 2010 to a sharp fall in the 
term premium, but the expected short -term real rate component also moved down 
significantly .  Let’s consider each component more closely.  
The expected inflation component has drifted  gradually downward for many years 
and has become quite stable.  In large part, the downward trend and stabilization of 
expected inflation in the United States are products of the increasing credibility of the 
Federal Reserve’s commitment to price stability.  In January 2012, the Federal Open 
Market Committee (FOMC) underscored this commitment by issuing a statement --since 
reaffirmed at its January 2013 meeting --on its longer -run goals and policy strategy, which 
included a longer -run inflation target of 2 percent.3  The anchoring of long -term inflation 
expectations near 2 percent has been a key factor influencing long -term interest rates over 
recent years.  It almost certainly helped mitigate the strong disinflationary pressures 
immediately following the crisis.  While I have not shown expected inflation for other 
advanced economies, the pictures would be very similar --again , except  for Japan.  
With the expected inflat ion component of the 10 -year rate near 2 percent and the 
rate itself a bit below 2 percent recently, it is clear that the combination of the other two 
components --the expected path of short -term real interest rates and the term premium --
must make a small n et negative contribution.  
                                                                                                                                                 
this information, the model can be used to produce estimates of the components of nominal yields shown in 
chart 2 .  Note that i nflation in chart 2 is measured by the consumer price index ; inflation measured by this 
index is close to but on average slightly higher than inflation as measured by the price index for personal 
consumption expenditure s, the measure to which the Fed eral Open Market Committee ’s 2 percent inflation 
objective refers.

Financial Forecasts  gives  broadly similar results , as do many standard term structure  models.

The expected path of short -term real interest rates is, of course, influenced by 
monetary policy, both the current stance of policy and market participants’ expectations 
of how policy will evolve.  The stance of monetary policy at  any given time, in turn, is 
driven largely by the economic outlook, the risks surrounding that outlook, and at times 
other factors, such as whether the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates is binding.  
In the current environment, both policymakers a nd market participants widely agree that 
supporting the U.S. economic recovery while keeping inflation close to 2 percent will 
likely require real short -term rates, currently negative, to remain low for some time.  As 
shown in chart 2, the expected average  of the short -term real rate over the next 10 years 
has gradually declined to near zero over the past few years, in part reflecting downward 
revisions in expectations about the pace of the ongoing recovery and , hence, a pushing 
out of expectations regardin g how long nominal short -term rates will remain low. 4  
As the persistence of the effects of the crisis have become clearer, the Federal 
Reserve’s communications have reinforced the expectation that conditions are likely to 
warrant highly accommodative pol icy for some time:  Most recently, the FOMC 
indicated that it expects to maintain an exceptionally low level of the federal funds rate at 
least as long as the unemployment rate is above 6.5 percent, projected inflation between 
one and two years ahead is no  more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s 2 
percent target, and long -term inflation expectations remain stable.5 
In discussing the role of monetary policy in determining the expected future path 
of real short -term rates, I have cheated a lit tle:  What monetary policy actually controls is 
                                                 
4 Real interest rates are not constrained by the zero bound, and th e fact that expected average real short -
term interest rates are near zero reflects that the nominal rate is expected, on average, to run close to the 
expected inflation rate, which is near 2 percent.  
5 See the FOMC’s December statement at Board of Governor s (2012).   - 5 - 
nominal  short -term rates.  However, because inflation adjusts slowly, control of nominal 
short -term rates usually translates into control of real short -term rates over the short and 
medium  term.  In the longe r term, real interest rates are determined primarily by 
nonmonetary factors, such as the expected return to capital investments, which in turn is 
closely related to  the underlying strength of the economy.  The fact that market yields 
currently incorporate an expectation of very low short -term real interest rates over the 
next 10  years suggests that market participants anticipate persistent ly slow  growth and , 
consequently,  low real returns  to investment .  In other words, the low level of expected 
real short rates  may reflect not only investor  expectations for a slow cyclical recovery  but 
also some downgrading of longer -term growth prospects.6 
Chart 3, which display s yields on inflation -indexed, long -term government bonds 
for the same five countries represented in chart 1, shows that expected real yields over the 
longer term are low in other advanced industrial economies as well.   Note again the 
strong similarity in r eturns across th ese economies , suggesting once again the importance 
of common global factors .  While indexed yields spiked up around the end of 2008, 
reflecting market stresses at the height of the crisis that undercut the demand for these 
bonds, these eff ects dissipated in 2009.  Since that time, inflation -indexed yields have 
declined steadily  and now stand below zero  in each country .7  Apparently,  low longer -
term real rate expectations are playing an important role in accountin g for low 10 -year 
nominal ra tes in other industrial countries , as well as in the United States.  
                                                 
6 Between April 2009 and October 2012, expectations for average growth over the next 10 years, as 
reported in Consensus Forecasts, have fallen about 0.2 percentage points for the United States.  This  
reduction in growth expectations is a broad ph enomenon:  Between April 2009 and October 2012, the 
average prediction for growth over the next 10 years for Canada, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom 
has fallen between 0.1 and 0.6  percentage points.  
7 It is important to note that these indexed yield s are likely being pushed down by term premi ums akin to 
the term premi ums in nominal rates discussed in this speech.   - 6 - 
The third and final component of the long -term interest rate is the term premium, 
defined as the residual component not captured by expected real short -term rates or 
expected inflation.  A s I noted, the largest portion of the downward move in long -term 
rates since 2010 appears to be due to a fall in the term premium, so it deserves some 
special discussion.   
In general, t he term premium is the extra return investors expect to obtain from 
holding long -term bonds as opposed to holding and rolling over a sequence of short -term 
securities over the same period.  In part, the term premium compensates bondholders for 
interest rate risk --the risk of capital gains and losses that interest rate change s imply for 
the value of longer -term bonds.  Two changes in the nature of this interest rate risk have 
probably contributed to a general downward movement of the term premium  in recent 
years.  First, t he volatility of Treasury yields has declined, in part because short -term 
rates are pressed up against the zero lower bound and are expected to remain there for 
some time to come.  Second , the correlation of bond prices and stock prices has become 
increasingly negative over time, implying that bonds have becom e more valuable as a 
hedge against risks from holding other assets.8  
 Beyond interest rate risk, a number of other factors also affect the term premium  
in practice .  For example, during periods of financial turmoil, the prices of longer -term 
Treasury secu rities are often driven up by so -called safe -haven demands of investors who 
place special value on the safety and liquidity of Treasury securities.  Indeed, even during 
more placid periods, global demands for safe assets increase  the value of Treasury 
securities.  Many foreign governments and central banks, particularly those with 
sustained current  account surpluses, hold substantial international reserves in the form of 
                                                 
8 See, for example, Campbell, Sunderam, and Viceira (2009 ).   - 7 - 
Treasur ies.  Foreign holdings of U.S. Treasury securities  currently  amount to about 
$5-1/2 trillion, roughly half of the total amount of marketable Treasury debt outstanding.  
The global economic and financial stresses of recent years --triggered first by  the financial 
crisis, and then by the problems in the euro  area--appear to have signific antly elevated the 
safe-haven demand for Treasur y securit ies at times, pushing down Treasury yields and 
implying a lower , or even a negative , term premium.9   
Federal Reserve actions have also affected term premiums in recent years, most 
prominently throug h a series of Large -Scale Asset Purchase (LSAP) programs.  These 
programs consist of open  market purchases of agency debt, agency mortgage -backed 
securities, and longer -term Treasury securities.  To the extent that Treasur y securit ies and 
agency -guaranteed  securities are not perfect substitut es for  other assets, Federal Reserve 
purchases of these assets should lower their term premiums, putting downward  pressure 
on longer -term interest rates and easing financial conditions more broadly.  Although 
estimated effects vary, a growing body of research supports the view that LSAPs are 
effective at bringing down term premiums and thus reducing longer -term rates.10  Of 
course, the Federal Reserve has used this unconventional approach to lowering longer -
term rates bec ause, with short -term rates near zero, it can no longer use its conventional 
approach of cutting the target for the federal funds rate.11  Accordingly, this portion of the 
                                                 
9 There are some additional more technical features of the Treasury market tha t push down the term 
premium.  For example, the Treasury term premium is likely also depressed by the global demand for 
Treasury securities for use as collateral or margin in funding or derivatives markets.   
10 See, for example, Gagnon, Raskin, Remache, and Sack (2011); Li and Wei (2012); Hamilton and Wu 
(2012); D’Amico, English, L ópez-Salido, and Nelson (2012); Rosa (2012); Krishnamurthy and Vissing -
Jørgensen (2011); and Hancock and Passmore (2012) . 
11 Term premiums, calculated  using similar methods , have  also declined fairly sharply recently in Canada, 
Germany, and the United Kingdom; somewhat less so in Japan.  This result is  notable  in that th e central 
banks of these economies, with the exception of the Bank of England, have not pursued large -scale 
purchases of longer -term securities.   - 8 - 
decline in the term premium might ultimately be attributed to the sluggish economic 
recovery, which prompted additional policy action from the Federal Reserve.  
Let’s recap.  Long -term interest rates are the sum of expected inflation, expected 
real short -term interest rates, and a term premium .  Expected inflation has been  low and 
stable, r eflecting central bank mandates and credibility as well as considerable resource 
slack in the major industrial economies.  Real interest rates are expected to remain low , 
reflecting the weakness of the recovery  in advanced economies  (and possibly some 
down grading of longer -term growth prospects  as well ).  This weakness, all else being 
equal, dictates that monetary policy must  remain accommodative  if it is  to support the 
recovery and reduce disinflationary risks.  Put another way, at the present time the maj or 
industrial economies apparently cannot sustain significantly higher real rates of return ; in 
that respect, central banks --so long as they are meeting their price stability mandates --
have  little choice but to take actions that keep nominal long -term rates relatively low, as 
suggested by the similarity in the levels of the rates shown in chart 1 .  Finally, term 
premiums are low or negative, reflecting a host of factors, including central ban k actions 
in support of economic recovery.  Thus, while the current constellation of long -term rates 
across many advanced countries has few precedents, it is not puzzling:  It follows 
naturally from the economic circumstances of these countries and the imp lications of  
these circumstances for the policies of their central banks.  
How Are Long -Term Rates Likely to Evolve?  
So, how are long -term rates likely to evolve over coming years?  It is worth 
pausing to note that, n ot that long ago, central bankers would have carefully avoided this 
topic.  However, i t is now a bedrock principle of central banking that transparency about  - 9 - 
the likely path of policy, in general, and interest rates , in particular , can increase the 
effectiveness of policy.  In the present contex t, I would add that transparency may 
mitigate risks emanating from unexpected rate movements.  Thus, let me turn to 
prospects for long -term rates, starting with the expected path  of rates  and then turning to 
deviations from the expected path that may arise . 
If, as the FOMC anticipates, the economic recovery continues at a moderate pace, 
with unemployment slowly declining and inflation expectations remaining near 2 percent , 
then long-term interest rates would be expected to rise gradually toward more normal 
levels over the next several years.  This  rise would occur as the market’s view of the 
expected date at which the Federal Reserve will begin the removal of policy 
accommodation draws nearer and then as accommodation is removed.   Some 
normalization of the t erm premium might also contribute to a rise in long -term rates.   
To illustrate  possible paths , chart 4 displays four different forecasts of the  
evolution of the  10-year Treasury yield over coming years.  The black line is the forecast 
reported in the Decem ber 2012 Blue  Chip Financial Forecast s survey.  The green line 
gives the Congressional Budget Office forecast published in February, and the blue line 
presents the median from the Survey of Professional Forecasters , as reported in the first 
quarter of this  year.  Finally, the purple  line shows  a forecast based on the term structure 
model used for the decomposition of the 10 -year yield in chart 2.12  While these forecasts 
embody a wide range of underlying models and assumptions, the basic message is clear --
long-term interest rates are expected to rise gradually over the next few years, rising  (at 
                                                 
12 This projection assumes that two key components of the 10-year Treasury yield shown in chart 2 --the 
expected average real short -rate and the term premium --revert to their respective mean levels over the 
period 2000 to 200 6 during the next 5 years; the expected average inflation component is assumed to 
remain constant near the 2 percent level prevailing at the end of 2012.   - 10 - 
least according to these forecasts)  to around 3 percent at the end of 2014.  The  forecasts 
in chart 4 imply  a total increase of between 200 and 300 basis points  in long-term yields  
between now and 2017.  
Of course, the forecasts in chart 4 are just forecasts, and reality might well turn 
out to be different.  Chart 5 provides three complementary approaches to summarizing 
the uncertainty surrounding forecasts of long -term rates.  The dark gray bars in the chart 
are based on the range of forecasts reported in the Blue Chip Financial Forecasts, the blue 
bars are based on the historical uncertainty regarding long -term interest rates as reflected 
in the Board staff’s FRB/US  model  of the U.S. economy , and the orange  bars give a 
market -based measure of uncertainty derived from swaptions.  These three different 
measures give a broadly similar picture about the upside and downside risks to the 
forecasts of long -term rates.  Rate s 100 basis points higher than the expected paths in 
chart 4 by 2014 are certainly plausible outcomes as judged by each of the three measures , 
and this uncertainty grows to as much as 1 75 basis points by 2017.  Note, though,  that 
while the risk of an unexp ected rise in interest rates has drawn much attention, the level 
of long -term interest rates also could prove to be lower than forecast.  Indeed, by the 
measures  shown in chart 5 , the upside and downside risks to the level of rates are roughly 
symmetric as  of 2017.  
We also have some historical experience with increases in rates during tightening 
cycles  to consider .  For example, in 1994, 10 -year Treasury yields rose about 220 basis 
points over the course of a year, reflecting an unexpected quickening in th e pace of 
economic growth and signs of building inflation pressures.  Th is increase in long -term 
rates appears to have reflected a mix of a pronounced rise  in the expected path of the  - 11 - 
policy interest rate and some increase  in the term premium.13  A rise of more than 200 
basis points in a year is at the upper end of what is implied by the mean paths and 
uncertainty measures shown in charts 4 and 5 , but these measures still admit a substantial 
probability of  higher --and lower --paths.  
Overall , then, we anticipate that long -term rates will rise as the recovery 
progresses and expected short -term real rates and term premiums return to more normal 
levels.  The precise timing and pace of the increase will depend importantly on how 
economic condition s develop, however, and is subject to considerable two -sided 
uncertainty.  
Managing Risks Associated with the Future Course of Long -Term Interest Rates  
As I noted when I began my remarks, one reason to focus on the timing and pace 
of a possible increase in  long-term rates is that these outcomes may have implications for  
financial stability.   Commentators have raised two broad concerns surrounding the 
outlook for long -term rates.  To oversimplify, the first risk is that rates will remain low , 
and the second is that they will not.  In particular, in an environment of persistently low 
returns, incentives may grow for some investors to engage in an unsafe “reach for yield” 
either through excessive use of leverage or through other forms of risk -taking.  My Board 
colleague Jeremy Stein recently discussed how this behavior may arise in some financial 
markets , including credit markets .14  Alternatively, we face a risk that longer -term rates 
will rise sharply at some point, imposing capital losses on holders of fixed -income 
                                                 
13 The two components were  intertwined, as  measures of uncertainty about the path of policy moved up 
sharply , likely contributing to a rise in  term premiums.   Notably, i n this episode, the rise in rates created 
some stress in financial markets but did not lead to serious financial instability, nor did it significantly 
impair economic activity.   However, on e would not want to conclude from that one case that sharp rises in 
rates do not pose risks.  
14 See Stein (2013).   - 12 - 
instruments, incl uding financial institutions.  Of course, t he two risks may very well be 
mutually reinforcing :  Taking on duration risk is one way investors may reach for yield, 
and the losses resulting from a sharp rise in longer -term rates will be  greater if investors 
have done so.15  
One might argue that the right response to these risks is to tighten monetary 
policy, raising long -term interest rates with the aim of forestalling any undesirable 
buildup of risk.  I hope my discussion this evening ha s convinced you that, at least in 
economic circumstances of the sort that prevail today, such an approach could be quite 
costly and might well be counterproductive from the standpoint of promoting financial 
stability.  Long -term interest rates in the major  industrial countries are low for good 
reason:  Inflation is low and stable and, given expectations of weak growth, expected real 
short rates are low.  Premature rate increases would carry a high risk of short -circuiting  
the recovery, possibly leading --ironically enough --to an even longer period of low long -
term rates.  Only a strong economy can deliver persistently high real returns to savers and 
investors, and the economies of the major industrial countries are still in the recovery 
phase.  
So how can fina ncial stability concerns --which the Federal Reserve takes very 
seriously --be addressed?  Our strategy , undertaken in cooperation with other regulators 
and central banks , has a number of elements.   
                                                 
15 On the other hand , some risk -taking --such as when an entrepreneur takes out a loan to start a new 
business or an e xisting firm expands capacity --is a necessary element of a healthy economic recovery.  
Moreover , although accommodative monetary policies may increase certain types of risk -taking, in the 
present circumstances they also serve in some ways to reduce risk in the system, most imp ortantly by 
strengthening the overall economy, but also by encouraging firms to rely more on longer -term funding, and 
by reducing debt service costs for households and businesses.   - 13 - 
First, we have greatly increased our macroprudential oversi ght, with a particular 
focus on potential systemic vulnerabilities, including buildups of leverage and unstable 
funding patterns as well as interest  rate risk.16  Under the umbrella of our 
interdisciplinary Large Institutions Supervision Coordinating Commit tee, we pay special 
attention to developments at the largest, most  complex financial firms, making use of 
information gathered in our supervision of the institutions and drawn from financial 
market indicators of their health and systemic vulnerability.  We  also monitor the shadow 
banking sector, especially its interaction with regulated institutions; in this work, we look 
for factors that may leave the system vulnerable to an adverse “fire sale” dynamic, in 
which declining asset values could force leveraged  investors to sell assets, depressing 
prices further.  We exchange information regularly with other regulatory agencies, both 
directly and under the auspices of the Financial Stability Oversight Council.  Throughout 
the Federal Reserve System, w ork in these areas is conducted by experts in banking, 
financial markets, monetary policy, and other disciplines, and  at the Federal Reserve 
Board  we have established our Office for Financial Stability Policy and Research to help 
coordinate this work .  Findings a re presented regularly  to the Board and to the FOMC  for 
use in its monetary policy deliberations . 
Second, recognizing  that our monitoring  of the financial sector  will always be 
imperfect, we are using regulatory and supervisory tools to help  ensure that fi nancial 
institutions are sufficiently resilient  to weather losses and periods of market turmoil  
arising from any source .  Indeed, reflecting expectations  embodied in  the new Basel III 
and Dodd -Frank standards, the largest and most complex financial firms h ave 
substantially increased both their capital and their liquidity in recent years.  Our current 
                                                 
16 See Adrian, Covitz, and Liang (forthcoming).   - 14 - 
round of stress testing of the largest bank holding companies, to be completed early this 
month, examines whether the largest banking firms have sufficient cap ital to  come 
through a seriously adverse economic downturn and still have the capacity to perform 
their roles as providers of credit.  In a related exercise, we  are also asking banks to stress -
test the adequacy of their capital in the face of a hypothetica l sharp upward shift in the 
term structure of interest rates.  
Third, our approach to communicating and implementing monetary policy 
provides the Federal Reserve with new tools that could  potentially be used to  mitigate the 
risk of sharp increases in intere st rates .  In 1994 --the period discussed earlier in which 
sharp increases in interest rates strained financial markets --the FOMC ’s communication 
tools were very limited; indeed, it had just begun issuing public statements following 
policy moves.  By contra st, in recent years, the Federal Reserve has provided a great deal 
of additional information about its expectations for the path of the economy and the 
stance of monetary policy.  Most recently,  as I mentioned,  the FOMC announced 
unemployment and inflation  thresholds characterizing conditions that will guide the 
timing of the first increase in the target for the federal funds rate.   Further, the FOMC 
stated that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy is likely to remain 
appropriate for a considera ble time after our current asset purchase program ends.  By 
providing greater clarity concerning  the likely course of the federal funds rate , FOMC  
communication should both  make policy more effective and reduce the risk that market 
misperceptions of the Co mmittee’s intentions  would lead to unnecessary interest rate 
volatility.    - 15 - 
In addition, the Federal Reserve could, if necessary, use its balance sheet tools to 
mitigate the risk of a sharp rise in rates.  For example, the Committee has indicated its 
intent ion to sell its agency securities gradually once conditions warrant.  The Committee 
also noted, however, that the pace of sales could be adjusted up or down in response to 
material changes in either the economic outlook or financial conditions.   In particu lar, 
adjustments to the pace or timing of asset sales could be used, under some circumstances, 
to dampen excessively sharp  adjustments in longer -term interest rates.  
Conclusion  
Let me finish with some thoughts on balancing the risks we face in the current 
challenging economic environment , at a time when  our main policy tool, the federal 
funds rate, is near its effective lower bound.  On the one hand, the Fed’s dual mandate 
has led  us to provide strong support for the recovery, both to promote maximum 
employment and to keep inflation from falling below our price stability objective.  One 
purpose of this support is to prompt a return to the productive risk -taking that is essential 
to robust growth and  to getting the unemployed back to work.  On the other hand, we 
must be mindful  of the possibility  that sustained periods of low interest rates and highly 
accommodative policy could lead to excessive risk -taking  in some financial markets .  
The balance here is not an easy one to strike.  While the recent crisis is vivid testament to 
the costs of ill -judged risk -taking, we must also be aware of constraints posed by the 
present state of the economy.  In light  of the  moderate  pace of the recov ery and the 
continued high level of economic slack , dialing back accommodation with the goal of 
deterring excessive risk -taking in some areas  poses its own risks to growth, price 
stability, and, ultimately , financial stability.  Indeed, as I noted, a prema ture removal of  - 16 - 
accommodation could, by slowing the economy, perversely serve to extend the period of 
low long-term rates.   
For these reasons, w e are responding to financial stability concerns with the 
multipronged approach I summarized a moment ago , which  relies primarily on 
monitoring, supervision  and regulation , and communication .  We will, however, be 
evaluating these issues carefully and on an ongoing basis ; we will be alert for any 
developments that pose risks to the achievement of the Federal Reserve ’s mandated 
objectives of price stability and maximum employment; a nd we will , of course , remain 
prepared to use all of our tools as needed to address  any such developments .

Good morning.  I am very pleased to welcome you here today.  This conference is 
part of a first -ever public review by the Federal Open Market Committee of our monetary 
policy strategy, tools, and communications.  We have a distinguished group of experts 
from academics and other walks  of life here to share perspectives on how monetary 
policy can best serve the public.  
I’d like first to say a word about recent developments involving trade negotiations 
and other matters .  We do not know how or when these issues  will be resolved.  We are 
closely monitoring  the implications of these developments for the U.S. economic outlook 
and, as always, we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor 
market and inflation near our symmetric 2  percent  objective.   My comments today, like 
this conference, will focus on longer -run issues that will remain even as the issues of the 
moment evolve .  
While central banks face a challenging environment today, thos e challenges are 
not entirely new.  In fact, i n 1999 the Federal Reserve System hosted a conference titled 
“Monetary Policy in a Low Inflation Environment.”  Conferen ce participants discussed 
new challenges that were emerging after the then -recent victory over the Great Inflation.1  
They focused on many questions posed by low inflation and, in particular, on what 
unconventional tools a central bank might use to support  the economy if interest rates fell 
to what we now call the effective lower bound (ELB).  Even though the Bank of Japan 
was grappling with the ELB as the conference met, the issue seemed remote for the 
United States.  The conference received little coverag e in the financial press, but a 
                                                 
1 The proceedings of the conference were published in the November 2000 issue of Journal of Money, 
Credit and Banking.    - 2 - 
Reuters w ire service story titled “Fed C onference Timing on Inflation O dd, but U seful” 
emphasized the remoteness of the risk.2  Participants at the conference could not have 
anticipated that only 10 years later , the world would be engulfed in a deep financial 
crisis, with unemployment soaring and central banks around the world making extensive 
use of new strategies, tools, and ways to communicate.  
 The next time policy rates hit the ELB —and there will be a next t ime—it will not 
be a surprise.  We are now well aware of the challenges the ELB presents, and we have 
the painful experience of the Global Financial Crisis and its aftermath to guide us.  Our 
obligation to the public we serve is to take those measures now that will put us in the best 
position deal with our next encounter with the ELB .  And with the economy growing, 
unemployment low, and inflation low and stable, this is the right time to engage the 
public broadly on these topics.   
The review has several parts, all of which are intended to open our monetary 
policy to critical examination .  We are holding a series of Fed Listens  events around the 
country to help us understand the perspectives of people from diverse backgrounds and 
with varied interests.   This  conference and many other engagements will help us bring to 
bear the best thinking from policymakers and experts.  Beginning later this year, the 
FOMC will devote time at a series of our regular meetings to assess lessons from these 
events, supported by s taff analysis performed throughout the Federal Reserve System.  
We will publicly report the outcome of our discussions.  In the meantime, anyone who is

Board’s website.3 
Before turning to the specifics of the review, I want to focus a little more closely 
on the challenges we face today.  For a reference point, at the time of the 1999 
conference, the United States was eight years into an expansion; core inflation was 
1.4 percent , and the unemployment rate was 4.1 percent —not so different from today.4  
Macroeconomists were puzzling over the flatness of the Phillips curve , the level of the 
natural rate of unemployment , and a possible acceleration in productivity growth—
questions that are also with us today.5 
The big difference between then and now is that the federal funds rate was 
5.2 percent —which, to underscore the point, put the rate 20 quarter -point rate cuts away 
from the ELB.  Since then, standard estimates of the longer -run normal or neutral rate of 
interest have declined between 2 and 3 percentage points, and some argue that the 
effective decline is even larger.6  The combination of lower real interest rates and low 
inflation translates into lower nominal rates and a  much higher likelihood that rates will 
fall to the ELB in a downturn.  
As the experience of the past decade showed, extended ELB episodes can be 
associated with painfully high unemployment and slow  growth or recession .  Economic 
                                                 
3 More on Fed Listens  events and related information is available on the Board’s website at 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review -of-monetary -policy -strategy -tools -and-
communications -fed-listens -events.htm .  
4 The inflation rate referenced is the October 12 -month percent change in the price index for personal 
consumption expenditures excluding food and energy.  
5 The discussion of all these issues was centered on  Fed Chair Alan Greenspan’s  (1998) “New Economy” 
hypothesis  that the U nited States had undergone fundamen tal change s for the  better, leading to the 
otherwise puzzling outcomes.  
6 See, for example, the estimates of the neutral rate  reported on the New York Fed’s website at  
https://www.newyorkfed. org/research/policy/rstar .  Rachel and Summers (2019) give reasons why the 
effective change may be larger.   - 4 - 
weakness  puts downward pressure on inflation, which can raise real interest rates and 
reinforce the challenge of supporting needed job growth.  In addition, over time , inflation 
has become much less sensitive to tightness in resource utilization.  This insensitivity can 
be a blessing in avoiding deflation when unemployment is high , but it means that much 
greater labor market tightness may ultimately be required to bring inflation back to target 
in a recovery.  Using monetary policy to push sufficiently hard on labor markets to lift 
inflation could pose risks of destabilizing excesses in financial markets or elsewhere.   
In short, t he proximity of interest rates to the ELB has become the preeminent 
monetary policy challenge of our time , tainting all manner of issues with ELB risk and 
imbuing many old challenges with greater significance.  For example, the behavior of 
inflation7 now draws much sharper focus.  W hen nominal interest rates were around 4 or 
5 percent, a low -side surprise of a few tenths on inflation did not raise the specter of the 
ELB.  But the world has changed.  Core inflation is currently running a bit below 
2 percent on a trai ling 12 -month basis.  In this setting, a similar low -side surprise, if it 
were to persist, would bring us uncomfortably close r to the ELB.  M y FOMC colleagues 
and I must —and do—take seriously the risk that inflation shortfalls that persist even in a 
robust economy  could precipitate a difficult -to-arrest downward drift in inflation 
expectations .  At the heart of the review is the ev aluation of potential changes to our 
strategy designed to strengthen the credibility of our symmetric 2 percent inflation 
objective.    
                                                 
7 For example, based on the Federal Reserve s taff’s Greenbook forecast, across forecasts prepared for 
59 FOMC meetings between 1997 and 2004, one -third of the year ahead, four -quarter inflation forecast 
errors were 0.5 percentage point or greater in absolute value.  Error tended to be on the low side, and 
45 percent of low -side misses were greater than 0.5 percentage point in absolute value.    - 5 - 
The ELB problem also complicates  the FOMC’s efforts to achieve transparency 
and accountability.  The Fed, like most major  central banks, is insulated from short -term 
political pressures.  In our democracy, that insulation carries with it an obligation for us 
to be transparent and publicly accountable.  When policy rates reached the ELB during 
the crisis, central banks resort ed to what were then new, untested tools to pursue their 
mandated goals.  These tools are no longer new, but their efficacy, costs, and risks remain 
less well understood than the traditional approaches to central banking.  My FOMC 
colleagues and I are comm itted to explaining why the use of these tools in the wake of 
the crisis was a prudent and effective approach to pursuing our congressional mandate 
and why tools like these are likely to be needed again.  Our review is but one part of our 
efforts to engage with the public on these matters.   
Let me turn to the specifics of the review, which is focused on three questions:  
1. Can the Federal Reserve best meet its statutory objecti ves with its 
existing monetary policy strategy, or should it consider strategies that 
aim to reverse past misses of the inflation objective?  
2. Are the existing monetary policy tools adequate to achieve and 
maintain maximum employment and price stability, or  should the 
toolkit be expanded?  
3. How can the FOMC's communication of its policy framework and 
implementation be improved?  
These questions are quite broad, and my colleagues and I come to them with open 
minds.  We believe our current policy framework is wor king well, and we have made no 
decisions about particular changes.  In fact, the review is still in its early stages.    - 6 - 
The first question raises the issue of whether the FOMC should use makeup 
strategies in response to ELB risks.  By the time of the 1999 conference, research was 
beginning to show that —in models , at least —such strategies could substantially reduce 
the unemployment and other costs of ELB spells.8  The simplest version goes like this:  
Suppose that a spell with interest rates near the ELB leads to a persistent shortfall of 
inflation relative to the central bank’s goal.  But what if the central bank promised 
credibly that it would deliberately make up for any lost inflation by stimulating the 
economy and temporarily pushing inflation modestly a bove the target?  In the models, the 
prospect of future stimulus promotes anticipatory consumption and investment that could 
greatly reduce the pain of being at the ELB.9  Policymakers discussed this reasoning in 
the wake of the crisis, but neither the Fed  nor any other major central bank chose to 
pursue such a policy.10  Why?  For makeup strategies to work, households and businesses 
must go out on a limb, so to speak, raising spending in the midst of a downturn.  In 
theory, they would do this based on their  confidence that the central bank will deliver the 
makeup stimulus at some point —perhaps years in the future.  In models, great confidence 
in central bankers is achieved by assumption.  Despite the flattering nature of this 
                                                 
8 See Reifschneider and Williams (2000) and references therein.   For a more recent review of this subject , 
see Bernanke, Kiley, and Roberts (2019) and Mertens and Williams (2019).  
9 Eggertsson and Woodford (2003), for ex ample, show that optimal policy at the ELB entails a commitment 
to reflate the price level during subsequent economic expansions.  See also Wolman (2005) for a discussion 
of the effectiveness of price -level targeting at the ELB.  For a discussion of the re lationship between price -
level targeting and average -inflation targeting, see Nessén and Vestin (2005).  The strategy in 
Reifschneider and Williams (2000), for instance, involves a central bank following a Taylor rule modified 
to make up for shortfalls in policy accommodation during ELB episodes.  Kiley and Roberts (2017) study a 
strategy in which policymakers aim for inflation higher than 2 percent during normal times to compensate 
for below -target inflation during ELB episodes.  Also see Bernanke (2017) f or a strategy in which low 
inflation is made up if it occurs when the federal funds rate is at or near the ELB .  See also Bernanke, 
Kiley, and Roberts (2019) and Mertens and Williams (2019).  
10 The Bank of Japan (2016) came closest, announcing in September 2016 an “ inflation -overshooting 
commitment ” (p. 1).   The commitment did not, however, come with any explicit goal for a degree or 
duration of overshoot.   - 7 - 
assumption, crisis -era policymak ers had major questions about whether their promise of 
good times to come would really have moved the hearts, minds, and pocketbooks of the 
public.  Part of the problem was that the groundwork had not been laid in advance of the 
downturn—a problem we could hope to fix well before next time.  Policymakers also had 
deeper concerns about the legitimacy and effectiveness of attempting to bind some future 
FOMC to take actions that c ould be objectionable from a short -term perspective when the 
time came to deliver .11 
Research on makeup strategies has begun to grapple more seriously with the 
credibility questions.12  But important questions remain.  To achieve buy -in by 
households and businesses, a comprehensible, credible, and actionable makeup strategy 
will need to be followed by years of central bank policy consistent with that strategy.   
The second question asks about the adequacy of the Fed’s toolkit for providing 
stimulus when facing the ELB.  In the United States, we used several different 
formulations of both forward guidance and large -scale purchases of longer -term 
securities.13  While views differ on the effectiveness of these policies, with their use , the 
unemployment rate fell steadily and inflation expectations remained well anchored, 
outcomes that were fav orable overall when viewed against the recoveries of many other 
advanced economies.  My own view is that these policies provided meaningful support 
for demand, but that they should not be thought of as a perfect substitute for our 
                                                 
11 These issues were discussed by the FOMC at several points, especially during 2011 (see the 2011 FOMC 
transcripts, available  on the Board’s website  at 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomchistorical2011.htm ). 
12 See, for example, English, López- Salido, and Tetlow (2015); Hebden and López -Salido (2018); 
Bernanke, Kiley, and Roberts (2019); and Mertens and Williams (2019).  
13 For details on formulations used by the United States for forward guidance and large -scale purchases of 
longer -term securities as well as oth er references, see, for example , 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_openmarketops.htm  and

traditional interest rate  tool.  In any case, we have a responsibility to thoroughly evaluate 
what mix of these tools is likely to work best when the next ELB episode arrives.  
Perhaps it is time to retire the term “unconventional” when referring to tools that 
were used in the cri sis.  We know that tools like these are likely to be needed in some 
form in future ELB spells, which we hope will be rare .  We now have a significant body 
of evidence regarding the effectiveness, costs, and risks of these tools, including those 
used by the FOMC and others tried elsewhere.  Our plans must take advantage of th is 
growing understanding as assessments are refined.   
The third question concerns improving communication, which I discussed earlier 
from the standpoint of governance and accountability.  But transparency also plays a 
central role in policy effectiveness through its effects on the expectations of households 
and businesses .  Of course, this was the major insight behind the transparency revolution 
in central banking over the past few decades.  Today, central banks publicly share  a large 
and ever -increasing amount of information about policy.  But policymakers and 
commentators inside and outside central banks sometimes question whether all of the 
transparency adds up to effective communication.14   
The FOMC’s famous dot  plot is one example.  A focus on the median forecast 
amounts to emphasizing what the typical FOM C participant would do if things go as 
expected .  But we have been living in times characterized by large , frequent , unexpected 
changes in the underlying structure of the economy.15  In this environment, the most 
                                                 
14 A 2016 Brookings c onference titled “ Understanding Fedspeak ” (see 
https://www.brookings.edu/events/understanding -fedspeak ) raised several aspects of this issue.  For 
example, Olson and Wessel  (2016a ) presented results of a survey of those who follow the Fed closel y; in an 
op-ed (2016b), they noted that “Some 73 percent of academics said Fed communications helps the markets; 
only 44 percent of private -sector Fed watchers agreed .”  
15 For more on changes in the underlying structure of the economy, see Powell (2018).   - 9 - 
important policy message may be about how th e central bank will respond to the 
unexpected rather than what it will do if there are no surprises.  Unfortunately, at times 
the dot plot has distracted attention from the more important topic of how the FOMC will 
react to unexpected economic developments .  In times of high uncertainty, the median 
dot might best be thought of as the least unlikely  outcome.  
Let me conclude by saying that I look forward to our discussions here and to the 
ongoing work of the review that lies ahead.  We need the best tools and strategies 
possible for dealing with the challenges we now face, and we must communicate them in 
a clear and credible way.  My colleagues and I welcome your best thinking on these 
issues.

A decade has passed since the beginnings of a global financial crisis that resulted 
in the most severe financial panic and largest contraction in economic activity in the 
United States since the Great Depression.   Already,  for some, memories of this 
experience may be  fading--memories of just how costly the fin ancial crisis was and of 
why certain steps were taken in response.  Today I will look back at the crisis and discuss 
the reforms  policymakers in the United States and around the world have made  to 
improve  financial regulation to limit both the probability  and the adverse conseq uences of 
future financial crises.   
A resilient financial system is critical to a dynamic global economy --the subject 
of this conference.  A well -functioning financial system facilitates productive investment  
and new business formation and helps new and e xisting businesses weather the ups and 
downs of the business cycle.  Prudent  borrow ing enables households to improve their 
standard of living by  purchas ing a home, invest ing in education , or start ing a business.  
Because of the reforms t hat strengthen ed our financial system, and with support from 
monetary and other policies, credit is available on good terms , and lending has advanced 
broadly in line with economic activity in recent years , contributing to today’s strong 
economy .1    
At the same time, reforms  have boosted the resilience  of the financial system.    
Banks are safer .  The risk of runs owin g to maturity transformation is  reduced .  Efforts to 
enhance the resolvability of systemic firms have promoted market discipline and reduced 
                                                 
1 Over the 12 quarters ending in the first quarter of this year, borrowing by the nonfinancial business sector 
increased at an annual rate just above 6 percent, on average, and borrowing by households and nonprofit 
institutions rose at an annual rate of 3 -1/4 percent, on average; the corresponding average pace of increase 
in nominal gross domestic product was 3 -3/4 per cent.  Over the same period, lending by private depository 
institutions advanced at an annual rate of nearly 6 -1/2 percent.   - 2 - 
the problem of too-big-to-fail.  And a system is in place to more effectively monitor and 
address risks that arise outside the regulatory perimeter.   
Nonetheless, the scope and complexity of financial regulatory reforms demand 
that policymakers and researchers remain  alert to both areas for improvement and 
unexpected side effects.  The Federal Reserve is committed to continuing to evaluate the 
effects of regulation on financial stability and on the broader economy  and to making 
appropriate adjustments.  
I will start by reviewing where we were 10 years ago.  I will then walk through  
some key  reforms our country  has put in place to diminish the chances of another severe 
crisis and limit damage during times of financial instability.   After reviewing these st eps, 
I will summarize indicators and research that show the improved resilience of the U.S. 
financial system --resilience that is due  importantly to re gulatory reform as well as  actions 
taken by the private  sector.  I will then turn to the evidence regardin g how financial 
regulatory reform has affected economic growth, credit availability, and market liquidity.   
Developments 10 Years Ago  
The U .S. and global financial system was in a dangerous place 10 years ago.  U.S. 
house prices had peaked in 2006, and strains in the subprime mortgage market grew acute 
over the first half of 2007.2  By August, liquidity in money markets had deteriorated 
enough to require the Federal Reserve to take steps to support it.3  And yet  the discussion

by 50 basis points and announced a change to the Reserve Banks ’ usual practices t o allow the provision of 
term financing for as long as 30 days, renewable by the borrower.  The changes w ere announced to remain 
in place until the Federal Reserve determine d that market liquidity ha d improved materially.   See Board of  - 3 - 
here at Jackson Hole  in August 2007 , with a few notable exceptions, was fairly optimistic  
about  the possible economic fallout  from the stresses apparent  in the financial system .4  
As we now know, the deterioration of liquidity and solvency within the financial 
sector cont inued over the next 13 months.  Accumulating strains across the financial 
system, including the collapse of Bear Stearns in March 2008, made it clear that 
vulnerabilities had risen across the system.  As a result, policymakers took extraordinary 
measures:  The Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) sharply cut the federal funds 
rate, and the Federal Reserve, in coordination with the Treasury Department and other 
agencies, extended liquidity facilities beyond the traditional banking sector, applying to 
the mod ern structure of U.S. money markets the dictum of Walter Bagehot, conceived in 
the 19 th century, to lend freely against good collateral at a penalty rate.5  Still, the 
deterioration in the financial sector continued, with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac failing  
in early September .6   
But the deterioration from early 2007 until early September 2008 --already the 
worst financial disruption in the United States in many decades --was a slow trickle

compared with the tidal wave that nearly wiped out the financial secto r that September 
and led to a plunge  in economic activity in the following months .  Not long after Fannie 
and Freddie were placed in government conservatorship, Lehman Brothers collapsed, 
setting off a week in which American International Group , Inc.  (AIG ), came to the brink 
of failure and required large loans from the Federal Reserve to mitigate the systemic 
fallout; a large money  market fund “broke the buck ” (that is, was unable to maintain a net 
asset value of $1 per share)  and runs on other money funds  accelerated, requiring the 
Treasury to provide a guarantee of money fund liabilities; global dollar funding markets 
nearly collapsed, necessitat ing coordinated action by central banks around the world ; the 
two remaining large investment banks became bank holding companies , thereby ending 
the era of large independent investment banks in the United States ; and the Treasury 
proposed a rescue of the financial sector .  Within several weeks , the Congress passe d--
and President Bush sign ed into law --the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, 
which establishe d the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program ; the Federal Reserve 
initiated further emergency lending programs ; and the F ederal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation  (FDIC) guaranteed a broad range of bank debt.7  Facing similar challenges in 
their own jurisdictions, many foreign governments also undertook aggressive measures to 
support the functioning of credit markets, including large -scale capital injections into 
banks, expansions of deposit insurance progr ams, and guarantees of some forms of bank 
debt.

Lynch, and Morgan Stanley.  Merrill Lynch agreed to be acquired by Bank of America, and the remaining 
two firms became bank holding companies.   - 5 - 
Despite the forceful policy responses by the Treasury, the Congress, the FDIC, 
and the Federal Reserve as well as authorities abroad, the crisis continued to intensify:  
The vulnerabilities in the U.S. and g lobal  econom ies had grown too large, and the 
subsequent damage was enormous .  From the beginning of 2008 to early 2010, nearly 
9 million jobs , on net , were lost in the United States.  Millions of Americans lost their 
homes.  And distress was not limited to  the U.S. economy:  Global trade and economic 
activity contracted to a degree that had not been seen since the  1930s .  The economic 
recovery that followed, despite extraordinary policy actions, was painfully slow.   
What the Crisis Revealed and How Policymakers Have Responded  
These painful events re newed  efforts to guard against financial instability.  The 
Congress, the Administration, and regulatory agencies implemented new laws, 
regulations , and supervisory practices to limit the risk of another cri sis, in coordination 
with policymakers around the world.  
The vulnerabilities within the financial system in the mid -2000s were numerous  
and, in hindsight,  familiar from past financial panics.  Financial institutions had assumed 
too much risk, especially re lated to the housing market , through mortgage lending 
standards that were far too lax and contributed to substantial overborrowing.  Repeating a 
familiar pattern , the “madness of crowds ” had contributed to a bubble, in which investors 
and households expect ed rapid appreciation in house price s.  The long period of 
economic stability beginning in the 1980s had led to complacency  about potential risks, 
and the buildup of risk was not widely recognized.8  As a result, market and supervisory 
                                                 
8 The notion that popular sentiment may contribute to mispricing of assets --for example, the power of the 
madness of crowds --is attributed to Charles Mackay (1841) , Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions 
and the Madness of Crowds  (London:  Richard Bentley ).  A more modern perspective, and one using a  - 6 - 
discipline was lacki ng, and financial institutions were allowed to take on high levels of 
leverage.  This leverage was facilitated by short -term wholesale borrowing, owing in part 
to market -based vehicles , such as money  market mutual funds and asset -backed 
commercial paper  programs  that allowed the rapid expansion of liquidity transformation  
outside of the regulated depository sector.  Finally, a self -reinforcing loop developed, in 
which all of the factors I have just cited intensified as investors sought ways to gain 
exposure to the rising prices of assets linked to housing and the financial sector.  As a 
result, securitization and the development of complex derivative s products dis tributed  
risk across institutions in ways that were opaqu e and ultimately destabilizing.  
In response, p olicymakers around the world have put in place measures to limit a 
future buildup of similar vulnerabilities.  The United States, through coordinated 
regulatory action and legislation, moved very rapidly to beg in reforming our financial 
system, and the speed with which our banking system returned to health provides 
evidence of the effectiveness of that strategy.  Moreover, U.S. leadership of global efforts 
through bodies such as the Basel Committee on Banking Su pervision, the Financial 
Stability Board (FSB), and the Group of Twenty  has contributed to the development of 
standards that promote financial stability  around the world, thereby supporting global 
growth while protecting the U.S. financial system from adve rse developments abroad.   
                                                 
phrase as memorable as the madness of crowds, is provided by Robert J. Shiller (2016) , Irrational 
Exuberance,  3rd ed. (Princeton, N.J.:  Princeton University Press ).  The notion that economic stability can 
gene rate a buildup of imbalances that subsequently contributes to instability is presented in Hyman P. 
Minsky (1974), “The Modeling of Financial Instability:  An Introduction,” in Modeling and Simulation, 
Vol. 5, Part 1 , proceedings of the Fifth Annual Pittsbu rgh Conference (Pittsburgh:  Instrument Society of 
America), pp. 267 -72, http://digitalcommons.bard.edu/hm_archive/467 .  A related discussion of how 
financial excesses often precede downturns ( and even panics) is provided in Charles P. Kindleberger and

Preeminent among these domestic and global efforts have been steps to increase the loss -
absorbing capacity of banks, regulations to limit both maturity transformation in short -
term funding markets and liquidity mismatches within banks, and new authorities to 
facilitate the resolution of large financial institutions and to subject systemically 
important firms to more stringent prudential regulation.  
Several important reforms have increased the loss -absorbing capacity of global 
bank s.  First, the quantity and quality of capital required  relative to risk -weighted assets 
have been increased substantially.9  In addition, a simple leverage ratio provides a 
backstop, reflecting the lesson imparted by past crises that risk weights are impe rfect and 
a minimum amount of equity capital should fund a firm’s total assets.  Moreover, both 
the risk -weighted and simple leverage requirements are higher for the largest, most 
systemic firms , which lowers the risk of distress at such firms and encourag es them  to 
limit activities that could threaten  financial stability.10  Finally, the largest U.S. banks 
participate in the annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review  (CCAR) --the 
                                                 
9 These improvements encompass a number of changes.  The regula tory requirements for capital have been 
increased and focus on Tier 1 common equity, which proved more capable of absorbing losses than lower -
quality forms of capital.  The role of bank internal models in determining risk -weighted assets also has 
been sign ificantly constrained in the United States.   In addition, exposures previously considered off 
balance sheet have been incorporated into risk -weighted assets.  
10 The Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency adopted a  final 
rule to strengthen the leverage ratio standards for the largest, most interconnected U.S. banking 
organizations  on April 8, 2014.  Under the final rule, c overed bank holding companies  must maintain a 
leverage buffer of 2 percentage points above the minimum supplementary leverage ratio requirement of 
3 percent, for a total of 5 percent, to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus 
payments  (see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 
and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (2014), “Agencies Adopt Enhanced Supplementary 
Leverage Ratio Final Rule and Issue Supplementary Leverage Ratio Not ice of Proposed Rulemaking,” joint 
press release, April 8, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20140408a.htm ).  
The Federal Reserve approved  a final rule imposing risk -based capital surcharges on  the largest, most 
systemically important U.S. bank holding companies  on July 20, 2015; in connection with the final rule, the 
Board issued a white paper describing the calibration of the risk -based ca pital surcharges (see Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2015), “Federal Reserve Board Approves Final Rule Requiring 
the Largest, Most Systemically Important U.S. Bank Holding Companies to Further Strengthen Their 
Capital Positions,” press r elease, July 20, 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20150720a.htm ).  - 8 - 
stress tests.  In addition to contributing to greater loss -absorbing capa city, the CCAR 
improve s public understanding of risks at large banking firms, provide s a forward -
looking examination of firms’ potential losses during severely adverse economic 
conditions, and ha s contributed to significant improvements in risk management.  
Reforms have also addressed the risks associated with maturity transformation.  
The fragility created by deposit -like liabilities outside the traditional banking sector has 
been mitigated by regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commissio n 
affecting prime institutional money  market funds.  These rules  require these prime  funds 
to use a floating net  asset value, among other changes, a shift that has made these  funds 
less attractive as cash -management vehicles.  The changes at money funds ha ve also 
helped reduce banks’  reliance on unsecured short -term wholesale funding, since  prime 
institutional funds were  significant investors in those  bank liabilities.  Liquidity risk at 
large banks ha s been further mitigated by a new  liquidity coverage rat io and a capital 
surcharge for global  systemically important banks  (G-SIBs ).  The liquidity coverage ratio 
requires that banks h old liquid assets to cover potential net cash outflows over a 30 -day 
stress period .  The capital surcharge for U.S. G-SIBs links  the required level of capital for 
the largest banks to their reliance on short -term wholesale funding.11 
While improvements in capital and liquidity regulation will limit the reemergence 
of the risks that grew substantially in the mid -2000s, the failure of  Lehman Brothers 
demonstrated how the absence of an adequate resolution process for dealing with a 
                                                 
11 Moreover, the Federal Reserve’s Comprehensive  Liquidity Analysis and Review, in which supervisors 
analyze the liquidity risks and practices at large banks , has promoted improvements in liquidity -risk 
management .  The U.S. banking agencies  also ha ve proposed a net stable funding ratio (NSFR) to help 
ensure that large banks h ave a stable funding profile over a one -year horizon , and we are working toward 
finalization of the NSFR.   - 9 - 
failing systemic firm left policymakers with only the terrible choices of a bailout or 
allowing a destabilizing collapse.  In recognition of this shortcoming , the Congress  
adopted  the orderly liquidation authority in Title II of the Dodd -Frank Wall Street 
Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd -Frank Act)  to provide  an alternative 
resolution mechanism for systemically  important firms to be used instead of bankruptcy 
proceedings when necessary to preserve financial stability.  Th e orderly liquidation 
authority contains a number of tools, including liquidity resources and temporary stays on 
the termination of financial contracts, that would help protect the fina ncial system and 
economy from the severe adverse spillovers that could occur if a systemic firm fail ed.  
Importantly, any losses incurred by the government in an Orderly Liquidation Authority 
resolution would not be at the expense of taxpayers, since the statute provides that all 
such losses must be borne by other large financial firms through subsequent assessments.  
In addition, the Congress required that the large st banks submit living wills that describe 
how they could be resolved  under bankruptcy .12  And the Federal Reserve has mandated 
that systemically  important banks meet total loss -absorbing capacity requirements, which 
require these firms to maintain long -term debt adequate to absorb losses and recapitalize 
the firm in resolution.  These enhanc ements in resolvability protect financial stability and 
help ensure that the shareholders and  creditors of failing firms bear losses .  Moreover, 
these steps promote  market discipline , as creditors --knowing full well that they will bear 
                                                 
12 In addition to these steps, the Board issued another proposal to make G -SIBs more resolvable in May of 
last year ( see Board of Governors of the Fede ral Reserve System (2016), “Federal Reserve Board Proposes 
Rule to Support U.S. Financial Stability by Enhancing the Resolvability of Very Large and Complex 
Financial Firms,” press release, May 3, 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20160503b.htm ).  This proposed rule would 
impose restrictions on G -SIBs’ qualified financial contracts --including derivatives and repurchase 
agreements (or repos) --to guard against the rapid, mass unwinding of those contracts during the resolution 
of a G -SIB.  The proposed restrictions are a key step toward G -SIB resolvability because rapidly unwinding 
these contracts could destabilize the financial system by causin g asset fire sales and toppling other firms.   - 10 - 
losses in the event of distress --dema nd prudent risk -taking, thereby  limiting the problem 
of too -big-to-fail.   
Financial stability risks can also grow large outside the regulated banking sector, 
as amply demonstrated by the events of  2007 and 2008.  In response, a number of 
regulatory changes affecting what is commonly referred to as the shadow  banking sector 
have been instituted.  A specific example  of such risks , illustrative of broader 
developments, was the buildup of large counterparty exposures through derivatives 
betwee n market participants and AIG that were both inappropriately risk -managed and 
opaque.  To mitigate the potential for such risks to arise again , new standards require  
central clearing of standardized over-the-counter derivatives, enhanced reporting 
requirements  for all derivatives , and higher capital as well as margin requirements for 
noncentrally cleared derivative s transactions.13 
Another important step was the Congress ’s creat ion of the Financial Stability 
Oversight Council (FSOC) .  The council is responsible for  identifying risks to financial 
stability  and for designat ing those financial institutions that are systemically  important 
and thus subject to prudential regulation by the Federal Reserve.  Both of these 
responsibilities  are important to help guard against the risk that vulnerabilities outside the 
existing regulatory perimeter grow to levels that jeopardize financial stability.14  
                                                 
13 One area in which regulations have shifted to a lesser degree in the United States is that of time -varying 
macroprudential tools, in which regulatory requirements are adjusted to address changes in vulnerabili ties 
that may affect the financial system.  For example, U.S. regulatory authorities have adopted rules that allow 
use of the countercyclical capital buffer, but other time -varying tools are limited in the United States.  This 
issue is discussed in, for ex ample, Stanley Fischer  (2015), “ Macroprudential Policy in the U.S. Economy ,” 
speech delivered a t “Macroprudential Monetary Policy, ” 59th Economic Conference of the Federal Reserve 
Bank of Boston, Boston, October 2, 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/fischer20151002a.htm . 
14 For example, the FSOC contributed, through its identification process, to the development of the 
Securities and Exchange Commission  reforms affecting money  market funds.  The FSOC has also  - 11 - 
The Financial System Is Safer 
The evidence shows that reforms since the crisis have made the financial system 
substantially safer.  Loss -absorbing capacity among the largest banks is significantly  
higher, with Tier 1 common equity capital more than doubling from early  2009 to now .15  
The annual stress -testing exercises in recent years have led to improvements in the capital 
positions and risk -management processes among participating banks.  Large b anks have 
cut their reliance on short -term wholesale  funding essentially in half and hold 
significantly more high -quality, liquid assets.  Assets under management at prime 
institutional money market funds that proved susceptible to runs  in the crisis  have 
decreased substantially.  And the ability of regulators to resolve a large institution has 
improved, reflec ting both new authorities and tangible steps taken by  institutions to 
adjust their organizational and capital structure in a manner that enhances their 
resolvability  and significantly reduces the problem of t oo-big-to-fail. 
The progress evident in regulato ry and supervisory metrics has been accompanied 
by shifts in private -sector assessments that also suggest enhanced financial stability.  
Investors have recognized the progress achieved toward ending too -big-to-fail, and 
several rating agencies have removed  the government support rating uplift that they once 
accorded to the largest banks.  Credit default swaps for the large banks also suggest that 
                                                 
designated four firms as systemically important --AIG, GE Capital, Prudential, and MetLife.  GE Capital 
chose to shrink, adjust its business model, and reduce its footprint in short -term wholesale fu nding 
markets --and hence reduce a source of systemic risk.  These actions caused the FSOC to subsequently 
remove its designation as systemically important last year --illustrating how the designation process allows 
both identifying systemic firms and removi ng such designations when appropriate.   
15 The increase in Tier 1 common equity among bank holding companies has been sizable, especially for 
the largest banks.  If the largest banks are defined as either the eight U.S. global systemically important 
banks or the U.S. bank holding companies that participated in the CCAR in 2017 (and for which data are 
available for 2009:Q1), Tier 1 common equity has more than doubled in dollar terms and relative to risk -
weighted assets from the first quarter of 2009 to the m ost recent observations.   - 12 - 
market participants assign a low probability to the distress of a large U.S. banking firm.  
Market -based assessm ents of the loss -absorbing capacity of large U.S. banks have moved 
up in recent years , and market -based measures of equity now lie in the range of book 
estimates of equity.  To be sure, market -based measures may not reflect true risks --they 
certainly did n ot in the mid -2000s --and hence the observed improvements should not be 
overemphasized.16  But supervisory metrics are not perfect , either , and policymakers and 
investors should continue to monitor a range of supervisory and market -based indicators 
of financ ial system resilience .   
Economic research provides further support for the notion that reforms have made 
the system safer.  Studies have demonstrated that higher levels of bank capital mitigate 
the risk and adverse effects of financial crises.17  Moreover,  researchers have highlighted 
how liquidity regulation supports financial stability by complement ing capital 
                                                 
16 For example, Natasha Sarin and Lawrence Summers have reviewed market -based measures of bank 
equity and related measures of bank risks and concluded that such measures have not improved since the 
mid-2000s.  This assessment may un derstate the improvement in fundamental risk within the banking 
sector, as it takes the elevated valuations and low assessment of default risk implied by market prices 
during the earlier period as indicative of fundamentals.  Despite these shortcomings, th eir analysis is a 
useful reminder of the importance of considering both regulatory metrics and assessments implied by 
market prices.  See Natasha Sarin and Lawrence H. Summers (2016), “Understanding Bank Risk through 
Market Measures,” Brookings Papers on E conomic Activity,  Fall, pp. 57 -109, 
https://www.brookings.edu/wp -content/uploads/2017/02/sarintextfall16bpea.pdf . 
17 For example, see the review of evidence in Simo n Firestone, Amy Lorenc, and Ben Ranish (2017), “An 
Empirical Economic Assessment of the Costs and Benefits of Bank Capital in the US,” Finance and 
Economics Discussion Series 2017 -034 (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 
April),  https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2017034pap.pdf .  Some research is less 
supportive of the role of bank capital in limiting the risk of financial crises but s uggests that higher levels of 
bank capital limit the economic costs of a financial crisis (for example, Òscar Jordà, Björn Richter, Moritz 
Schularick, and Alan M. Taylor  (2017), “ Bank Capital Redux:  Solvency, Liquidity, and Crisis ,” NBER 
Working Paper Ser ies 23287 (Cambridge, Mass.:  National Bureau of Economic Research, March)).  Some 
of the differences in findings across studies may be due to the degree to which the studies incorporate data 
from different countries and over different periods, as research ers disagree over the extent to which 
comparisons across countries or periods appropriately account for other factors that differ across such 
dimensions.   - 13 - 
regulation.18  Economic models of the resilienc e of the financial sector --so called top -
down stress -testing models --reinforce the message from supervisory stress tests that the 
riskiness of large banks has diminished over the past  decade.19  Similarly, model -based 
analyses indicate that the risk of adverse fire  sale spillovers across banks or broker -
dealers have  been sub stantially mitigated.20 
Is This Safer System Supporting Growth?  
I suspect many in this audience would agree with the narrative of my remarks so 
far:  The events of the crisis demanded action , needed reforms were implemented , and 
these reforms have made the system safer.  Now --a decade from the onset of the crisis 
and nearly seven years since the passage of the Dodd -Frank Act and international 
agreement on the key banking reforms --a new question is being asked:  Have reforms 
gone too far, resulting in a finan cial system that is too burdened to support prudent risk -
taking and economic growth?  
The Fed eral Reserve is committed individually , and in coordination  with other 
U.S. government  agencies through forums such as the FSOC and internationally through 
bodies s uch as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the FSB, to evaluating

the effects of financial  market regulations and considering appropriate adjustments.  
Furthermore , the Federal Reserve has independently taken steps to evaluate potential  
adjustme nts to its regulatory and supervisory practices.  For example, the Federal Reserve 
initiated a review of its stress tests following the 2015 cycle , and this review suggested 
changes to reduce the burden on participating institutions, especially smaller ins titutions, 
and to better align the supervisory stress tests with regulatory capital requirements.21  In 
addition, a broader set of changes to the new financial regulatory framework may deserve 
consideration.  Suc h changes include adjustments t hat may simpli fy regulations applying 
to small and medium -sized  banks and enhance resolution planning .22 
More broadly, we continue to monitor economic conditions, and to review and 
conduct research, to better understand the  effect of regulatory reforms and possible 
implications for regulation .  I will briefly summarize the current state of play in two 
areas:  the effect of regulation on credit availability and on changes in market liquidity.  
                                                 
21 In response to the Federal Reserve’s review and other information, the Board finalized a rule adjusting its 
capital plan and stress -testing rules, effective for the 2017 cycle , on January 30, 2017 .  The final rule 
removes large and noncomplex firms from the qualitative assessment of the Federal Reserve ’s CCAR , 
reducing significant burden on these firms and focusing the qualitative review in CCAR on the largest, 
most complex financial institutions.   More generally, changes to improve regulatory and supervisory 
practices related to stress testing by reducing unn ecessary burden while preserving resilience are under 
consideration.  Possible changes have been discussed in  Daniel K. Tarullo (2016), “Next Steps in the

Reserve Board has continued to engage in international efforts to assess the effects of reforms and possible 
adjustments; in this  context, the FSB has developed a framework for the post -implementation evaluation of 
the effects of the Group of Twenty financial regulatory reforms ; see Financial Stability Board (2017),

The effects of capital regulation on credit availability have been investiga ted 
extensively.  Some studies suggest that higher capital weighs on banks’ lending, while 
others suggest that higher capital supports lending.23  Such conflict ing results in academic 
research are  not altogether surprising .  It is difficult to  identif y the effects of regulatory 
capital requiremen ts on lending because material  changes to capital requirements are rare 
and are often precipitated, as in the recent case, by financial crises that also have large 
effects on lending.  
Given the uncertainty regarding the effect of capital regulation on lending , 
rulemakings of the Federal Reserve and other agencies were informed by analyses that 
balanced the possible stability gains from greater loss -absorbing capacity against the 
possible adverse effects on lending and  economic growth .24  This ex ante  assessment 
pointed to sizable net benefits to economic growth from higher capital standards --and 
subsequent research supports this assessment.25  The steps to improve the capital

“The Credit Crunch ,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity , no. 2, pp. 205 -47.  Research finding a 
sizable negative relationship between capital requirements and lending includes Shekhar Aiyar , Charles W. 
Calomiris , and Tomasz Wieladek  (2014 ), “Does Macro -Prudential Regulation Leak?  Evidence from a UK 
Policy Experiment ,” Journal of Money, Credit and Banking,  vol. 46  (s1; February ), pp. 181-214.  Research 
finding little relationship between lending and capital ratios (outside fi nancial crises) includes Mark 
Carlson, Hui Shan, and Missaka Warusawitharana (2013), “ Capital Ratios and Bank Lending:  A Matched 
Bank Approach ,” Journal of Financial Intermediation , vol. 22 (October) , pp. 663 -87.  Research suggesting 
that higher capital levels may increase lending includes Leonardo Gambacorta and Hyun Song Shin (2016),

International S ettlements , April), www.bis.org/publ/work558.pdf .

25 The ex ante  studies from the Basel Committee and the Macroeconomic Assessment Group referenced in

economic welfare) includes Michael T. Kiley and Jae W. Si m (2014 ), “Bank Capital and the

positions of banks promptly and significantly  following the crisis, beginning with the 
2009 Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, have resulted in a return of lending 
growth and profitability among U.S. banks more quickly than among their global peers.  
While material adverse effects of capital regulation on broad measures of lending 
are not readily apparent, credit may be less available to some borrowers , especially 
homebuyers  with less -than-perfect credit histories and, perhaps, small businesses.  In 
retrospect , mortgage borrowing was clearly too easy for some households  in the mid -
2000s, resulting in debt burdens that were unsustainable and ultimately damaging  to the 
financial system .  Current ly, many factors are likely affecting mortgage lending, 
including changes in market perceptions of the risk associated with mortgage lending; 
changes in practices at the government -sponsored enterprises  and the Federal Housing 
Administration ; changes in technology that may be contributing to entry by nonbank 
lenders; changes in consumer protection regulations; and, perhaps to a limited degree, 
changes in capital and liquidity regulations within the banking sector.  These issues are 
complex and interact with a broade r set of challenges related to the domestic housing 
finance system.  
                                                 
Stracca , Javier Suarez , and Alexandros P. Vardoulakis (2015 ), “Capital Regulation in a Macroeconomic 
Model with Three Layers of Default, ” International Journal of Central Banking,  vol. 11  (June), pages 9 -63; 
and Juliane Begenau (2016), “Capital Requirements, Risk Choice, and Liquidi ty Provision in a Business 
Cycle Model,” unpublished paper, Harvard Business School, September.  Subsequent analyses, albeit ones 
that follow similar approaches, also suggest that there are net benefits to higher capital standards.  One 
example is the anal ysis by Firestone, Lorenc, and Ranish, “An Empirical Economic Assessment,” in 
note 17.  Another is Ingo Fender and Ulf Lewrick (2016), “Adding It All Up:  The Macroeconomic Impact 
of Basel III and Outstanding Reform Issues,” BIS Working Papers 591 (Basel, Switzerland:  Bank for 
International Settlements, November), www.bis.org/publ/work591.pdf .  Indeed, this research points to 
benefits from capital requirements in excess of those adopted, a conclusion also  reached in Wayne  
Passmore and Alexander H. von Hafften (2017) , “Are Basel ’s Capital Surcharges for Global Systemically 
Important Banks Too Small? ” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2017 -021 (Washington:  Board of 
Governors  of the Federal Reserve Sys tem, February),

Credit appears broadly available to small businesses with solid credit histories, 
although indicators point to some difficulties facing firms with weak credit scores and 
insufficient credi t histories.26  Small business formation is critical to economic dynamism 
and growth.  Smaller firms rely disproportionately on lending from smaller banks, and 
the Federal Reserve has been taking steps and examin ing additional  steps to reduce 
unnecessary complexity in regulations affecting smaller banks.27 
Finally, many financial market participants have expressed concerns about the 
ability to transact in volume at low cost --that is, about  market liquidity, particularly in 
certain fixed -income markets such as  that for corporate bonds.  Market liquidity for 
corporate bonds remains robust overall, and the healthy condition of the market is 
apparent in low bid -ask spreads and the large volume of corporate bond issuance in 
recent years.  That said, liquidity condi tions are clearly evolving.  Large dealers appear to 
devote less of their balance sheet s to holding inventories of securities to facilitate trades 
and instead increasingly facilitate trades by directly matching buyers and sellers.  In 
                                                 
26 This conclusion is consistent with, for example, the findings in Federal Reserve Banks (2017), 2016 
Small Business Credit Survey:  Report on Employer Firms  (New York:  Federal Reserve Bank of New 
York, April), https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/smallbusiness/2016/SBCS -Report -
EmployerFirms -2016.pdf .  
27  As I have discussed previously, the Federal Reserve has been considering improvements through a 
number of work streams.  For example, the Federal Reserve and the other banking agencies have recently 
completed the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA) review.  Under 
EGRPRA, the federal banking agencies are required to conduct a joint review of their regulations every 
10 years to identify provisions that are outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome.  The Federal Reserve 
viewed t his review as a timely opportunity to step back and identify ways to reduce regulatory burden, 
particularly for smaller or less complex banks that pose less risk to the U.S. financial system.  I discussed 
preliminary emerging themes from this review in Jan et L. Yellen (2016), “Supervision and Regulation,” 
statement before the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, September 28, 
https://www.federa lreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/yellen20160928a.htm .  For the final EGRPRA 
report to the Congress, see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Office of the Comptroller of 
the Currency, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and National Credi t Union Administration (2017), 
Joint Report to Congress:  Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act  (Washington:  
Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, March),

addition, algorithmic  traders and institutional investors are a larger presence in various 
markets than previously, and the willingness of these  institutions to support liquidity in 
stressful conditions is uncertain.  While no single factor appears to be the predomina nt 
cause of the evolution of market liquidity, some regulations may be affecting market 
liquidity somewhat .  There may be benefits to simplifying aspects of the Volcker rule , 
which  limit s proprietary trading  by banking firms , and to reviewing  the interaction of the 
enhanced supplementary leverage ratio with risk -based capital requirements.  At the same 
time, the new regulatory framework overall has made dealers more resilient to shocks, 
and, in the past, distress at dealers following adverse shocks has been an impor tant factor 
driving market illiquidity.  As a result, any adjustments to the regulatory framework 
should be modest and preserve the increase in resilience at large dealers and banks 
associated with the reforms put in place in recent years.   
Remaining Chal lenges  
So where do we stand a decade after the onset of the most severe financial crisis 
since the Great Depression?  Substantial progress has been made toward the Federal 
Reserve’s economic objectives of maximum employment and price stability , in putting in 
place a regulatory and supervisory structure that is well  designed to lower the risks to 
financial stability , and in actually achieving a stronger financial system .  Our more 
resilient financial system is better prepared  to absorb, rather tha n amplify, adverse 
shocks , as has been illustrated during periods of market turbulence in recent years.  
Enhanced resilience supports the ability of banks and other financial institutions to lend, 
thereby supporting economic growth through good times and b ad.  - 19 - 
Nonetheless , there is more work to do.  The balance of research suggests that the 
core reforms we have put in place have substantially boosted resilience without unduly 
limiting credit availability or economic growth .  But many reforms have been 
implem ented  only fairly recently , markets continue to adjust, and research remains 
limited.  The Federal Reserve is committed to evaluating where reforms are working and 
where improvements are needed to most efficiently maintain a resilient financial system.   
Moreover, I expect that the evolution of the financial system in response to global 
economic forces, technology , and, yes, regulation will result sooner or later in the all -too-
familiar risks of excessive optimism, leverage, and maturity transformation reem erging in 
new ways that require policy responses.  We relearned this lesson through the pain 
inflicted by the crisis.   We can never be sure that new crises will not occur, but if we keep 
this lesson fresh in our memories --along with the painful cost that w as exacted by the 
recent crisis --and act accordingly , we have reason to hope that the financial system and 
economy will experience fewer crises and recover from any future  crisis more quickly, 
sparing households and businesses some of the pain they endured  during  the crisis that 
struck a decade ago.    ",2017-08-25,yellen

“International Roles of the U.S. Dollar ,” a research conference sponsored by  
the Federal Reserve Board  
 
Washington, DC  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
June  17, 2022 
  
 Good morning, and welcome to the inaugural conference on the International 
Roles of the U.S. Dollar.  Thank you all for participating and for lending your expertise 
on this important topic.  This conference marks the first use of our new Martin 
Conference Center, which I hope you enjoy.   
The international financial and monetary system that emerged after W orld War II 
has been defined by the centrality of the dollar.  It is the world’s reserve currency and the 
most widely used for payments and investments.  As outlined in recent work by Board 
staff,  this global preeminence has been supported by the depth and  liquidity of U.S. 
financial markets , the size and strength of the U.S. economy , its stability and openness to 
trade and capital flows , and international trust in U.S. institutions and the rule of law.1  
Professor Barry Eichengreen will expand on some of these themes later this morning.   
The dollar’s international role holds multiple benefits.  For the United States , it 
lowers transaction fees and borrowing costs for U.S. households, businesses, and the 
government.  Its ubiquity helps contain uncertainty and, relatedly, the cost of hedging for 
domestic households and businesses.  For foreign economies, the wide use of the dollar 
allows borrowers to have access to a broad pool of lenders and investor s, which reduces 
their funding and transaction costs.  The benefits of the dollar as the dominant reserve 
currency ha ve generated an extensive academic literature.  Yesterday’s paper on the 
Treasury market by Alexandra Tabova and Frank Warnock extends that work in 
meaningful ways.

The Federal Reserve’s strong commitment to our price stability mandate 
contributes to the widespread confidence in the dollar as a store of value.  To that end, 
my colleagues and I are acutely focused on returning inflation  to our 2  percent  objective .  
Meeting  our dual mandate also de pends on maintaining financial stability.   The Fed’s 
commitment to both our dual mandate and financial stability encourages the international 
community to hold and use dollars.   
The wide use of the dollar globally can also pose financial stability challen ges 
that can materially affect households, businesses, and markets.  For that reason, t he 
Federal Reserve has played a key role in promoting financial stability and supporting the 
use of dollars internationally through our liquidity facilities .  The centra l bank liquidity 
swap lines  provide foreign central banks with the capacity to deliver U.S. dollar funding 
to institutions in their jurisdictions.  A nd the Foreign and International Monetary 
Authorities (FIMA) Repo Facility  allows approved FIMA account holders  the option to 
temporarily exchange their U.S. Treasury securities held by the Federal Reserve for U.S. 
dollars .  These facilities serve as  liquidity backstops  so that holders of dollar assets and 
participants in dollar  funding markets can be confident that strains will be eased when 
these markets come under stress.   That assurance , in turn, mitigates the effect of such 
strains on the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.   Both facilities enhance 
the standing  of the dollar as the dominant global currency.   
The swap lines were extensively used during the Global Financial Crisis, the 2011 
euro-area debt crisis, and the financial turmoil at the outset of the COVID -19 pandemic 
in 2020.  The paper on central bank s wap lines presented yesterday by Gerardo Ferrara, 
Philippe Mueller, Ganesh Viswanath -Natraj, and Junxuan Wang provides novel micro - 
 - 3 - 
level evidence on the usefulness of swap lines in providing cross -border liquidity to 
support the real economy.   
Looking for ward, r apid changes are taking place in the global monetary system  
that may affect the international role of the dollar in the future .  Most major economies 
already have or are in the process of developing instant, 24 /7 payments.  Our own 
FedNow service wi ll be coming online in 2023.  And in light of the tremendous growth in 
crypto -assets and stablecoins, the Federal Reserve is examining whether a U.S. central 
bank digital currency (CBDC) would improve on an already safe and efficient domestic 
payments syst em.  As the Fed’s white paper on this topic notes, a U.S. CBDC could also 
potentially help maintain the dollar’s international standing.2  As we consider feedback 
from the paper, we will be thinking not just about the current state of the world, but also 
how the global financial system might evolve over the next 5 to 10 years.  The paper by 
Jiakai Chen and Asani Sarkar, which is on today’s program, and our distinguished 
panelists on this topic this afternoon, will provide important insights on this issue.  
To summarize, I would like to stress the importance of the dollar to the U.S. and 
global econom ies and financial markets.   It is critical that we understand the channels, 
connections, and effects of the role of the dollar.   
In closing, I want to thank you all for taking the time to join our discussion on the 
dollar’s international roles.  This conference brings together  world -class researchers, 
practitioners, and policymakers dedicated to understanding and addressing these vital 
issues.  I look forward to t heir insights and I hope you enjoy the conference.

“Community Banking  in the 21st Century ”  
Fourth Annual Community Banking Research and Policy Conference, sponsored by  
the Federal Reserve System and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors  
 
St. Louis , Missouri  
 
 
 
    
September 29 , 2016  
  
Welcome to D ay 2 of the conference.  I am grateful to the organizing committee 
for inviting me to be part of this important event once again.  This is the third time that I 
have had the privilege of addressing this unique audience, which brings together bankers, bank supervisors, and banking researchers to share their thoughts regarding the current and future state of community banking.  The interactions that occur at these annual gatherings are incredibly valuable and stimulate innovative thinking on the part of all three groups of participants.   
As usual, the organizers have put together a highly  relevant agenda.  I was 
particularly struck by the way in which this year’s program spans generations, from last night’s keynote speaker, Gene Rainbolt, who began his career  in banking more than 
50 years ago, to the winners of the case study competition, who are just preparing to 
embark on their careers.  I hope that these impressive and accomplished young men and 
women will enjoy long and successful careers in banking that t hey will be able to reflect 
back on during the 54th  annual community banking conference in 2066.  I have already 
penciled in the date on my calendar , and I look forward to hearing what they will have to 
say.   
While the keynote addresses, case study compet ition, and networking 
opportunities all contribute to the appeal of this event, it is the research sessions that form the core of the conference.  In the first research session yesterday , we heard about the 
importance of community banks to the Missouri economy, the viability of the traditional 
banking model, what is special about community banks, and the changing characteristics of the communities served by minority depository institutions.  In the second session, we heard about the relationship between bank size and performance from three quite  - 2 - 
different perspectives.  Both of these sessions provided cause for optimism about the 
future relevance and importance of community banks while simultaneously raising concerns about the viability of the very smallest banking organizations. 
In my remarks today, I would like to explore this mixed message a bit further and 
ask what the observed trends in the data imply for today’s community bankers and the communities they serve.  In doing so , I will look at changes in th e community banking 
sector at a national level and will also look at geographic patterns of community bank growth and decline.  For purposes of these remarks, I  will define community banks as 
those with less than $10 billion in assets, although my conclusi ons would be the same if I 
used a lower cutoff, such as $1 billion in assets, or a more detailed definition of community banks, such as that developed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) a few years ago.
1  As always, the views I express her e today are my own.  
I will start by discussing figures  showing the number of community banks 
operating in the U nited S tates over the past 20 years.  Figure 1 shows the number of 
community banks for each year from 1995 to 2015.  It shows a steady decline i n the 
number of such banks over time.  The rate of decline is considerably steeper in the late 1990s than in the period from 2000 to 2010.  In the past five years, the rate of decrease 
has accelerated somewhat but remains slower than that experienced in th e late 1990s.  
Breaking the universe of community banks down into subgroups based on size, 
we can see that the decline in community bank numbers is far from uniform.
2  The 
number of banks with between $1 billion and $10 billion in assets has doubled since 1995 
                                                 
1 The FDIC definition of community banks can be found at 
https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/resources/cbi/report/CBSI -1.pdf  
2 All asset sizes are converted to 2005 dollars, so the changes in size distribution cannot be attributed to 
inflation.   - 3 - 
(figure 2), although such banks still make up a small percentage of all community banks. 
I should note that the growth in this “large community bank” category is greater than that among banks with more than $10 billion in assets, in terms of both the number of banks added to the category and the percentage growth rate.  Banks ranging in size from $300 million to $1 billion have also roughly doubled in number over these past 20 years 
(figure 3).  And the number of banks in the size range from $100 milli on to $300 million 
in assets has declined by only a very modest percentage since 1995 (figure 4). 
However, the picture for banks with less than $100 million in assets is very 
different from the picture for larger banks.  As can be seen in figure 5, the num ber of 
such banking organizations has declined by more than two- thirds since 1995.  As with the 
pattern for all community banks, the decline in the number of these small community banks was steeper in the late 1990s than in later years.  
We can identify  four factors that help to account for  the decrease in the number of 
banks with under $100 million in assets.  Some of this decline reflects the growth of small banks (often de novo banks) out of the smallest size range into larger size categories due to either organic growth or acquisition of another bank.  Indeed, 90 percent of the large drop -off in the number of banks in this size range in  2014 and 
2015 is due to banks moving up into a larger size category.  A number of the smallest banking organizations also disappeared as a result of being merged with or acquired by other banking organizations.  Some of the decline reflects the failures experienced in the Great Recession.  And, finally, there have been few new bank formations in recent years.  
As noted in a 2014 article by McCord and Prescott, a key difference between the 
past few years and the late 1990s is that the recent acceleration in the rate of decrease in  - 4 - 
the number of community banks is due in large part to a decline in new bank charters 
rather than an increase in the annual number of exits.3  This  fact can be seen in figure 6, 
which shows the number of new charters  each year (in blue , with squares  to mark yearly 
values ), the actual annual change in the number of community banks (in green , with 
triangles ), and what the annual change in the number of banks would have been in the 
absence of new entry (in red, with circles ), over the past 20 years.  It is clear from this 
figure  that in the absence of new entry, the annual decline in the number of com munity 
banks between 2000 and 2010 would have been quite similar to what it has been since 2010.  Or, viewed from a different perspective, if entry had remained at more “normal” levels during the past 5 years, the rate of decline in the number of community  banks 
would not have accelerated.  And, since almost all new entrants have less than $100 
million in assets, the decline in the number of banks in this smallest size category would have been much less steep during the past 5 years.   
Research by Adams and  Gramlich that was presented at the 2014 c ommunity 
banking conference and subsequently published in the Review of Industrial Organization 
considers the underlying causes of the virtual absence of new bank formation since 2009.
4  This research suggests that  slow economic growth and low interest rates in the 
post-crisis environment can explain  about 75 percent  of the decline in new bank charters .  
The authors were not able to isolate the effect  of regulatory changes on the rate of new 
bank formation, but note  that regulation may also play a role.

The sharp difference in trends for the number of banks with less than $100 million 
in assets compared with larger community banks naturally leads to the question of 
whether this difference is reflected in basic bank p erformance measures.  I will begin 
with return on assets  (ROA).  Breaking down all community banks into the same size 
categories I used earlier, with the addition of a category for all banks larger than $10 
billion in assets, we find  striking differences in the patterns of bank profitability over 
time (figure 7).  The largest community banks --those with $1 billion to $10 billion in 
assets  (in green , with diamonds to mark yearly values )--followed a pattern similar to that 
of our larges t banks (in black , with crosses ), but with slightly worse results throughout 
the past 20 years.  These large community banks had lower average levels of profitability 
than our largest banks prior to the recent recession, suffered worse losses in 2009, and 
have enjoyed lower levels of earnings since the crisis.  
Banks in the size range from $300 million to $1 billion in assets (in blue , with 
triangles ) have been the most consistently profitable group among community banks, 
although their profit levels still lag those for the largest banks.  These midsize community banks performed as well as banks with $1 billion to $10 billion in assets before the recent recession and remained profitable, on average, even in 2009.   
The story is much the same for banks in the size class from $100 million to 
$300 million in assets (in red , with squares ).  Their profit levels were slightly lower than 
those for larger community banks prior to the crisis, but they performed similarly until 2015, when banks of this size showed a dec line in profits not experienced by any other 
size grouping of community banks.  Time will tell whether this is an anomaly or the beginning of a pattern.   - 6 - 
Looking at the smallest community banks, those with less than $100 million in 
assets, gives some hints for why their numbers have declined.  The average ROA for the 
smallest banks (in purple , with circles ) has been consistently lower than that for the next -
smallest class of banks since 1995.  The already lower level of profits for the smallest banks began t o decline further in 2006.  Since 2009, profits for the smallest banks have 
increased slightly but remain below their levels of profitability prior to the recession and below the ROA levels for larger banks.

Data on nonperforming loans (NPLs) show a mixed  picture .6  A b reakdown of  
community banks by size  indicates that  the ratio of NPLs  to total loans peaked for every 
size category in 2010 (figure 8).  Prior to 2007, the smallest community banks consistently had a higher ratio of NPLs  than did larger community banks; but from 2007 
until 2013, their NPL rate was below that of larger community banks.  In the past two 
years, NPLs  on the balance sheets of the smallest banks have declined more slowly than 
for larger banks so that banks with less than $100 million in assets once again have the highest NPL ratio.  
Let me turn now to consider changes in the number of community banks over the 
past 20 years at a more local level.  For purposes of this discussion, I define local banking 
markets as counties in rural areas and as M etropolitan S tatistical A reas in urban areas.  
                                                 
5 The patterns for return on equity (ROE) are similar to those for ROA, although community banks as a 
whole had negative ROE in both 2009 and 2010.  The largest community banks, with $1 billion to 
$10 billion in assets, suffered much greater negative returns on equity in these years than did smaller 
community banks.  Midsize community banks , with $300 million to $1 billion in assets , fared better than 
their larger and smaller counterparts.  
     The smallest community banks showed an unusual pattern in their ROEs.   (It should be noted that, for 
banks of this size, ROE can be a questionable measure of profitability because such banks tend to be either 
privately held or very thinly traded. )  These banks were in the only size category that did not show a 
negative ROE in 2009, but it was also the only class to show a negative ROE in 2013, and the ROE  for 
these banks has been consistently below that for larger banks since the recession.  
6 NPLs are defined as nonaccr ual loans plus loans that are 90 -plus days past due and still accruing.   - 7 - 
Figure 9  shows those local banking markets in which the number of community banks 
decreased over the 20 years from 1995 to 2015 (in white ) and those markets in which the 
number of community banks increased or stayed constant (in blue ).  As you can see, there 
are markets in every state where the number of community banks has declined.  
However, there also are markets in every state where community banks have maintained or increased their presence.  In fact, the number of local markets that saw their population of community banks hold constant or increase between 1995 and 2015 was more than double the number of local  markets that experienced a decline in the number of 
community banks over this period.  And, perhaps surprisingly, the share of rural markets experiencing a decrease in the number of community banks (about 32 percent) was slightly lower than the share of u rban markets facing such a decline (about 35 percent).  
As we saw,  the vast majority of the decline in the number of community banks 
involved banks with less than $100 million in assets.  This next figure ( figure 10 ) shows 
changes in the number of banks in this smallest size category together with changes in the number of all community banks.  The local markets that are shaded in dark blue are those 
where both the number of banks with less than $100 million in assets and the number of all community banks de clined between 1995 and 2015.  The light- blue markets are those 
where the total number of community banks remained constant or increased despite a decline in the number of banks in the smallest size category.  There are just over twice as many markets shad ed in light blue as there are shaded in dark blue , indicating that in two -
thirds of the markets where the number of very small community banks declined, the number of community banks overall did not decline.  Markets in white  are those where  - 8 - 
the number of banks in the smallest category increased or remained unchanged over the 
past 20 years.  
This examination of the geographic patterns of changes in the population of 
community banks has shown that most markets in the United States have maintained or increased  their numbers of community banks over the past 20 years.  Those local markets 
that have lost community banks have not been concentrated in any particular section of the country, and urban markets have been slightly  more likely to lose community banks 
over the past 20 years than rural areas.  
One might ask, what factors have led some markets to lose community banks 
while others gained community banks or saw no change?  Because of the importance of community banks as a source of small business lending and other retail services, we have explored this question but do not yet have any definitive answers.  We considered the possibility that underlying demographic characteristics were driving the observed 
changes in the number of banks in a local market area.  Perh aps the size of the labor force 
or the population density, the racial and ethnic mix of the population, or changes in any of these factors might explain the outcome.  We also considered whether economic conditions such as the unemployment rate , the median household income , the number of 
business establishments, or changes in any of these measures might be useful in predicting which markets would lose community banks over time.  Taking into account all of these variables in a regression framework did not yie ld much explanatory power.   
This analysis has not led us to a clear story regarding the determinants of changes 
in the number of community banks serving a local market area, but we intend to continue our research efforts and hope that they will ultimately  yield some valuable insights.  W e  - 9 - 
can take some comfort from the fact that the number of local markets that either 
maintained or increased the number of community banks serving their residents and small businesses is much larger than the number of markets  that saw a decline in the number of 
community banks .  That said, we recognize that the loss of community banks may have 
caused some communities to suffer adverse economic consequences . 
So, what do we take away from this review of bank numbers and performa nce?  
First, the decline in the number of community banks is not a recent phenomenon--it has been a constant theme over at least the past 20 years.  Second, it has occurred almost exclusively among the smallest community banks --those with less than $100 million in 
assets.  However, I want to emphasize that the long -trending decline in the number of 
very small community banks does not mean that these banks do not play an important role in our financial system.  Almost all newly chartered banks fall into th is category, and 
many of these banks thrive and, ultimately , outgrow the smallest size category.  Thus, 
banks with less than $100 million in assets should be viewed as a key source of dynamism and competition within the banking sector.  Third, although the  rate of decline 
has accelerated a bit during the past 5 years, that acceleration is largely due to a lack of entry rather than an increased rate of exit.  Fourth, although the lack of entry may be due in part to increased regulatory burden, much of it can be explained by very low interest rates and a post -crisis  expansion that has been slower than usual.  Fifth, at a local level, 
about one -third of markets have seen a decline in the number of community banks over 
the past 20 years, but about two- thirds have seen no change or an increase in the number 
of community banks.  It is unclear what factors explain observed changes in the number 
of community banks at a local market level.   More research is needed on this question.  - 10 - 
I think the key question for policym akers is whether the recent acceleration in the 
rate of decline in the number of small banks is primarily a structural change attributable 
to increasing economies of scale-- or, perhaps more accurately, diseconomies of very 
small scale --or whether recent ef forts by the FDIC and others to encourage more 
chartering of new banks, combined with a return to higher interest rates and stronger economic growth, will mitigate the decline in numbers.  At this point, I think it i s too 
soon to say.  
The Federal Reserve and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors began this 
conference three years ago in order to stimulate research on community banks, with the goal of improving our understanding of their condition and their important contributions to economic growth and pr osperity.  We plan to continue our own research efforts across 
the Federal Reserve System, as well as our efforts, through initiatives such as this conference, to encourage academics to focus their attention on community banks.   
Of course, the Federal Res erve’s support for community banks goes well beyond 
research.  One of the clearest lessons from our most recent  recession is that , when it 
comes to  bank regulation and supervision, one size does not fit all.  As we seek to  
promote safety and soundness and ensure consumer compliance, we increasingly tailor rules and supervisory approaches to the differing risks posed by institutions  of different 
size and complexity .  This way,  we can achieve our aims without creating undue 
regulatory burden.    The Federal R eserve is committed to this approach to community 
bank oversight and to ensuring that new and existing regulations are not unduly burdensome for community banks. In addition to fulfilling this commitment, the Federal 
Reserve and other federal banking agenc ies have launched a review to identify banking  - 11 - 
regulations that are outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome, as required by the 
Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act.    
The Federal Reserve has taken some concrete steps to provide burden relief by 
publishing a streamlined Call Report for non- complex community banks, e xtend ing the 
examination cycle for banks with $1 billion or less in total assets , increas ing the threshold 
for the Small B ank H olding C ompany  Policy Statement to $1 billion and expanding the 
scope to include savings and loan holding companies .  In addition, we have efforts 
underway to reduce burden associated with our real estate appraisal requirements, to simplify the regulatory capital requirement for community banks, to encourage resource sharing among community banks to help manage their BSA and AML obligations, and to use Call Report data and forward- looking risk analytics to identify high- risk community 
banks, which would allow us to focus our supervisory response on the areas of highest risk and reduce the regulatory burden on low -risk community banks.  We will continue to 
work with bankers and the other banking regulators to ensure that we reduce burde n and 
complexity in our regulations and guidance.        
  Another way that we further our understanding is by talking to the bankers 
themselves.  The entire Board of Governors meets twice a year with the Community Depository Institutions Advisory Council, which includes representatives of community banks, thrifts, and credit unions in each of the 12 Federal Reserve Districts.  Individual 
Governors also take advantage of opportunities to meet with community bankers from 
time to time.  I speak regularly to bank executives, including those who run smaller 
institutions.  I  find these types of conversations --with people who live and work in the 
world outside the Capital Beltway and far from Wall Street--to be particularly  - 12 - 
enlightening.  In addition, I hope  that some of the conversations here today among 
researchers, bankers, and bank regulators will continue, leading to benefits to all in the 
form of more informative research, better design and implementation of regulatory policy, and enhanced community bank performance . Trends in Community Bank

Washington, D.C.  
       
October 25, 2023 
  
I am delighted and honored to introduce Professor Alan Blinder as this year’s 
winner of the Daniel Patrick Moynihan Prize.    
The Moynihan Prize honors those who “champion the use of informed judgment 
to advance the public good.”1  In the field of economics, I can think of no better example 
of such a champion than Alan Blinder.  The very heart of his distinguished career has 
been advancing the use of informed judgment in economic policymaking.   
As Alan has observed, in our political economy, there exist t wo neighboring 
tribes, sharing common interests but separated by cultural and language barriers.  On one side of the border there is the academy, particularly social scientists, who work to assess the costs and benefits of public policies, actual and possi ble.  On the other side are the 
policymakers, including elected officials as well as those who work at various government agencies.  Folks on the academy side generally feel that the policymakers would make better policy if they paid more attention to acad emic work.  Meanwhile, 
policymakers often look across that divide desiring that academic work pay more attention to the practical realities of policymaking.   
Like Moynihan himself, Alan Blinder is that rare person who both transcends this 
barrier and reco gnizes its significance.  A s he made clear to the Senate during his 
confirmation process to become Vice Chair  of the Federal Reserve, “Academic 
economists are often aloof from practical policy debates; but I have not been.”

has regularly called o n his academic colleagues to “train their powerful tools on real -
world issues instead of chasing intellectual will -o’-the-wisps.”3  
Alan’s academic work is a testimony to those principles.  He has used the 
powerful tools of economics to address the critic al policy topics of our time.  From his 
pathbreaking work on the great stagflation of the 1970s ,4 through his analysis of central 
bank structure, independence, and communications ,5 to his research on financial crises6 
and his masterful summary of the pa st 60 years of monetary and fiscal policy,7 Alan’s 
work is always policy relevant, rigorous, and crystal clear.  
Alan has also been a top monetary policymaker, in addition to advising 
Presidents, Fed Chairs and numerous other officials on both a formal and informal basis.  
But his work goes beyond his excellence as a member of both the academic and 
policymaker tribes.   
Alan’s life’s work has featured a continuous effort to foster greater understanding 
and communication across the divide.  To illustrate this, I will close with two broad 
categories of engagement that have been hallmarks of Alan’s career.  
The first is Alan’s work addressing the academy –policy divide itself.  Two of his 
books, published 30 years apart, show his career -long focus answering this question:

N.J.:  Princeton University Press).   - 3 - 
How can social science, and particularly economics, support good public policies?  First 
in Hard  Heads, Soft Hearts , he articulate s the problems these groups have in 
communicating and working with each other.  He provides guidance and examples of 
success and failure while advocating an economic philosophy that combines  “profound 
respect for the virtues of free markets with profound concern for those the market leaves behind.”
8  He restated that philosophy more recently in Advice and Dissent , in which he 
catalogs his own experience trying to bridge that gap, outlines what that experience has taught him, and gives additional direction “toward more useful economic  advice met by 
less political dissent.”
9   
The second category is Alan’s engagement with the broader American public.  He 
is the rare public figure who speaks fluently in both English and “ Economics ,” and b oth 
audiences rightly consider him a native speaker.  A natural te acher, Alan has 
communicat ed clearly and accessibly over the years with a wide range of audiences, 
bringing to bear facts, insights and lessons from history and policymaking.  His countless newspaper columns, broadcast interviews and many books do more tha n clearly explain 
the economic issues of the day.  Through them, Alan has managed to make economics both fascinating and essential to an extraordinarily wide audience.  That is doubtless due in part to his habit of serving up the substance with a healthy dose of humor.  Whether it is an academic article on the economics of brushing teeth ,

critical issues for central bankers with the help of Gilbert and Sullivan ,11 or the general 
wit on display in any of his regular columns, Alan’s style enlivens even  the most 
technical and dry topics.  Moynihan surely would have approved.    
A personal note.  Over the span of four decades, and counting, for many 
policymakers from d ifferent sectors of the political forest, and for me personally, Alan 
Blinder has been a friend, a source of good advice, a supporter, an insightful critic, a role 
model, and a wise soul.  In short, a mensch.  His published writings as an academic economis t are essential to our work, and beyond count.  The same is true of the 
friendships he has forged.  He embodies so much of what many policymakers aspire to in his commitment to hard -headed analysis, tempered by a soft heart, that supports good 
public polic y that benefits all Americans.

Opening Remarks  
   
by 
 
Jerome H. Powell  
 
Chair   
 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  
 
at 
 
“A Look at the Past, Present, and Future,” a conference celebrating  
the Centennial of the Division of Research and Statistics  
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  
 
Washington, D.C.  
       
November 8, 2023  
  
Thank you, Stacey, for the chance to be part of this celebration .  It is great to be 
here to honor the Division of Research and Statistics (R&S) and humbling to see so many 
Fed people who served the institution over long and distinguished careers and have returned for this great occasion.  The Fed is one of those places where you can work for a decade or so and still feel like a newbie.  
For those listening outside this room, I will briefly outline R&S’ s responsibilities.  
A large part of  the division, along with other  divisions at the Board, is engaged in 
producing the  Tealbook, which contains the staff’s forecast for the U.S. economy, as well 
as a great deal of data and analysis on financial and economic issues, and which is delivered to the F ederal Open M arket C ommittee  (FOMC) before our meeting s.   
Outside of the FOMC meeting cycle, R&S deploys its experts wherever they are 
needed across the Board, providing crucial inputs to work on financial stability, bank 
merger analysis, and many other topics.  R&S is also an ongoing source of specialized information for policymakers .  If Board member s have questions  about even the most 
arcane workings of some aspect of the economy, they  can send an email and , in no time , 
be sitting down with some of the best -informed experts on that subject .  Much of the 
time, these a re R&S economists.  D uring the pandemic, when questions  arose about how 
the computer chip shortage was affecting auto production or how  businesses were 
responding to the backlog at U.S. ports, R&S gave  detailed briefings on these topics.  
Among its other activities, the Board of Governors is one of the  world’s  most productive 
economic research institution s, and a large share of that work takes place inside R&S, 
supporting our mission of pr omoting a healthy economy and a strong and stable financial 
system.     - 2 - 
I’ve spoken about research—now let me turn to statistics.  In addition to the 
gathering of data from many sources outside the Federal Reserve, R&S is itself the 
source for some of the most important data on the economy and the financial syste m.  
Our c onsumer credit data provide financial markets and the public with a vital indicator 
of the strength of household spending and balance sheets .  Each month, the Industrial 
Production report  gives us insights into how well certain sectors of the economy , 
especially in the manufacturing realm,  are operating .  R&S is also responsible for  the 
Financial Accounts of the United States, a quarterly  compendium of assets, liabilities , 
and transactions for different segments of the economy.  And every three years, R&S conducts the Survey of Consumer Finances, a premier source of detail and insights about how households are faring in the economy.  T he latest survey was published just last 
month.  T hese and other data series produced by R&S are a significant public service.  
I want to focus in more detail on the forecast, perhaps the most important of 
R&S’s roles.  The U .S. economy baseline forecast  produced by R&S , along with the 
simulation of a half -dozen plausible alternative paths, constitutes the largest part of the 
essential bedrock that enables our pursuit of our dual -mandate goals .  
Some people are attracted to extremely challenging tasks.  The people of R&S are 
those people, having chosen such a task in  forecasting the path of the U.S. economy, 
eight times a year for FOMC meetings, with ongoing updates between meetings.  They do this work on the biggest stage and with the highest stakes, knowing that the economy very often surprises us.    
Several qualities are required to do this work well .  - 3 - 
I will start with an intense commitment.  The work requires everything you have 
to give.  You have to love this work to do it well. 
The job also requires integrity—policymakers count on R&S to give us their best 
thinking, not shading the results for any reason.  
Regular forecasting also demands  a systematic approach and a high degree of 
intellectual rigor.  Ask Stacey and her colleagues to explain a certain aspect of the 
forecast, and you will find that they have a clear explanation grounded in a rigorous 
framework.   
That intellectual rigor has to be combined with flexibility and agility.  Economic 
models can do a reasonably good job of capturing the working of the economy over past decades.  Of course, even with state- of-the-art models  and even  in relatively calm times, 
the economy frequently surprises us.  But our economy is flexible and dynamic, and subject at times to unpredictable shocks, such as a global financial crisis or a pandemic.  
At those times, forecasters have to think outside the models. 
This work also takes large doses of courage and humility.  And , finally, judgment. 
To complement this rigorous process, there has to be good judgment, based on knowledge and experience.  
Perhaps the most important legacy of the past century for the Division of 
Research and Statistics is the resilience, the creativity, the energy, the rigor , and the 
commitment with which R&S has risen to the many challenges it and our country ha ve 
faced in that span of history.  On behalf of the Board and the FOMC, thank you for that, and hearty congratulations on your first 100 years of service to the public.        ",2023-11-08,powell

“Designing Resilient Monetary Policy Frameworks for the Future”  
 
a symposium  sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  
 
Jackson Hole, Wyoming  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
August 26 , 2016 
  
The Global Financial Crisis and Great Recession posed daunting new challenges 
for central banks around the world and spurred innovations  in the design, 
implementation, and communication of monetary policy.  With the U.S. economy now 
nearing the Federal Reserve’s statutory goals of maximum employment and price 
stabilit y, this conference provides a timely opportunity to consider how the lessons we 
learned are likely to influence the conduct of monetary policy in the future.  
The theme of th e conference, “Designing Resilient Monetary Policy Frameworks 
for the Future,” enco mpasses many aspect s of monetary policy, from the nitty -gritty 
details  of implement ing policy in financial markets to broader questions about how policy 
affects the economy.  Within the operational realm, key choice s include the selection  of 
policy instrum ents, the specific markets in which the central bank participates, and the 
size and structure of the central bank’s balance sheet.  These topics  are of great 
importance to the Federal Reserve .  As noted in the minutes of last month’s F ederal Open 
Market Committee (FOMC)  meeting, we are  studying many issues related to  policy 
implementation, research which ultimately will inform the FOMC’s views on how to 
most effectively conduct  monetary policy in the years ahead.  I expect that t he work 
discussed at this co nference will make valuable contribution s to the understanding of 
many of these important issues.   
My focus  today will be the policy tool s that are needed to ensure that we have a 
resilient monetary policy framework.  In particular, I will focus on whether our existing 
tools are adequate to respond to future economic downturns.  As I will argue, one lesson 
from the crisis is that our pre -crisis toolkit was inadequate to address th e range of 
economic circumstances that we face d.  Looking ahead, we will likely need to retain  - 2 - 
many of the monetary policy tools that were developed to promote recovery from the 
crisis .  In addition, policymakers inside and outside the Fed may wish at some  point to 
consider additional options to  secure  a strong  and resilient economy.  But b efore I turn to 
these longer -run issues, I  would  like to offer a few remarks on the near -term outlook for 
the U.S. economy and the potential implications for monetary pol icy. 
Current Economic Situation and Outlook   
U.S. e conomic activity continues to expand, led by solid growth in household 
spending .  But  business investment remains soft and subdued foreign demand and the 
appreciation of the dollar since mid -2014 continue  to restrain exports.  While economic 
growth has not been rapid, it has been sufficient to generate further improvement in the 
labor market.  Smoothing through the monthly ups and downs, job gains averaged 
190,000 per month over the past three months.  Alt hough the unemployment rate has 
remained fairly steady this year, near 5 percent, broader measures of labor utilization 
have improved.  Inflation has continued to run below the FOMC’s objective of 2 percent, 
reflect ing in part  the transitory effects of ear lier declines in energy and import prices.  
Looking ahead, the FOMC expect s moderate growth in real gross domestic 
product (GDP), additional strengthening in the labor market, and inflation rising to 
2 percent over the next few years.  Based on this economi c outlook, the FOMC continues 
to anticipate that  gradual increases in the federal funds rate will be appropriate over time 
to achieve and sustain employment  and inflation near our statutory objectives .  Indeed, in 
light of the continued solid performance of the labor market and our outlook for 
economic activity and inflation, I believe the case for an increase in the federal funds rate  - 3 - 
has strengthened in recent months .  Of course, our decisions always depend on the degree 
to wh ich incoming data continues to confirm the Committee’s outlook.  
And, a s ever, the economic outlook is uncertain , and so monetary policy is not on 
a preset course .  Our ability to predict how the federal funds rate will evolve over time is 
quite limited bec ause monetary policy will need to respond to whatever disturbances may 
buffet the economy.  In addition, the level of short -term interest rates consistent with the 
dual mandate varies over time in response to shifts in underlying economic conditions 
that a re often evident only in hindsight.  For these reasons, the range of reasonably likely 
outcomes for the federal funds rate is quite wide --a point illustrated by figure 1 in your 
handout.  The line in the center is the median path for the federal funds rate  based on the 
FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections in June.1  The shaded region, which is based 
on the historical accuracy of private and government forecasters, shows a 70 percent 
probability  that the federal funds rate will be between 0 and 3 -1/4 perce nt at the end of

range is that the economy is frequently buffeted by shocks and thus rarely  evolves as 
predict ed.  When shocks occur and the economic outlook changes, monetary policy needs

to adjust.   What we do know, however, is that we want a policy toolkit that will allow us 
to respond to a wide range of possible conditions.  
The Pre -Crisis Toolkit   
Prior to the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy toolkit was 
simple but effective  in the circumstances that then prevailed .  Our main tool consisted of 
open market operations to manage the amount of reserve  balances available to  the 
banking sector .3  These operations, in turn, influence d the interest rate in the federal 
funds market, where banks experiencing reserve shortfalls could borrow from banks with 
excess reserves.  Before the onset of the crisis , the volume of reserves was  generally 
small --only about $45  billion or so .4  Thus, even small open market operations could 
have a significant effect on the federal funds rate.  Changes in the federal funds rate 
would then be transmitted to other short -term interest rates, affect ing longer -term interest 
rates  and overall financial conditions  and hence inflation and economic activity.  This 
simple, light -touch system allowed the Federal Reserve to operate with a relatively small 
balance sheet --less than $1 trillion before the crisis --the size of which was largely 
determined by the  need to supp ly enough U.S. currency to meet demand.5    
The global financial crisis revealed  two main shortcomings of this simple toolkit.  
The first was an inability to control the federal funds rate once reserves were  no longer 
                                                 
3 Open  market operations at the time were primarily repurchase ag reements based on Treasury securities, 
with primary dealers as counterparties.  
4 Reserves of depository institutions include vault  cash and balances maintained with Federal Reserve 
Banks.  Excess reserves are the reserves held over and above required reserves.  See the Board’s webpage 
“Reserve Requirements” at www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reservereq.htm .  
5 Prior to the financial crisis, the size of the Fed’s balance sheet was about $900 billion.  Assets consisted 
almost entirely of Treasury securities.  Liabilities included currency held by the publi c and a relatively 
small volume of reserve balances.  For more on the Fed’s balance sheet, see 
www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_fedsbalancesheet.htm .  - 5 - 
relatively scarce.  Starting in late 2 007, faced with  acute financial market distress , the 
Federal Reserve created programs to keep credit flowing to households and businesses.6  
The loans extended under those programs help ed stabilize the financial system .  But the 
additional reserves created  by these programs, if left unchecked, would have pu shed 
down the federal funds rate, driving it well below the FOMC’s target.  To prevent such an 
outcome , the Federal Reserve took several steps to offset (or sterilize) the effect of its 
liquidity and credit operations  on reserves .7  By the fall of 2008, however, the reserve 
effects of our  liquidity and credit  programs threatened to becom e too large to sterilize via 
asset sales and other existing tools.  Without sufficient sterilization ca pacity, the quantity 
of reserves increased to a point that the Federal Reserve had difficulty maintaining 
effective control over the federal funds rate.   
Of course, by the end of 2008, stabilizing the federal funds rate at a level 
materially above zero wa s not an immediate concern  because the economy clearly needed 
very low short -term interest rates .  Faced with a steep rise in unemployment and 
declining inflation, the FOMC lowered its target for the federal funds rate to near zero, a 
reduction of roughly 5 percentage points over the previous year  and a half .  Nonetheless , 
a variety of policy benc hmarks would, at least in hindsight, have called for pus hing the

to the financial crisis, see www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_crisisresponse.htm  on the Board’s 
website .    
7 Reserves were initially taken out of the  banking system by not reinvesting principal payments from 
maturing securities and later by selling portions of securities hol dings.  In September 2008, the Department 
of the Treasury announced the temporary Supplementary Financing Program, in which the proceeds of a 
series of Treasury bill auctions, separate from Treasury ’s routine borrowing, were maintained in an account 
at the  Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The funds in this account served to drain reserves from the 
banking system.   - 6 - 
federal funds rate well below  zero during the economic downturn.8  That doing so was 
impossible highlights the second serious limitation of our pre-crisis policy toolkit:  its 
inability to generate substantially more accommodation than could be  provided by a near -
zero federal funds rate .  
Our Expanded Toolkit   
To address the challenges posed by the financial crisis and the subsequent severe 
recession and slow recovery, the Federal Reserve significantly expanded its monetary 
policy  toolkit .  In 2006 , the Congress had approved plans to allow the Fed, beginning in 
2011, to pay interest on banks’ reserve balances.9  In the fall of 2008, the Congress 
moved up the effective date of this authority to October 2008.  That authority was 
essential.  Paying interest on reserve balances enables the Fed to break the strong link 
between the quantity of reserves  and the level of the federal funds rate and , in turn, 
allows the Federal Reserve to control short -term interest  rates when reserves are plentiful .  
In particular, once economic conditions warrant a higher level for market  interest rates, 
the Federal Reserve could raise the interest rate paid on excess reserves --the IOER rate.  
                                                 
8 Consider the following policy rule:  R(t) = R* + π(t) + 0.5[π(t) -π*]-2.0[U(t) -U*], where R is the federal 
funds rate, R* is the longer -run nor mal value of the federal funds rate adjusted for inflation, π is the four -
quarter moving average of core PCE inflation, π* is the FOMC’s target for inflation (2 percent), U is the 
unemployment rate, and U* is the longer -run normal rate of unemployment.  Ba sed on the medians of 
FOMC participants’ latest longer -run projections, R* is approximately 1 percent and U* is about 
4.8 percent.  Accordingly, with the unemployment rate climbing to 10 percent and core PCE inflation 
falling to 1 percent in 2009, th is rul e would have prescribed lowering the federal funds rate to minus 
9 percent at the depths of the recession.  In contrast, the standard Taylor rule, which is half as responsive to 
movements in resource utilization, would have prescribed lowering the federal funds rate to minus 
3-3/4 percent using the same estimates for R* and U*.   The more aggressive rule does a reasonably good 
job of accounting for movements in the federal funds rate in the decade prior to its falling  to its effective 
lower bound in late 200 8, see David Reifschneider (2016), “Gauging the Ability of the FOMC to Respond 
to Future Recessions,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2016 -068 (Washington:  Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, August),  
www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2016/files/2016068pap.pdf .  For more information on the 
standard Taylor rule, see J ohn B. Taylor (1993), “Discretion versus Policy Rules in Practice ,” Carnegie -
Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy , vol. 39 (December), pp. 195 -214. 
9 Paying interest on reserves is a tool commonly used by central banks, including the Bank of England, the 
Bank of Japan, and the European Central Bank.    - 7 - 
A higher IOER rate encourage s banks to raise the interest rates they charge, putting 
upward pressure on market interest rates regardless of the leve l of reserves in the banking 
sector.    
While adjusting the IOER rate is an effective way to move market interest rates 
when reserves are plentiful, federal funds have generally traded below this rate .  This 
relative softness of the federal funds rate refl ects, in part, the fact that only depository 
institutions can earn  the IOER rate .  To put a more effective floor under short -term 
interest rates , the Federal Reserve created supplementary tools to be used as needed .  For 
instance,  the overnight reverse rep urchase agreement (ON RRP) facility is available to a 
variety of counterparties, including eligible money market funds, government -sponsored 
enterprises, broker -dealers, and depository institutions.  Through it, eligible 
counterparties may invest funds  overnight with the Fed eral Reserve  at a rate determined 
by the FOMC .  Similar to the payment of IOER , the ON RRP facility discourage s 
participating institutions from lending at a rate substantially below that offered by the 
Fed.10   
Our current toolkit proved effective last December.  In an environment of 
superabundant reserves , the FOMC raised the effective federal funds rate --that is, the 
weighted average rate on federal funds transactions among participants in th at market --by 
the d esired amount,  and we have since maintained the federal funds rate in its target 
range .  
                                                 
10 Other tools that could help strengthen the floor under short -term interest rates but are not currently in use 
include the Term Deposit Facility and term reverse repurchase agreements.    - 8 - 
Two other major addition s to the Fed’s toolkit  were large -scale asset purchases 
and increasingly explicit forward guidance.11  Both were used to provid e additional 
mone tary policy accommodation after short -term interest rates fell close to zero .  Our 
purchases of Treasury and mortgage -related securities in the open market pushed down 
longer -term borrowing rates for millions of American families and businesses.  Extended 
forward rate guidance --announcing that we intended to keep short -term interest rates 
lower for long er than might have otherwise been expected --also put significant 
downward pressure on longer -term borrowing rates , as did guidance regarding the size 
and sco pe of our asset purchases .  
In light of the slow ness of the  economic recovery, s ome have questioned the 
effectiveness of  asset purchases and extended forward rate guidance.   But this criticism  
fails to consider  the unusual headwinds the economy faced after the crisis.  Those 
headwinds included substantial household and business  deleveraging, unfavorable 
demand shocks  from abroad , a period of contractionary fiscal policy, and unusually tight 
credit, especially for hou sing.  S tudies  have found that our asset purchase s and extended 
forward rate guidance put appreciable downward pressure on long -term interest rates  and, 
as a result, helped spur growth in demand for goods and services, lower the 
unemployment rate, and prev ent inflation from falling further below our 2 percent 
objective .12  
                                                 
11 Prior to the crisis, the Fed occasionally used forward guidance pertaining to the likely future path of 
interest rates, but that guidance was usually confined to a relatively short time frame.  
12 See, for instance, Joseph Gagnon, Matthew Raskin, Julie Remache, and Brian Sack (2011), “The 
Financial Mark et Effects of the Federal Reserve ’s Large -Scale Asset Purchases ,” International Journal of 
Central Banking , vol. 7 (March), pp. 3 -43, www.ijcb.org/journal/ijcb11q1a1.htm ; and Stefania D ’Amico, 
William English, David López -Salido, and Edward Nelson (2012), “The Federal Reserve ’s Large -Scale 
Asset Purchase Program mes:  Rationale and Effects ,” Economic Journal, vol. 122 (November), pp. F415 -
46.  Moreover, the Federal Reserve ’s forward guidan ce and asset purchase policies have been estimated to  - 9 - 
Two of the F ed’s most important new tools --our authority to pay interest on 
excess reserves and our asset purchases --interacted importantly.  W ithout IOER 
authority, the F ederal Reserve would have been reluctant to buy as many assets as it did  
because of the longer -run implications for controlling the stance of monetary policy .  
While we were buying assets aggressively to help bring the U.S. economy out of a severe 
recession, we also had to  keep in mind whether and how we would be able to remove 
monetary policy accommodation when appropriate.  That issue was particularly relevant 
because we fund our asset purchases through the creation of reserves, and those 
additional reserves would have made it ever more difficult for the pre -crisis toolkit to 
raise short -term interest rates when needed.  
The FOMC  considered removing accommodation by first reducing our asset 
holdings (including through asset sales)  and raising the federal funds rate only af ter our 
balance sheet had contracted  substantially.  But we decided against this approach because 
our ability to predict the effects of changes in the balance sheet on the economy is less 
than that associated with changes in the federal funds rate.  Excessive inflationary 
pressures could arise if assets were  sold too slowly .  Conversely, financial markets and 
the economy could potentially be destabilized if assets were sold too aggressively.  
Indeed, the so -called taper tantrum of 2013 illustrates the difficulty of predicting financial 
market reactions to announcements about the balance sheet.  Given the uncertainty and 
potential costs associated with large -scale asset sales, the FOMC  instead decided to begin 
                                                 
have helped lower unemployment and boost inflation; see Eric M. Engen, Thomas Laubach, and David 
Reifschneider (2015), “The Macroeconomic Effects of the Federal Reserve ’s Unconventional Monetary 
Policie s,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2015 -005 (Washington:  Board of Governors of the 
Federal Reserve System, January) , http://dx.doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2015.005 .  - 10 - 
removing monetary policy accommodation prima rily by adjusting short -term interest 
rates rather than by active ly manag ing its asset holdings.13  That strategy --raising short -
term interest rates once the recovery was sufficiently advanced while maintaining a 
relatively large balance sheet and plentiful  bank reserves --depended on our ability to pay 
interest on excess reserves.    
Where Do We Go from Here?   
What does the future hold for the Fed’s toolkit?  For starters, our ability to use 
interest on reserves is likely to play a key role for years to come.   In part, this reflects the 
outlook for our balance sheet over the next few years.  As the FOMC has noted in its 
recent statements, at some point after  the process of  raising the federal funds rate is well 
under way, we will cease or phase out reinvesting  repayments of principal from our 
securities holdings.  Once we stop reinvestment, it should take several years for our asset 
holdings --and the bank reserves used to finance them --to passively decline to a more 
normal level.  But even after the volume of r eserves falls substantially, IOER will still be 
important as a contingency tool, because we may need to purchase assets during future 
recessions to supplement conventional interest rate reductions.14  Forecasts now show the 
                                                 
13 The FOMC’s  “Policy Normaliza tion Principles and Plans ” call for reducing the Federal Reserve’s 
securities holdings in a “gradual and predictable manner primarily by ceasing to reinvest repayments of 
principal on securities held in the [System Open Market Account]” (Board of Governors  of the Federal 
Reserve System (2014), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement on Policy Normalization Principles and 
Plans,” press release, September 17, second bullet, 
www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20140917c.htm ). Consistent with those plans, the 
Federal Open Market Committee anticipates that it will maintain its current reinvestment strategy “until 
normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way” (for instance, see Board of Governors 
of the  Federal Reserve System (2015), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,” press release, 
December 16, paragraph 5, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/2015121 6a.htm . 
14 If the FOMC w ere to again increase the size of the balance sheet markedly in response to a future 
recession, then the ability to pay interest on reserves could  be critical during the subsequent recovery period 
to help control short -term interest rates while the balance sheet remains elevated.  Beyond this motivation 
for retaining IOER, the ability to pay interest on reserves could also be important to the operation of any 
special liquidity and credit facilities that might be created to deal with systemic disruptions to the financial  - 11 - 
federal funds rate settling at ab out 3 percent in the longer run.15  In contrast, the federal 
funds rate averaged more than 7  percent between 1965 and 2000 .  Thus, we expect to 
have less scope for interest rate cuts  than we have had historically .     
In part, current expectations for a low  future federal funds rate reflect the 
FOMC’s success in stabilizing inflation at around 2 percent --a rate much lower than rates 
that prevail ed during the 1970s and 1980s.  Another key factor is the marked decline over 
the past decade, both here and abroad, in the long -run neutral real rate of interest --that is, 
the inflation -adjusted short -term interest  rate consistent with keeping output at its  
potential on average over time.16  Several developments could have contributed to this 
apparent decline, including slower growth in the working -age populations of many 
countries, smaller productivity gains in the advanced economies, a decreased propensity 
to spend in the wake of the financial crises around the world since the late 1990s, and 
                                                 
system  during a future emergency.  In particular, such facilities could significantly expand the supply of 
reserves , which would be problematic if the FOMC wished to keep short -term interest rates from falling to 
zero.    
15 In the Blue Chip Financial Indicators  survey released on June 1, 2016, the consensus forecast for the 
longer-run level of the federal funds rate was 3.2 percent.  FOMC participants in June 2016 generally 
anticipated a slightly lower longer -run level, i n that the median of their individual forecasts was 3 percent 
(see table 1 of the June 2016 SEP, available at 
www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20160615ep .htm).  The latest long -run forecast  from 
the Administration  (www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2016/assets/16msr.pdf ) is also 
close to 3 percent, as was the projection made by the Congressional Bu dget Office earlier in the year  (see 
www.cbo.gov/about/products/budget_economic_data ). 
16 Updated estimates from the model deve loped by Laubach and Williams (2003) indicate that the real 
long-run neutral or “equilibrium” short -term interest rate in the United States is currently about 
2-1/2 percentage points lower than it was on average in the 1980s and 1990s (see Thomas Laubach a nd 
John C. Williams (2003), “Measuring the Natural Rate of Interest,” Review of Economics and Statistics,  
vol. 85 (November ), pp. 1063 -70; updated estimates are available at www.frbsf.org/economic -
research/economists/john -williams/Laubach_Williams_updated_estimates.xlsx .)  In addition, Holston, 
Laubach, and Williams (2016) find  significant but somewhat smaller declines in equilibrium rates  for the 
euro area, Canada , and the United Kin gdom (see Kathryn Holston, Thomas Laubach, and John C. Williams 
(2016), “Measuring the Natural Rate of Interest:  International Trends and Determinants,” Working Paper 
2016 -11 (San Francisco:  Federal Reserve B ank of San Francisco, June), www.frbsf.org/economic -

perhaps a paucity of attractive capital projects worldwide.17  Although these factors may 
help explain why bond yields have fallen to such low levels here and abroad, ou r 
understanding of the forces driving long -run trends in interest rates is nevertheless 
limited, and thus all predictions in this area are highly uncertain .18   
Would an average federal funds rate of about 3 percent impair the Fed’s ability to 
fight recessi ons?  Based on the F OMC ’s behavior in past recessions, one might think that 
such a low interest rate could substantially impair policy effectiveness.  As shown in the 
first column of the table in the handout, during the past nine recessions , the FOMC cut 
the federal funds rate by amounts ranging from about 3 pe rcentage points to more than 
10 percentage points.  On average, the FOMC reduced rates by about 5 -1/2 percentage 
points, which seems to suggest that the FOMC would face a shortfall of about 
2-1/2 percentage points for dealing with an average -sized recession.  But this simple 
comparison exaggerates the limitations on policy created by the zero lower bound.  As 
shown in the second column, the federal funds rate at the start of the past seven 
recessions w as appreciably above the level consistent with the economy operating at 
potential in the longer run.  In most cases, t his tighter-than-normal  stance of policy before

rates in the United States and other advanced economies, see Lawrence H. Summers (2014), “U.S.

the recession appears to have reflected some combination of initially higher -than-normal 
labor utilization and elevated inflation pressures.  As a result, a large portion of the rate 
cuts that subsequently occurred during  these recessions represent ed the undoing of the 
earlier tight  stance  of monetary policy.  Of course, this situation could oc cur again in the 
future.  But if it did, the federal funds rate at the onset of the recession would be well 
above its normal level, and the FOMC would be able to cut short -term interest rates by 
substantially more than 3 percentage points.   
A recent paper  takes a different approach to assessing the FOMC’s ability to 
respond to future recessions by using simulations of the FRB/US model.19  This analysis 
begins by asking how the economy would respond to a set of highly adverse shocks if 
policymakers followed a fairly aggressive policy rule, hypothetically assuming that they 
can cut the federal funds rate without limit.20  It then imposes the zero lower bound and 
asks whether some combination of forward guidance and asset purchases would be 
sufficient to generat e economic conditions at least as good as those that occur under the 
                                                 
19 FRB/US model simulations have several advantages for analyzing this issue.  For one, the model’s 
structure allows the public’s expectations for interest rates, in flation, and other factors to take full account 
of the implications of the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates, changes in future monetary 
policy as signaled by forward guidance, and asset purchases.  In addition, the model incorporates the low  
responsiveness of inflation to movements in resource utilization seen in recent years as well as the effects 
of asset purchases on term premiums, and thus a variety of longer -term interest rates, equity prices, and the 
foreign exchange value of the dollar .  For a further discussion about the advantages (and possible 
disadvantages) of using the FRB/US model to study this issue, see Reifschneider, “Gauging the Ability of 
the FOMC to Respond to Future Recessions,“ in note 8.  
20 The aggressive rule is R(t) = 1. 0 + π(t) + 0.5 [π(t) -2] - 2.0 [U(t)  - 4.8], where R is the federal funds rate, 
π is the four -quarter moving average of core PCE inflation, and U is the unemployment rate  [Note:  On 
August 30, 2016, a typo in the equation for the aggressive rule was corrected to change “[4.8  - U(t)]” to 
“[U(t) - 4.8]” ].  Note that baseline values of the equilibrium real rate, the natural rate of unemployment, and 
the target rate of inflation used in the simulation analysis --1.0 percent, 4.8 percent, and 2.0 percen t, 
respectively --are consistent with the medians of the latest long -run projections of individual FOMC 
participants.  As discussed by Taylor (1999), this rule appears to do a good job in stabilizing real activity 
and inflation in a wide range of economic m odels ( see John B. Taylor (1999), “Introduction,” in John B. 
Taylor, ed., Monetary Policy Rules  (Chicago:  University of Chicago Press), pp. 1 -14).  - 14 - 
hypothetical unconstrained policy.  In general, the study concludes that, even if the 
average level of the federal funds rate in the future is only 3 percent, these new tools 
should be su fficient unless the recession were to be unusually severe and persistent.   
Figure 2 in your handout illustrates this point.  It shows simulated paths for 
interest rates, the unemployment rate, and inflation under three different monetary policy 
responses --the aggressive rule in the absence of the zero lower bound constraint, the 
constrained aggressive rule, and the constrained aggressive rule combined with $2  trillion 
in asset purchases and guidance that the federal funds rate will depart from the rule by 
staying lower for longer.21  As the red dashed line shows, the federal funds rate would fall 
far below zero if policy w ere unconstrained, thereby causing long -term interest rates to 
fall sharply.i  But despite the lower bound, asset purchases and forward guidance can 
push long -term interest rates even lower on average than in the unconstrained case  
(especially when adjusted for inflation) by reducing term premiums and increasing the 
downward pressure on the expected average valu e of future short -term interest rates.  
Thus, the use of such tools could result in even better outcomes for unemployment and 
inflation  on average .   
Of course, this analysis could be too optimistic.  For one, the FRB/US simulations 
may overstate the effec tiveness of forward guidance and asset purchases, particularly in 
an environment where long -term interest rates are also likely to be unusually low.22  In 
                                                 
21 The forward guidance is provided at the start of the recession and has three components.  First, the 
feder al funds rate will be lowered to zero more quickly than prescribed by the rule.  Second, the federal 
funds rate will remain at zero as long as the unemployment rate is greater than 5 percent.  And , finally, that 
after the initial increase in the federal fu nds rate,  policymakers will proceed gradually in return ing to the 
prescriptions of the policy rule.    
22 As shown in figure 2, the 10 -year Treasury yield in the simulation starts out at just over 4 percent, well 
below its level pre -crisis, suggesting that there may be less room to push down long -term interest rates in 
the future than in the past.  Another potential source of overstatement could be the FRB/US assumption that  - 15 - 
addition, policymakers could have less ability to cut short -term interest rates in the future 
than the  simulations assume.  By some calculations, the real neutral rate is currently close 
to zero, and it could remain at this low level if we were to continue to see slow 
productivity growth and high global saving.23  If so, then the average level of the nomina l 
federal funds rate down the road might turn out to be only 2 percent, implying that asset 
purchases and forward guidance might have to be pushed to extremes to compensate.24  
Moreover, relying too heavily on these nontraditional tools could have unintende d 
consequences.  For example, if future policymakers responded to a severe recession by 
announcing their intention to keep the federal funds rate near zero for a very long time 
after the economy had substantially recovered and followed through on that guid ance, 
then they might  inadvertently encourage excessive risk -taking and so undermine financial 
stability.      
Finally, the simulation analysis certainly overstates the FOMC’s current  ability to 
respond to a recession, given that there is little scope to cu t the federal funds rate at the 
                                                 
changes in long -term interest rates, whether driven by shifts in term premiums or sh ifts in the expected path 
of short -term interest rates, have the same influence on real activity, as there is some empirical evidence 
that the estimated sensitivity of spending to movements in term premiums alone may be relatively small; 
see Michael T. Kil ey (2014), “ The Aggregate Demand Effects of Short - and Long -Term Interest Rates,” 
International Journal of Central Banking,  vol. 10 (December), pp. 69 -104, 
www.ijcb.org/journal/ijcb14q4a3.pdf .  On the other hand, the effectiveness of forward guidance in the 
FRB/US model is materially less than it is in some other models, implying that the FRB/US simulation 
results could potentially understate the stimulus provided by the announcement of a lowe r-for-longer 
policy.  See Hess Chung (2015), “The Effects of Forward Guidance in Three Macro Models,” FEDS Notes 
(Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February 26), 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/notes/feds -notes/2015/effects -of-forward -guidance -in-three -
macro -models -20150226.html . 
23 In principle, the federal funds rate in the longer run could  also turn out to be lower than currently 
predicted if inflation were to remain persistently below 2 percent.  However, because a higher rate of 
inflation can arguably be achieved over time through a sufficiently tight labor market, this ri sk seems low 
to me as long as the Federal Reserve is committed to achieving its inflation objective.  
24 In the simulations reported by Reifschneider, “Gauging the Ability of the FOMC to Respond to Future 
Recessions,” in note 8 , overcoming the effects of the  zero lower bound during a severe recession would 
require about $4 trillion in asset purchases and pledging to stay low for even longer  if the average future 
level of the federal funds rate is only 2 percent.   - 16 - 
moment.  But that does not mean that the Federal Reserve would be unable to provide 
appreciable accommodation should the ongoing expansion falter in the near term.  In 
addition to taking the federal funds rate back down to nearly zero, the FOMC could 
resume asset purchases and announce its intention to keep the federal funds rate at this 
level  until conditions had improved markedly --although with long -term interest rates 
already quite low, the net stimulus that would result m ight be somewhat reduced . 
Despite these caveats, I expect that forward guidance and asset purchases will 
remain important components of the Fed’s policy toolkit.  In addition, it is critical that the 
Federal Reserve and other supervisory agencies continue to do all they can to ensure a 
strong and resilient financial system.  That said, these tools are not a panacea, and future 
policymakers could find  that the y are not adequate to deal with deep and prolonged 
economic downturns.   For these reasons, policymak ers and society more broadly may 
want to explore additional options  for helping to foster a strong economy . 
On the monetary policy  side, future policymakers might  choose to  consider some 
additional tools that have been employed by other central banks, though adding them to 
our toolkit would require a very careful weighing of costs and benefits  and, in some 
cases, could require legislation .  For example, future policymakers may wish to explore 
the possibility of purchasing a broader range of asset s.  Beyond that, some observers  have 
suggested raising the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation objective or implementing policy 
through alternative monetary policy frameworks, such as price -level or nominal GDP 
targeting.  I should stress , however,  that the FOMC is not ac tively considering these 
additional tools and policy frameworks , although they are important subjects for research.   - 17 - 
Beyond monetary policy, fiscal policy has traditionally played an important role 
in dealing with severe economic downturn s.  A wide range o f possible fiscal policy tools 
and approaches could enhance the cyclical stability of the economy.25  For example, steps 
could be taken to increase the effectiveness of the automatic stabilizers , and some 
economists have proposed  that greater fiscal support  could be usefully provided to state 
and local governments during recessions.  As always , it would be important to ensure that 
any fiscal policy changes did not compromise long -run fiscal sustainability.     
Finally, and most ambitiously, as a society we s hould explore ways to raise 
productivity growth .  Stronger productivity growth would tend to raise the average level 
of interest rates and therefore would provide the Federal Reserve with greater scope to 
ease monetary policy in the event of a recession.  But m ore importantly, stronger 
productivity growth would enhance Americans’ living standards.  Though outside the 
narrow field of monetary policy, m any possibilities in this arena are worth considering, 
including improving our educational system and invest ing more in worker training; 
promoting capital investment and research spending, both private and public; and looking 
for ways to reduce regulatory burdens while protecting important economic, financial, 
and social goals.   
Conclusion

Although  fiscal policies and structural reforms can play an important role in 
strengthening  the U.S. economy, my primary message today is that I expect monetary 
policy will continue to play a vital part in promoting a stable and healthy economy.  New 
policy tools, which h elped the Federal Reserve respond to the financial crisis and Great 
Recession, are likely to remain useful in dealing with  future downturns .  Additional tools 
may be needed and will be the subject of research and debate.  But even if average  
interest rates  remain lower than in the past, I believe  that monetary policy  will, under 
most conditions,  be able to respond effectively .

This year’s symposium topic is “Challenges for Monetary Policy, ” and for the 
Federal Reserve those challenges flow from our mandate to foster maximum employment 
and price stability.  From this perspective, our economy is now in a favorable place, and I 
will describe how we are working to sustain these conditions in the  face of significant 
risks we have been monitoring.   
The current U.S. expansion has entered its 11th year and is now the longest on 
record.1  The unemployment rate has fallen steadily throughout the expansion and has 
been near half -century lows since earl y 2018.  But that rate alone does not fully capture 
the benefits of this historically strong job market.  Labor force participation by people in 
their prime working years has been rising.  While unemployment for minorities generally 
remains higher than for  the workforce as a whole, the rate for African  Americans, at 
6 percent, is the lowest since the government began tracking it in 1972.  For the past few 
years, wages have been increasing the most for people at the lower end of the wage scale.  
People who l ive and work in low - and middle -income communities tell us that this job 
market is the best anyone can recall.  We increasingly hear reports that employers are 
training workers who lack required skills, adapting jobs to the needs of employees with 
family r esponsibilities, and offering second chances to people who need one.  
Inflation has been surprisingly stable during the expansion:   not falling much 
when the economy was weak and not rising much as the expansion gained strength.  
Inflation ran close to our  symmetric 2  percent objective for most of last year but has been 
running somewhat below 2 percent this year.   
                                                   
1 The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) has classified business cycle turning points back to 
1854 (see https://www.nber.org/cycles.html ).  - 2 - 
Thus, after a decade of progress toward maximum employment and price 
stability, the economy is close to both goals.  Our challenge now is to do what monetary 
policy can do to sustain the expansion so that the benefits of the strong jobs market 
extend to more of those still left behind, and so that inflation is centered firmly around 
2 percent.   
Today I will explore what history tells us about sus taining long, st eady  
expansions.  A good place to start is with the passage of the Employment Act of 1946, 
which stated that it is the “continuing policy and responsibility of the Federal 
Government . . . to promote maximum employment, production, and purc hasing power.”2  
Some version of these goals has been in place ever since.  I will divide the history since 
World War II into three eras organized around some well -known “Greats.”  The first era 
comprises the post war years through the Great Inflation.  The  second era brought the 
Great Moderation but  ended in the Great Recession.  The third era is still under  way, and 
time will tell what “Greats ” may emerge.   
Each era presents a key question for the Fed and for society more generally.  The 
first era raises t he question whether a central bank can resist the temptations that led to 
the Great Inflation.  The second era raises the question whether long expansions 
supported by better monetary policy inevitably lead to destabilizing financial excesses 
like those se en in the Great Moderation.  The third era confronts us with the question of

   A modified version of those goals formally became the Fed’s dual mandate in 1977.  For further

how best to promote sustained prosperity in a world of slow global growth, low inflation, 
and low interest rates.  Near the end of my remarks, I will discuss the current context, and  
the ways these questions  are shaping policy.    
Era I, 19 50–1982:  Policy Breeds Macroeconomic Instability and the Great Inflation  
The late 1940s were a period of adjustment to a peacetime economy.  As the 
1940s turned to the 1950s, the state of knowledge about how best to promote 
macroeconomic stability was limited.   The 1950s and early 1960s saw the economy 
oscillating sharply between recession and growth above 6 percent ( figure 1, panel A).  
Three expansions and contractions came in quick succe ssion.  With the benefit of 
hindsight, the lack of stability is generally attributed to “stop and go” stabilization policy, 
as monetary and fiscal authorities grappled with how best to modulate the use of their 
blunt but powerful tools.3   
Beginning in the  mid-1960s, “stop and go” policy gave way to “too much go and 
not enough stop” —not enough, that is, to quell rising inflation pressures.  Both inflation 
and inflation expectations ratcheted upward through four expansions until the Fed , under 
Chairman Paul Volcker , engineered a definitive stop in the early 1980s ( figure 1, 
panel  C).  Each of the expansions in the Great Inflation period ended with monetary 
policy tightening in response to rising inflation.   
Policymakers came out of the Great Inflation era with a clear understanding that it 
was essential to anchor inflation expectations at some low level.  But many believed that 
                                                   
3 Romer and Romer (2002) document that the Federal Open Market Committee understood the essence of 
sound policy.  Nonetheless, as Nelson (2013) discusses, many authors argue that the way those principles 
were applied contributed to the fluctuat ions of the time.   - 4 - 
central bankers would find it difficult to ignore the temptation of short -term emp loyment 
gains at the cost of higher inflation  down the road.4   
Era II, 1983 through 2009: the Great Moderation and Great Recession  
As the second era began, inflation was falling, and it continued to fall for about a 
decade ( figure 2, panel C).  In 1993, c ore inflation, which omits the volatile food and 
energy components, first fell below 2.5 percent, and has since remained in the narrow 
range of 0.9 percent to 2.5 percent.5  Greater success on price stability came with greater 
success on employment.  Expansions in this era were longer and more stable than before 
(figure 2, panel A).  The era saw two of the three longest U.S. expansions up to that point 
in history.6   
Anchored inflation expectations helped make this win-win outcome possible, by 
giving the Fe d latitude to support employment when necessary without destabilizing 
inflation.  The Fed was cutting, not raising, rates in the months prior to the end of the first 
two expansions in this era, and the ensuing recessions were mild by historical standards.  
And twice during the long expansion of the 1990s, the Federal Open Market Committee 
(FOMC ) eased policy in response to threats to growth.  In 1995, responding to evidence 
                                                   
4 As discussed by Faust (1996), the structure of FOMC governance was motivated by the traditional view 
that governments are tempted to resort to inflation in times of stress.  With the post –World War II emphasis 
on full employment and understanding the role of inflation expectations, this tendency was reformulated as 
seeking near -term gains on employment at the cost of long -term inflation (Kydland and Prescott, 1977;  
Barro and Gordon, 1983).  
5 Overall inflation, which is the subject of our symmetric 2 percent objective, has been somewhat more 
volatile, but it is neither practical nor wise to try to smooth purely transitory inflation fluctuations.  As such 
transitory fluctuations are frequently driven by volatile food and energy prices, I  am citing the stability of 
core inflation  on a four -quarter basis  as a proxy for Fed performance in achieving the relevant sense of 
stability.  
6 Analysts debate the role that monetary policy and other factors, such as luck and structural change in the 
economy, played in bringing about the Great Moderation.  For example, Ahmed, Levin, and Wilson (2004) 
find an important role for luck.  Stock and Watson (2003) attribute much of the change to an unexplained 
improvement in the tradeoff between inflation and output variability.  Like Bernanke (2004), I believe that 
better policy was an important factor behind the better outcomes, perhaps allowing other factors to show 
through.    - 5 - 
of slowing in the United States and abroad, the FOMC reduced the federal funds rate over 
a few months.  In 1998, the Russian debt default and the related collapse of the hedge 
fund Long- Term Capital Management rocked financial markets that were already fragile 
from the Asian financial crisis.  Given the risks posed to the U.S. economy, the FOMC 
again lowered the federal funds rate over a period of months until events quieted.  The 
10-year expansion weathered both events with no discernible inflation cost.7  
By the turn of the century, it was beginning to look like financial excesses and 
global events would pose the main threats to stability in this new era rather than 
overheating and rising inflation.  The collapse of the tech stock bubble in 2000 and the 
September 11, 2001,  terrorist attacks played key roles in precipitating a slowdown tha t 
turned into a recession.8  And the next expansion, as we are all painfully aware, ended 
with the collapse of a housing bubble and the Global Financial Crisis.  Thus, this second 
era provided good reason for optimism about the Fed’s ability to deliver sta ble inflation , 
but also raised a question about whether long expansions inevitably  lead to destabilizing 
financial excesses.  
Era III, 20 10 and After:  Monetary Policy and the Emerging New Normal   
The third era began in 2010 as the recovery from the Great Recession was taking 
hold.   My focus in discussing this era will be on a “new normal” that is becoming 
apparent in the wake of the crisis.  I will fast -forward past the early years of the 
expansion and pick up the story in December 2015.9  The unempl oyment ra te had fallen 
                                                   
7 Indeed, as I noted at this symposium last year, inflation ran surprisingly low in the second half of the 
1990s (Powell, 2018).  
8 This was an odd recession to classify.  The collapse of the tech bubble was followed by several quarters of 
generally slow positive growth.  Regarding declaring the 2001 recession, the NBER Business Cycle Dati ng 
Committee stated, “ Before the [September 11] attacks, it is possible that the decline in the economy would 
have been too mild to qualify as a recession” (NBER, 2001, p. 8).  
9 Ben Bernanke (2012) surveyed the early years of the recovery at this symposiu m in 2012.  - 6 - 
from a peak of 10 percent to 5 percent, roughly equal to the median FOMC participant’s 
estimate of the natural rate of unemployment at the time.  At this point, the Committee 
decided that it was prudent to begin gradually raising the  federal funds rate based on the 
closely  monitored premise that the increasingly healthy economy called for more -normal 
interest rates.  The premise was generally borne out:  Growth from the end of 2015 to the 
end of 2018 averaged 2.5 percent, a bit above the 2.2 percent rate over the previous five 
years ( figure 2 , panel  A).  The unemployment rate fell below 4 percent, and inflation 
moved up and remained close to our 2 percent objective through much of 2018 (figure 2,  
panels  B and  C).   
That brings us to 2 019.  Before turning to issues occupying center stage at 
present, I want to address  a long -running issue that I discussed here last year:  tracking 
the “stars”  that serve as guideposts for monetary policy.10  These include u *, the natural 
rate of unemployme nt, and r *, the neutral real rate of interest.  Unlike celestial stars, 
these stars move unpredictably and cannot be directly observed.  We must judge their 
locations as best we can based on incoming data  and then add an element of risk 
management to be ab le to use them as guides.  
Since 2012, declining unemployment has had surprisingly little effect on inflation, 
prompting a steady decline in estimates of u * (figure  3).11  Standard estimates of r * have 
declined between 2  and 3 percentage points over the past two decades.  Some argue that 
the effective decline is even larger.12 Incorporating a lower value of u * into policymaking 
                                                   
10 Powell (2018). 
11 The fact that inflation did not react much to changing unemployment also led some to reassess other 
structural features such as the slope of the Phillips curve.  
12 As discussed in Rachel and Summers (2019), many factors combine to determine the normal growth rate 
of the economy and r*.  Persistent movements in longer -term interest rates in a stable inflation environment 
are one indicator of r* movements.   - 7 - 
does not require a significant change in our approach.  The significant fall in r *, however, 
may demand more fundamental change.  A lower r * combined with low inflation means 
that interest rates will run, on average, significantly closer to their effective lower bound.   
The key question raised by this era, then, is how we can best support maximum 
employment and price stability in a world with a low neutral interest rate .   
Current Policy and the Three Key Questions  
Let me turn now  to the current implications for monetary policy of the questions 
raised by these three eras.   The first era raised the question of whether the Fed can avoi d 
excessive inflation.  Inflation has averaged less than 2 percent over the past 25 years, and 
low inflation has been the main concern for the past decade.  Low inflation seems to be 
the problem of this era, not high inflation.  Nonetheless, in the unlikel y event that signs of 
too-high inflation return, we have proven tools to address such a situation.  
The second era’s question —whether long expansions inevitably breed financial 
excesses —is a challenging and timely one.   Hyman Minsky long argued that, as an  
expansion continues and memories of the previous downturn fade, financial risk 
management deteriorates and risks are increasingly underappreciated.13  This observation 
has spurred much discussion.  A t the end of the day, we cannot prevent people from 
findi ng ways to take excessive financial risks.  But we can work to make sure that they 
bear the costs of their decisions, and that the financial system as a whole continues to 
function effectively.  Since the crisis, Congress, the Fed, and other regulatory aut horities 
here and around the world have taken substantial steps to achieve these goals.  Banks and 
other key institutions have significantly more capital and more stable funding than before 
                                                   
13 See, for example, Minsky (1991).   - 8 - 
the crisis.  We comprehensively review financial stability every q uarter and release our 
assessments twice a year to highlight areas of concern and allow oversight of our efforts.  
We have not seen unsustainable borrowing, financial booms, or other excesses of the sort 
that occurred at times during the Great Moderation, and I continue to judge overall 
financial stability risks to be moderate.  But we remain vigilant.   
That leaves the third question of how, in this low r * world, the Fed can best 
support the economy.  A low neutral interest rate presents both near -term and  longer -term 
challenges.  I will begin with the current context.  Because today’s setting is both 
challenging and unique in many ways, it may be  useful to lay out some general principles 
for assessing and implementing appropriate policy and to describe how  we have been 
applying those principles.   
Through the FOMC’s setting of the federal funds rate target range and our 
communications about the likely path forward  for policy and  the economy, we seek to 
influence broader financial conditions to promote maxim um employment and price 
stability.  In forming judgments about the appropriate stance of policy, the Committee 
digests a broad range of data and other information to assess the current state of the 
economy, the most likely outlook for the future, and meani ngful risks to that outlook.  
Because the most important effects of monetary policy are felt with uncertain lags of a 
year or more, the Committee must attempt to look through what may be passing 
developments and focus on things that seem likely to affect t he outlook over time or that 
pose a material risk of doing so.  Risk management enters our decisionmaking because of 
both the uncertainty about the effects of recent developments and the uncertainty we face 
regarding structural aspects of the economy, incl uding the natural rate of unemployment  - 9 - 
and the neutral rate of interest.  It will at times be appropriate for us to tilt policy one way 
or the other because of  prominent risks.  Finally, we have a responsibility to explain what 
we are doing and why we are doing it so the American people and their elected 
representatives in Congress can provide oversight and hold us accountable.   
We have much experience in addressing typical macroeconomic developments 
under this framework.  But fitting trade policy uncertainty  into this framework is a new 
challenge.  Setting trade policy is the business of Congress and the Administration, not 
that of the Fed.  Our assignment is to use monetary policy to foster our statutory goals.  In 
principle, anything that affects  the outlook for employment and inflation could also affect 
the appropriate stance of monetary policy, and t hat could include uncertainty about trade 
policy.  There are, however, no recent precedents to guide any policy response to the 
current situation.  Moreover, while monetary policy is a powerful tool that works to 
support consumer spending, business investment, and public confidence, it cannot 
provide a settled rulebook for international trade.  We can, however, try to look through 
what may be passing events, focus on how trade developments are affecting the outlook, 
and adjust policy to promote our objectives.  
This approach is illustrated by the way incoming data have shaped the likely path 
of policy this year.  The outlook for the U.S. economy since t he start of the year has 
continued to be a favorable one.  Business investment and manufacturing have weakened, 
but s olid job growth and rising wages have been driving robust consumption and 
supporting moderate growth overall.   
As the year has progressed,  we have been monitoring three factors  that are 
weighing on this favorable outlook : slowing global growth,  trade policy uncertainty,  and  - 10 - 
muted inflation .  The global growth outlook has been deteriorating since the middle of 
last year.  Trade policy uncerta inty seems to be playing a role in the global slowdown and 
in weak manufacturing and capital spending in the United States.  Inflation fell below our 
objective at the start of the year.   It appears to be moving back up closer to our 
symmetric 2 percent ob jective, but there are concerns about a more prolonged shortfall . 
Committee participants have generally reacted to these developments and the 
risks they pose by shifting down their projections of the appropriate federal funds rate 
path.  Along with July’s rate cut, the shifts in the anticipated path of policy have eased 
financial conditions and help explain why the outlook for inflation and employment 
remain s largely favorable.   
Turning to the current context, we are carefully watching developments as we 
assess their implications for the U.S. outlook and the path of monetary policy.  The three 
weeks since our July FOMC meeting have been eventful, beginning with the 
announcement of new tariffs on imports from China.  We have seen further evidence of a 
global  slowdown, notably in Germany and China.  Geopolitical events have been much in 
the news, including the growing possibility of a hard Brexit, rising tensions in Hong 
Kong, and the dissolution of the Italian government.  Financial markets have reacted 
stron gly to this complex, turbulent picture.  Equity markets have been volatile.  Long-
term bond rates around the world have moved down sharply to near post -crisis lows.  
Meanwhile, the U.S. economy has continued to perform well overall, driven by consumer 
spending.  Job creation has slowed from last year’s pace but is still above overall labor 
force growth.  I nflation seems to be moving up closer to 2 percent .  Based on our 
assessment of the implications of these developments, we will act as appropriate to  - 11 - 
sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 
2 percent objective.  
The Three Questions in the Longer Run  
Looking back over the three eras, monetary policy has evolved to address new 
challenges as they have arisen.  The infl ation targeting regime that emerged after the 
Great Inflation has led to vastly improved outcomes for employment and price stability 
around the world.  One result has been much longer expansions, which often brought 
with them t he buildup of financial risk.   This new pattern has led us to understand that 
assuring financial stability over time requires much greater resilience in our financial 
system, particularly for our largest, most complex banks.    
As we look back over the decade since the end of the financial crisis, we can 
again see fundamental economic changes that call for a reassessment of our policy 
framework.  The current era has been characterized by much lower neutral interest rates, 
disinflationary pressures, and slower growth.  We face heightened  risks of lengthy, 
difficult-to -escape periods in which our policy interest rate is pinned near zero.  To 
address this new normal, we are conducting a public review of our monetary policy 
strategy, tools, and communications —the first of its kind for the Fe deral Reserve.  We 
are evaluating the pros and cons of strategies that aim to reverse past misses of our 
inflation objective.  We are examining the monetary policy tools we have used both in 
calm times and in crisis, and we are asking whether we should exp and our toolkit.  In 
addition,  we are looking at how we might improve the communication of our policy 
framework.  -12 -
Public engagement, unprecedented in scope for the Fed, is at the heart of this 
effort.  Through Fed Listens events live -streamed on the internet, we are hearing a 
diverse range of perspectives not only from academic experts, but also from 
representatives of consumer, labor, business, community, and other groups.  We have begun a series of FOMC meetings at which we will discuss these questi ons.  We will 
continue reporting on our discussions in the FOMC minutes and share our conclusions when we finish the review next year.  
I will conclude by saying that we are deeply committed to fulfilling our mandate 
in this challenging era, and I look forward to the valuable insights that will, I am confident, be shared at this symposium.  -13 -

Town Hall Meeting with Soldiers and Their Families 
 
Fort Bliss, Texas 
 
      
November 10, 2011  It is an honor and a privilege for me to  join the men and women of Fort Bliss 
today.  As someone who puts a high value on pub lic service, I want to thank the soldiers 
here for their service to our country and for helping to make the world a safer place.  I 
admire your professionalism and dedication.  I want to thank your family members as 
well; servicemembers could not achieve what they do without the support and sacrifices 
of their families.  You should all be proud of what you have accomplished and what you 
stand for.  You may be wondering why the Chairman of  the Federal Reserve would travel to 
Texas to speak at a military base.  I meet with groups with a wide range of backgrounds 
and perspectives on our economy to listen and learn, as well as to  explain what the 
Federal Reserve is doing to try to improve our economic situation.  I’m here because the 
men and women in military service, like a ll Americans, are profoundly affected by the 
economic challenges our nation has faced these past several years.  Your hometowns may 
be struggling with foreclosures.  You may ha ve had difficulty getting a loan to buy a car 
or a house.  You may have family members who have had trouble finding employment in 
a tough job market.  You may be worried a bout your own job prospects when the time 
comes for you to leave the military.  So this morning I thought I’d first say a few words about what the Federal Reserve is doing to  help strengthen our economy and increase 
economic opportunity.  I also want to make sure you are aw are of some of the special financial 
protections for people in the military.  Just this Tuesday I met with Holly Petraeus, head of the Office of Servicemembers Affairs in the new Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau.  Ms. Petraeus and I share a common commitment to ensuring that the men and - 2 - 
 
women who protect the security of our country  are themselves protected from predatory 
lending and other abusive financial practices.  I will also share a few thoughts about what 
each of you can do to give yourself the best  shot at a promising financial future. 
Federal Reserve Efforts to Improve the Economy’s Performance 
 At the Federal Reserve, we are worki ng hard--both as central bankers and as 
financial regulators--to help restore our nation’s prosperity.  In 2008 and early 2009, the 
world suffered the worst financial crisis sin ce the Great Depression, a crisis which, had it 
been left unchecked, would have resulte d in a global financial meltdown and an 
economic collapse.  Working with policymakers around the world, the Federal Reserve acted creatively and forcefully to help st abilize the financial system and halt the 
economic slide.  Our economy has been growi ng and adding jobs for more than two years 
now.  But for a lot of people,  I know, it doesn’t feel like the recession ever ended.  The 
unemployment rate remains painfully high, and more than two-fifths of the unemployed 
have been out of work for longer than six months, by far the highest ratio since World 
War II.  These problems are very serious, and we at the Federal Reserve have been focusing intently on supporting job creation.  Supporting job creati on is half of our 
marching orders, so to speak; the other half is  controlling inflation.  Or, in the language 
of the law that sets the mandate for monetary  policy, the Federal Re serve is required to 
seek both maximum employment and price stability.   
We pursue those two important goals by infl uencing the level of interest rates and 
other financial conditions.  My colleagues and I on the Federal Reserve’s monetary 
policymaking committee equate price stability with  inflation being at 2 percent or a little 
less.  That rate is low enough that people  and businesses can make financial decisions - 3 - 
 
without having to worry too much about rising costs, but high enough to keep the 
economy away from deflation--falling wage s and prices--which is both a cause and a 
symptom of an extremely weak economy.  A lthough spikes in oil and food prices, and 
other transitory factors, pushe d inflation up earlier this ye ar, inflation appears to be 
moderating, and we expect, based on the best in formation that we have today, that it will 
remain reasonably close to our objective of 2 percent or a bit less for the foreseeable 
future. 
In the longer term, monetary policy is th e main determinant of inflation, and so 
Federal Reserve policymakers have consider able latitude to choose our longer-term 
inflation goal.  In contrast, “maximum em ployment” depends on ma ny factors ou tside of 
the Federal Reserve’s control, such as th e skills of the workforce and the pace of 
technological innovation.  Right now, my colleagues on the Fed’s policymaking 
committee estimate that the U.S. economy c ould sustain an unemployment rate of 
somewhere between 5 and 6 percent without ge nerating a buildup of inflation pressures.  
But, regardless of whether the sustainable ra te is 5 or 6 percent, with unemployment 
currently at 9 percent, our economy is certainly falling far short of maximum 
employment.  That high unemployment rate is  why the Federal Reserve is focusing its 
monetary policy at strengthening the recove ry and job creation, in cluding keeping short-
term interest rates near zero and longer-term ra tes, such as mortgage rates, at the lowest 
levels in decades.  Keeping borrowing cost s very low supports consumer purchases of 
houses, cars, and other goods and services, as well as business investment in new 
equipment, software, and facilities.  Over time, greater demand on the part of households 
and businesses leads to increased economic activity and employment. - 4 - 
 
 Like other central banks around the wo rld, one way in which we have put 
downward pressure on longer-term interest rates is by purchasi ng high-quality, longer-
term securities in the open ma rket--specifically, in our case,  U.S. government securities 
and federally backed mortgage securities.  It is important to understa nd that this type of 
activity isn’t the same as government spending.  We will sell the secu rities back into the 
market or simply allow them to mature as part of the process of  tightening monetary 
policy when the economy improves.  In the m eantime, we earn intere st on the securities 
we hold.  In fact, the Federal Reserve’s secu rities purchases and ot her actions during and 
after the crisis have had the si de effect of reducing the fede ral budget deficit.  Last year 
and the year before, we returned a total of $125 billion of those earnings to the U.S. 
Treasury, and payments to the Tr easury in the current year wi ll be substantial as well. 
 In addition to our monetary policy role, the Federal Reserve shares responsibility 
with other government agencies for re gulating and supervising banks, protecting 
consumers in their financial dealings, and fo stering financial stab ility.  We’re working 
with the other agencies to significantly in crease the financial reserves that banks--
especially the largest banks that can put the financial system at risk--must hold against 
possible losses.  The Fed and the other agenci es also are toughening the restrictions on 
the kinds of financial transactions that ba nks can undertake and working to ensure that 
bankers’ compensation packages do not give them  incentives to take excessive risks.  We 
are requiring banks to compensate and assi st foreclosed-upon homeowners who were 
unfairly treated.  And, importantly, we are wo rking to increase th e resilience of the 
financial system as a whole against financia l and economic shocks that may occur in the 
future.  We are also collaborating with th e Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to - 5 - 
 
implement new rules that will make it easie r for the government to unwind big financial 
firms if they get into trouble, rather than being faced with the terrible choice of either 
bailing them out or risking the collapse of the financial system if they fail. 
 Of course, the Federal Reserve was neve r intended to shoulder the entire burden 
of promoting economic prosperity.  Fostering healthy growth and job creation is a shared 
responsibility of all economic policymakers, in  close cooperation with the private sector.  
Spending and tax policy is of critical importance, but a wi de range of other policies--
pertaining to labor markets, housing, trade, taxation, and regulation, for example--also 
have important roles to play. 
Financial Protections for Servicemembers 
 The Federal Reserve, along with the other agencies, is working hard to enforce an 
array of strengthened regulations  that protect mortgage borr owers, credit card holders, 
and other consumers of financia l services.  The people in this  room should be aware, in 
particular, of the special rights and protect ions provided to military personnel by the 
Servicemembers Civil Relief Act.  The law’ s purpose is to allow servicemembers to 
perform their duties without worry of forecl osure, eviction, and ci vil prosecution--under 
most circumstances.  It caps interest rates for debts incurred before a servicemember 
begins active duty, it prevents creditors fr om foreclosing on a hom e or repossessing a car 
without a court order, it give s servicemembers the option to terminate residential property 
and motor vehicle leases, it stays civil proc eedings while servicem embers are on active 
duty, and it entitles servicemembers to reinst atement of health insurance that was in 
effect before their military service began.  Additionally, Department of Defense rules regulate the terms of certain kinds of high- cost loans to servicemembers and their - 6 - 
 
families, such as payday loans, tax refund anticipation loans, a nd motor vehicle title 
loans.   
Advice on Securing and Promising Financial Future 
 It takes more than rules, however sou nd, and enforcement, however diligent, to 
provide you and your families with a promising fi nancial future.  While I have the pulpit, 
so to speak, permit me to offer three pieces of advice.  First, while you are in the military, 
take advantage of training opportunities.  Many specific skills learned in the military--nursing and healthcare, mechanics, comput er programming, police and security work--
transfer to civilian jobs.  The military also offers training in various life skills.  For 
instance, this morning I visited the Fort B liss Army Community Service training center, 
which offers classes on such financial topics as budgeting, debt management, 
understanding credit, car buying, and protecting agains t identity theft.  More broadly, 
according to a recent study, 80 percent of veterans said their military experience helped 
them get ahead in life.
1  They said the experience help ed them mature, taught them to 
work with others, and built their self-confid ence.  The value of military experience is 
reflected in the fact that the unemployment ra te for veterans tends to be lower than the 
rate for non-veterans.2 
 Second, when you leave the military, take advantage of education benefits for 
veterans.  The Post-9/11 GI Bill pays for tu ition and fees, a monthly housing allowance, 
and books and supplies.  Keep in mind that, on average, compared with high school

(Washington:  PRC, October 5), available at www.pewsocialtrends.org/2011/10/05/war-and-sacrifice-in-
the-post-911-era/1.

(not seasonally adjusted , age 18 and older).  - 7 - 
 
graduates, people with college degrees earn about twice as much  and suffer about half the 
rate of unemployment.3 
 Finally, educate yourself about your own personal finances.  Research by the 
Federal Reserve right here at Fort Bliss shows that financial education can pay off.4  
Beginning in 2003, the Federal Reserve collabo rated with Army Emergency Relief, the 
U.S. Army’s own financial assistance or ganization, to provide a two-day financial 
education course, taught by th e staff of San Diego City College, to younger enlisted 
soldiers--mostly men in their early 20s.  We  surveyed them about their financial history 
and activities at the time of the course, and we did follow-up surveys in 2008 and 2009 of 
both servicemembers who had participated in the course and soldiers who had not.  We 
found that soldiers who had taken the course were more likely to make smart financial 
choices, such as comparison shopping for ma jor purchases, saving for retirement, and 
educating themselves about money manageme nt.  They were less likely to make 
questionable financial decisions , like paying overdraft fees, ta king out car title  loans, and 
continually running credit card balances .  Making good, well-thought-out financial 
decisions can make all the diffe rence to your financial future.  
Conclusion

M
arch 1 1, 2019 Good evening , and thank you for inviting me to speak to you today. 
The National Community Reinvestment Coalition  (NCRC) and its me mber  
organizations are at the forefront of an important conversation about how to ensure that 
low- and moderate-income communities are fairly served by the banking industry.  The 
work that you do to promote access to basic banking services, affordable housing, and 
entrepreneurship opportunities supports the Federal Reserve and other agencies that 
enforce fair l ending l aws.  The large number and  variety of NCRC’s l ocal member 
organizations allow the NCRC to draw a detailed pi cture of  how  the Federal R eserve’s 
policies affect lower -income c ommunities , and we deeply appreciate the information  that 
you share with us and the work that it represents.   
As you know all too well, the current strength of the overall economy masks the 
struggles ma ny individuals a nd families f ace in low er-income urban and rural 
communities.  Low - and moderate -income homeowners s aw their w ealth s tripped aw ay 
as home values droppe d during the financial crisis and have not recovere d as quickly or 
completely as ot hers.  Because home equity has been the main source of wealth among 
low- and moderate- income people, t he crisis de alt a particularly s evere blow  to these 
households.  Most Americans rely on home equity to send their children t o college, invest 
in their own education and training, or start or grow a business.  These aspirations are the 
basis upon which a strong economy is built.  That is why your work as NCRC member 
organizations offering financial counseling, homeownership education, a nd technical 
assistance for  small bus inesses i s as i mportant  as ever.    - 2 - 
When lower -income individuals  and families struggle, it harms their health and 
well-being and also weakens our economy.  When people are connected to education, 
training , and other resources that help them  secure good jobs and other opportunities, 
they are better prepared to care for themselves and their families and contribute to a 
strong economy.   
The Federal Reserve has an extensive community development function, rel ated 
to our responsibilities under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), that promotes 
partnerships between banks and community organizations to address local community 
and economic development needs.  As you know, the CRA requires federal banking 
regulato rs--the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation--to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs 
of the communities they are chartered to serve, including low - and moderate -income 
neigh borhoods.  To complement the work we do with the other regulators to write 
regulations and guidance implementing CRA, the Federal Reserve System’s community 
development staff help banks understand and meet their responsibilities under the law.  
Fed staff m embers also act as liaisons between banks and community organizations to 
identify local community development needs and solutions.   
I know that you all are very interested in the agencies’ activities related to 
possible revisions to the current CRA regula tions.  My colleague, Governor Brainard, 
who represents the Board in our interagency CRA discussions, will be speaking to you 
tomorrow, so I will leave it to her to discuss our efforts in detail.  But I do want to 
express my support for an interagency effo rt to revise the regulations to promote clarity 
and consistency in our evaluations of banks, particularly in light of the changes in the  - 3 - 
way bank products and services are delivered.  We value the CRA’s role in meet ing the 
credit needs of low - and moderate -income neighborhoods and want to be very careful 
that any revisions serve to strengthen the CRA’s purpose.  
I commend your dedication to ensuring that all Americans have fair access to the 
economic opportunities that our nation offers.  I hope you have a productive conference , 
and I look forward to our ongoing conversation about how the Federal Reserve can help.   ",2019-03-11,powell

It is both humbling and a great privilege to be standing here today.1  I am 
particularly honored by the trust and faith that the President has placed in me and by the 
Senate’s quick action in confirming me.  There is no greater honor than public service , as 
Randy, Lael and all of our colleagues here at the Fed would agree.   
The Congress has assigned the Federal Reserve the goals of stable prices and 
maximum employment.  Price stability means that  businesses and households can make 
important decisions without concern for high or volatile inflation.  Maximum 
employment means that those who want a job either have one or can find one reasonably 
quickly.  We also have important responsibilities for the  stability of the financial system 
and for the regulation and supervision of financial institutions, including our largest 
banks.  Through regulation that is both effective and efficient, we seek to ensure that 
credit, which is vital for a healthy economy, will be available to families and businesses 
throughout the business cycle, so they can invest in a brighter future.  
These are awesome responsibilities, and the Congress has wisely entrusted us 
with an important degree of independence so that we  can pursue our monetary policy 
goals without concern for short -term political pressures.  As a public institution, we must 
be transparent about our actions so that the public, through its  elected representatives, can 
hold us accountable.  Over the past 25  years, t he Fed has been a leader among central 
banks in improving transparency.  Today, we are open and accountable .  We strive to 
explain our actions in a way that enhances the public’s understanding of our goals and 
                                                 
1 On Monday, February 5, 2018, Jerome Powell officially took the oath of office as Chairman of the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  (for more information, see the Board’s press release available 
at https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20180205a.htm ).  This February 13 event 
is a ceremonial swearing -in.

methods.  We will continue to pursue ways to improve transparency both in monetary 
policy and in regulation.    
When I joined the Board of Governors in 2012, unemployment was 8.2 percent.   
Many millions of Americans were still suffering from the ravages of the crisis.  Since 
then, monetary policy has continued to support a full recovery in labor markets and a 
return to our inflation target ; we have made great progress in moving much closer to 
those  statutory objectives .  In addition, the financial system is incomparably stronger and 
safer , with much higher capital and liquidity, better risk management , and other 
improvements.     
Much credit for these results should go to Chairman Bernanke and Chair Yellen.  
I am grateful for their leadership and for their example and advice as colleagues.  But  
there is more to the story than successful leadership.  The success of our institution is 
really the result of the way all of us carry out our responsibilities.  We approach every 
issue through a rigorous evaluation of the facts, theory, empirical analysi s and relevant 
research.  We consider a range of external and internal views; our unique institutional 
structure, with a Board of Governors in Washington and 12 Reserve Banks around the 
country, en sures that we will have a diversity of perspectives at all times.  We explain our 
actions to the public . We listen to feedback and give serious consideration to the 
possibility that we might be getting something wrong.  There is great value in having 
thoughtful, well -informed critics.  
While the challenges we face are always evolving, the Fed’s approach will remain 
the same.  Today, the global economy is recovering strongly for the first time in a decade.  
We are in the process of gradually normalizing both interest rate policy and our balance  - 3 - 
sheet with a view to extending the recovery and sustaining the pursuit of our objectives.  
We will also preserve the essential gains in financial regulation while seeking to en sure 
that our policies are as efficient as possible.  We will remain alert to any developing risks 
to financial stability.   
I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to lead the Fed as we face these evolving 
challenges.  I believe that the way we approach our work, the strong values we hold, and 
the dedication to public service I see throughout the Federal  Reserve have been the keys 
to our success.  As Chairman , I will uphold these values and do my very best to further 
our pursuit of something we all seek-- an econom y that works for all American s.  ",2018-02-13,powell

March  8, 2019
  
Thank you for the opportunity to speak here today at the Stanford Institute for 
Economic Policy Research, a place dedicated to scholarship supporting policies to better 
peoples’ lives.  As today is International Women’s Day, I would like to preface my 
remarks by commending the American Economic Association for highlighting the 
diversity challenges of the economics profession and charting a way forward.  D iversity 
is also a priority at the Fed:  I want the Fed to be known within the economics profession 
as a great place for women, minorities, and others of diverse backgrounds to be   
respected, listened to , and happy . 
Just over 10 years ago, the Federal Open  Market Committee (FOMC, or the 
Committee) lowered the federal funds rate close to zero, which we refer to as the 
effective lower bound, or ELB.  Unable to  lower rates further, the Committee turned to 
two novel  tools to promote the recovery.  The first was  forward guidance, which is 
communication about the future path of interest rat es.  The second was large -scale 
purchases of longer -term securities, which became known as quantitative easing, or QE.  
There is a range of views, but most studies have found that these tools provided 
significant support for the recovery.  From the outset, the Committee viewed them as 
extraordinary measures to be unwound, or “normalized,” when conditions ultimately 
warranted.    
Today I will explore some important features of norm alization and then turn to 
what comes after.  In some ways, we are returning to the pre- crisis normal.  In other 
ways, things will be different.  The world has moved on in the last decade, and 
attempting to re -create the past would be neither practical nor  wise.  As normalization 
moves into its later stages, my colleagues and I also believe that this is an important  - 2 - 
moment to take stock of issues raised by the remarkable experiences of the past decade.  
We are therefore conducting a review of the Fed’s monetary policy strategy, tools, and 
communications practices.  I will conclude with some thoughts on the review.  
Balance Sheet Normalization  
Between  December 2008 and October 2014, the Federal Reserve purchased 
$3.7 trillion in longer -term Treasury and agency  securities  in order to support the 
economy both by easing dislocations in market functioning and by driving down longer -
term interest rates.   Consistent with the Committee’s long -stated intention, in October 
2017 we started the  process of balance sheet normalization.  We began gradually 
reducing  the reinvestment of  payments received  as assets matured or were prepaid, 
allowing our holdings to shrink.  The process of reducing the size of the portfolio is now 
well along . 
To frame the discussion of the final s tages of normalization of the size of the 
balance sheet, it is useful to consider what the phrase “normal balance sheet” meant in the 
decades before the crisis.  During that period, the main monetary policy decision for the 
FOMC was choosing a target value  for the federal funds rate.  Subject to that choice, the 
Fed allowed the demand for its liabilities to determine the size of the balance sheet.  This 
is a feature of “normal” that we are returning to:  After normalization, the size of the 
Fed’s balance sh eet will once again be driven by the demand for our liabilities .   
To see what this means, consider figure 1, which shows the size of the Fed’s 
balance sheet through time, as measured by total liabilities.  The values are stated as a 
percentage of the doll ar value of GDP , or gross domestic product .1  Liabilities began to 
                                                 
1 The balance sheet had been steady at around 5 percent of GDP since about 1980, as currency slowly grew 
as a share of GDP, but the increase was offset by a decline in reserves.   - 3 - 
grow sharply at the end of 2008 and continued to increase until the end of 2014.  Since 
that time , liabilities relative to GDP have fallen appreciably.  To understand these 
changes, it is u seful to focus on a snapshot of the balance sheet at three points in time:  
before the crisis , when the balance sheet was at its largest , and a rough projection for the 
end of this year ( table 1).    
In 2006, the dominant liability was currency held by the public, and the dominant 
asset  was Treasury securities.  The Fed’s asset purchase program s increased the balance 
sheet from just below 6 percent to nearly 25 percent of GDP by the end of 2014.2  
Balance sheets must balance, of course, and the Fed issued reserves as payment for the 
assets purchased.  This action pushed reserves to nearly 15 percent of GDP.  
The Committee has long said that the size of the balance sheet will be considered 
normalized when t he balance sheet is once again at the smallest level consistent with 
conducting monetary policy efficiently and effectively.  Just how large that will be is 
uncertain, because we do not yet have a clear sense of the normal level of demand for our 
liabilities.  Current estimates suggest, however, that something in the ballpark of the 
2019:Q4 projected values may be the new normal.  The normalized balance sheet may be 
smaller or larger than that estimate and will grow gradually over time as demand for 
currenc y rises with the economy.  In all plausible cases, the balance sheet will be 
considerably larger than before the crisis.  
To understand the differences between the new and old normal, consider t he final 
column in the  table, which shows  the change, measured in percentage points of GDP, 
between 2006: Q4 and the 2019: Q4 projection in the table .  In this estimate , relative to 
                                                 
2 This size is similar to that  of the balance sheet relative to GDP in the wake of the Great Depression.   - 4 - 
before the crisis, the balance sheet will have grown as a share of GDP by about 
10.6 percentage points.  Bank reserves account for the biggest part of the growth, or 
about 5.6 percent of GDP .  The crisis revealed that banks, especially  the largest and most 
complex , faced much more liquidity risk than had previously been thought .  Because of  
both new liquidity regulations and improved manageme nt, banks now hold much higher 
levels of high -quality liquid assets than before the crisis .  Many banks choose to hold 
reserves as an important part of their strong liquidity position s.  
The rest of the increase in liabilities  is accounted for by three oth er categories .  
First, p ublic currency holdings will have grown by 2.4 percentage points as a share of 
GDP.  Second, t he U.S. Treasury  maintains an account at the Fed, which has been 
running 1.4 percentage points higher as a share of GDP.  And, third, othe r liabilities, 
which are mainly associated with the mechanics of the national and international 
financial system, will have grown by 1.1 percentage points.     
As was the case before the crisis,  the FOMC’s chosen operating regime for 
controlling short -term interest rates also plays a role in determining the appropriate 
quantity of reserves.   In January , the Committee  stated its intention to continue in our 
current regime  in which our main policy rate, the federal funds rate or possibly some 
successor, is he ld within its target range by the interest rates  we set on reserves  and on the 
overnight reverse repo facility.3  In this system, active management of the supply of 
reserves is not required.  Thus, the supply of reserves must be “ample ,” in the sense of 
being sufficient to satisfy reserve demands even in the face of volatility in factors 
                                                 
3 As noted in the minutes of the November 2018 FOMC meeting (see 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20181108.htm ), participants discussed costs 
and benefits of various alternatives to the federal funds rate, such as the overnight bank funding rate, and 
recommended further study of the issue.    - 5 - 
affecting the reserve market.4  Put another way, the qu antity of reserves will equal the 
typical  reserve demands of depositories plus a buffer to allow for reserve market 
fluctuations.  
While the precise level of reserves that will prove ample is uncertain, standard 
projections , such as those in the t able, suggest we could be near that level later this year.  
As we feel our way cautiously to this goal, we will move transparently and predictably in 
order to minimize needless market disruption and risks to our dual -mandate objectives.  
The Committee is now well along in our d iscussions of a plan to conclude balance sheet 
runoff later this year.  Once balance sheet runoff ends, we may , if appropriate, hold the 
size of the balance sheet constant for a time to allow reserves to very gradually decline to 
the desired  level as other  liabilities , such as currency , increase.  We expect to announce 
further details of this plan reasonably soon.   
There is no real precedent for the balance sheet normalization process, and we 
have adapted our approach along the way.  In these final phases, w e will adjust the details 
of our normalization plans if economic  and financial conditions warrant.  After decisions 
regarding the size of the balance sheet have been made, we will turn to remaining issues, 
such as the ultimate maturity composition of the  portfolio.  The Committee has long 
stated that it intends to return to a portfolio consisting primarily of Treasur y securit ies.   
Forward Guidance and the N ormalization of P olicy C ommunication  
The Committee has also been normalizing communication about our policy after a 
decade of forward guidance.  S ince December 2008 , the FOMC’s postmeeting statement 
had contained ever -evolving  forms of guidance about keeping the federal funds rate at the 
                                                 
4 Both supply and demand factors can show large fluctuations.   - 6 - 
ELB or about the gradual pace at which that rate would return to more normal levels.  We 
removed the last elements of this crisis -era guidance in January.5  The federal funds rate 
is now within the broad range of estimates of the neutral rate --the interest rate that tends 
neither to stimulate nor to restrain the econom y.  Committee participants generally agree 
that this policy stance is appropriate to promote our dual mandate of maximum 
employment and price stability.  Future adjustments will depend on what incoming data 
tell us about the baseline outlook and risks to t hat outlook. 
Policy communication will not simply revert to the ways of the early 2000s, 
however, for transparency advances have continued apace since then.  The most 
significant change from the standpoint of forward guidance is that, since January 2012, 
the FOMC’s quarterly Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) has included federal 
funds rate projections reaching up to three years into the future --often referred to as the 
“dot plot.”  Returning to a world of little or no explicit forward guidance in the FO MC’s 
postmeeting statement presents a challenge, for the dot plot has , on occasion , been a 
source of confusion.  Until now, forward guidance in the statement has been a main tool 
for communicating committee intentions and minimizing that confusion.  
For ex ample, in early 2014, the Committee’s intentions were at odds with a 
common misreading of the dots, and Chair Yellen explained, “[O]ne should not look to 
the dot plot, so to speak, as the  primary way in which the Committee wants to or is 
speaking about pol icy to the public at large.  The FOMC statement is the device that the 
                                                 
5 Of course , “patience” as used in the January FOMC statement (see 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20190130a.htm ) might be seen as 
forward guidance.  This type of guidance was used at times before the crisis and may play a role in the 
future.  It is not, however, the explicit guidance about the medium -term level or direction of rates that 
distinguished the crisis -era guidance.   - 7 - 
Committee as a policymaking group uses to express its opinions . . . about the likely path 
of rates.”6  If the Committee remains largely out of the business of explicit forward 
guidance, we will need to find other ways to address the collateral confusion that 
sometimes surrounds the dots.  
As readers of the FOMC minutes will know, at our last meeting in January there 
was an impromptu discussion among some participants of general concerns  about the 
dots.  My own view is that , if properly understood, the dot plot can be a constructive 
element of comprehensive policy communication.  Let me follow my two predecessors as 
Chair in attempting to advance that proper understanding.   
Each particip ant’s dots reflect that participant’s view of the policy that would be 
appropriate in the scenario that he or she sees as most likely.  As someone who has filled 
out an SEP projection 27 times over the last seven years, I can say that there are times 
when I feel that something like the “most likely” scenario I write down is, indeed, 
reasonably likely to happen.  At other times, when uncertainty around the outlook is 
unusually high, I dutifully write down what I see as the appropriate funds rate path in the 
most likely scenario, but I do so aware that this projection may be easily misinterpreted, 
for what is “most likely” may not  be particularly likely.  Very different scenarios may be 
similarly likely.  Further, at times downside risks  may deserve significan t weight in 
policy deliberations.  In short, as Chairman Bernanke explained, the SEP projections are 
merely “inputs ” to policy that do not convey “the risks, the uncertainties, all the things 
that inform our collective judgment.”7

Effectively conveying our views about risks and their role in policy projections 
can be challenging at times, and we are always looking for ways to improve our 
communications.  I have asked the communications subcommittee of the FOMC to 
explore ways in which we can more effectiv ely communicate about the role of the rate 
projections.  For now, let me leave you with a cautionary tale abo ut focusing too much on 
dots.  Here is a picture composed of diffe rent colored dots ( figure 2).  The meaning of it 
is not clear, although if you st are at it long e nough you might see a pattern.  But let’s take 
a step back ( figure  3).  As you can see, if you are too focused on a few dots , you may 
miss the larger picture.  
Delivering on the FOMC’s intention  to ultimately normalize policy continues to 
be a major priority at the Fed.  Normalization is far along, and, considering the 
unprecedented nature of the exercise, it is proceeding smoothly.  I am confident that we 
can effectively manage the remaining stages.  
Beyond Normalization  
We live in a time of intense scrutiny and declining trust in public institutions 
around the world.  At the Fed, we are committed to working hard to build and sustain the 
public’s trust.  T he Fed has special responsibilities in this regard.  Our monetary policy 
independence all ows us to serve the public without regard to short -term political 
considerations, which, as history has shown, is critical for sound monetary policymaking .  
But that precious grant of independence brings with it a special obligation to be open and 
transpar ent, welcoming scrutiny by the public and their elected representatives  in 
Congress .  Only in this way can the Fed maintain its legitimacy in our democratic system.  
                                                 
provide some general information about the balance of risks, but this information is far less complete than 
the detail provided on the modal outlook.   - 9 - 
Among other initiatives , my colleagues and I on the FOMC are undertaking a 
year-long review  of the Federal Reserve ’s monetary policy strategy, tools, and 
communication  practices .  The review will involve a series of “Fed Listens” events 
around the country.  These will include town- hall-style meetings and a conference where 
academic and nonacadem ic experts will share their views.   These events will inform staff 
work and FOMC discussions as we plan for the future.   While th is is the first time the 
Fed has opened itself up in this way, many central banks around the world have 
conducted similar reviews, and our approach builds on their experiences.  
We believe that our existing framework for conducting monetary policy has 
generally served the public well, and the review may or may not produce major changes.  
Consistent with the experience of other  central banks with these reviews, the process is 
more likely to produce evolution rather than revolution.  We seek no changes in law and 
we are not considering fundamental changes in the structure of the Fed, or in the 2 
percent inflation objective.  Whil e there is a high bar for adopting fundamental change, it 
simply seems like good institutional practice to engage broadly with the public as part of 
a comprehensive approach to enhanced transparency and accountability.  
Without ruling out other topics, we have highlighted three questions that seem 
particularly  important at present  (figure 4):    
1.  Can the Federal Reserve best meet its statutory objectives with its 
existing monetary policy strategy, or should it consider strategies that aim to 
reverse past m isses of the inflation objective?   - 10 - 
2.  Are the existing monetary policy tools adequate to achieve and 
maintain maximum employment and price stability, or should the toolkit be 
expanded?  
3.  How can the FOMC’s communication of its policy framework and 
implementation be improved?  
I would like to spend a few minutes discussing  the first topic.  Because interest 
rates around the world have steadily declined for several decades, rates in normal times 
now tend to be much closer to zero than in the past (figure 5) .8  Thus, when a recession 
comes, the Fed is likely to have less capacity to cut interest rates to stimulate the 
economy than in the past, suggesting that trips to the ELB may be more frequent.  The 
post-crisis period has seen many economies around the worl d stuck for an extended 
period at the ELB, with slow growth and inflation well below target.  Persistently weak 
inflation could lead inflation expectations to drift downward, which would imply still 
lower interest rates, leaving even less room for central banks to cut interest rates to 
support t he economy during a downturn.  It is therefore very important for central banks 
to find more effective ways to battle the low -inflation syndrome that seems to accompany 
proximity to the ELB.  
In the late 1990s, motivated by the Japanese experience with deflation  and 
sluggish economic performance , economists began developing the argument that a 
central bank might substantially reduce the economic costs of ELB spell s by adopting  a 
makeup strategy.9  The simplest version goes like this:   If a spell with interest rates near 
                                                 
8 For evidence on the secular decline in interest rates in the United States and abroad, see King and Low 
(2014); Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017); Rachel and Smith (2017); and Brand, Bielecki, and 
Penalver (2018).

the ELB le ads to a persistent  shortfall of inflation relative to the central bank’s goal, once 
the ELB spell ends, the central bank would deliberately make up for th e lost inflation by  
stimulating the economy and temporarily  pushing inflation modestly  above the target .  In 
standard macroeconomic models, if households and businesses are confident that this 
future inflationary stimulus will be coming, that  prospect will promote anticipato ry 
consumption and investment .  This can substantially reduce  the economic costs of ELB 
spells.10  Researchers have suggested many variations on makeup strategies.11 For 
example, the central bank could target average inflation over time, implying that misses  
on either side of the target would be offset.   
By the time of the crisis, there was a well -established body of model -based 
research suggesting that some kind of makeup policy could be beneficial.12  In light of 
this research, one might ask  why the Fed and  other major central banks chose not to 
pursue such a policy.13  The answer lies in the  uncertain distance  between models and 
reality.  For makeup strategies to achieve their stabilizing benefits, households and 
businesses must be quite confident that the “ makeup stimulus” is really coming.  This 
confidence is what prompts them to raise spending and investment in the midst of a 
downturn.  In models, confidence in the policy is merely an assumption.  In practice, 
                                                 
10 Eggertsson and Woodford (2003), for example, show that optimal policy at t he ELB entails a 
commitment to reflate the price level during subsequent economic expansions.  See also Wolman (2005) 
for a discussion of the effectiveness of price- level targeting at the ELB.  For a discussion of the relationship 
between price- level targe ting and average -inflation targeting, see Nessén and Vestin  (2005).  
11 The strategy in Reifschneider and Williams (2 000), for instance, involves a central bank following  a 
Taylor rule modified to make up for shortfalls in policy accommodation during ELB episodes.   Kiley and 
Roberts (2017 ) study a strategy in which policymakers aim for inflation higher than 2 percent during 
normal times to compensate for below -targe t inflation during ELB episodes.  See also Bernanke (2017) for 
a strategy in which low inflati on is made up if it occurs when the federal funds rate is at or near the ELB.  
12 See, for example, English, López -Salido, and Tetlow (2015);  Hebden and López -Salido (2018); 
Bernanke, Kiley, and Roberts (2019); and Mertens and Williams (2 019).  
13 The Bank o f Japan (2016) came closest, announcing in September 2016 an “inflation -overshooting 
commitment” (p. 1).  The commitment did not, however, come with any explicit goal for a degree or 
duration of overshoot.    - 12 - 
when policymakers considered these policies in the wake of the crisis, they had major 
questions about whether a central bank’s promise of good times to come would have 
moved the hearts , minds , and pocketbooks  of the public.  Part of the problem is that when 
the time comes to deliver the inflationary s timulus, that policy is likely to be unpopular --
what is known as the time consistency problem in economics.14   
Experience in the U nited States and around the world suggests that more frequent 
ELB episodes could prove quite costly in the future.  My FOMC colleagues and I believe 
that we have a responsibility to the American people to c onsider policies that might 
promote significan tly better economic outcomes.  Makeup strategies are probably the 
most prominent idea and deserve serious attention.  They are lar gely untried, however, 
and we have reason to question how they would perform in practice.  Before they could 
be successfully implemented, there would have to be widespread societal understanding 
and acceptance-- as I suggested, a high bar for any fundamenta l change.  In this review, 
we seek to start a discussion about makeup strategies and other policies that might 
broadly benefit the American people.   
Conclusion   
Tonight I have focused on policy  normalization and our efforts to engage the 
public in what m ay come after.  Before concluding, I will say a few words on current 
conditions and the outlook.   
                                                 
14 Transcripts of FOMC discussions (see, for example, 2011 transcripts, available at 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomchistorical2011.htm ) reveal that some policymakers  
were dubious about wh ether it would be appropriate or even feasible for a current FOMC to bind a future 
FOMC  to a policy that it might find objectionable , which  contributed to more general doubts over whether 
the policy would be credible.   - 13 - 
Right now, most measures of the health and strength of the labor market look as 
favorable as they have in many decades .  Inflation will probably run a bit be low our 
objective for a time due to declines in energy prices, but those effects are likely to prove 
transitory.  Core inflation, which is often a reliable indicator of where inflation is headed 
over time, is quite close to 2 percent.  Despite this favorable picture, we have seen some 
cross -currents in recent months.  With nothing in the outlook demanding an immediate 
policy response and particularly given muted inflation pressures, the C ommittee has 
adopted a patient, wait -and-see approach to considering a ny alteration in the stance of 
policy.  
Considering monetary  policy more broadly, we are inviting thorough public 
scrutiny and are hoping to foster conversation regarding how the Fed can best exercise 
the precious monetary policy independence we have been g ranted.  Our goal is to 
enhance the public’s trust in the Federal Reserve-- our most valuable asset.

Thank you, President Gayle , and thank you  for the invitation to visit today.   I am 
fortunate to  have been accompanied from Washington by  a very distinguished graduate 
of Spelman College,  Class of 1986 and member of Delta Sigma Theta, my Federal 
Reserve colleague Governor Lisa Cook .  There is no greater testament to Spelman’s 
historic legacy than the achievements of outstanding women like Governor Cook.   One 
part of that legacy is Spelman's tradition of promoting education in STEM (science, 
technology, engineering, and mathematics).  Governor Cook’s research highlights the key 
role of such education in preparing individuals to be inventors a nd innovators who can 
generate ideas that will add to our body of knowledge, increase productivity, and 
generate higher living standards .1  Her work is just one example of how  Spelman women 
continue to make historic contributions in science , the arts,  technology,  medicine , and 
other fields.  
I look forward to our conversation, and I thought I might frame it by talking about 
the Federal Reserve ’s actions to promot e a healthy economy, and how those actions  relate 
to questions students in this audience may be  asking  about the future.  For example, I am 
sure that students  are wondering what kind of a job market and economy you will be 
entering when you complete your education .   
Congress assigned the Fed  the dual mandate goals of maximum employment and 
price stability .  Both goals are essential aspects of a healthy economy.  Congress also 
gave  the Fed a precious grant of independence from direct political control to allow us to 
 
1 See, for example Lisa D. Cook, Janet Gerson, and Jennifer Kuan (2021) , “Closing the Innovation Gap in 
Pink and Black ,” NBER Working Paper Series 29354  (Cambridge, Mass.:  National Bureau of Economic 
Research,  October ), https://www.nber.org/papers/w29354 ; and Lisa D. Cook (2020) , “Policies to Broaden 
Participation in the Innovation Process ,” Policy Proposal 2020 -11 (Washington:   Brookings Institution, The 
Hamilton Project , August) , https://www.hamiltonproject.org/assets/files/Cook_PP_LO_8.13.pdf .  - 2 - 
pursue those goals without consideration of political matters .  Other major central banks 
in democratic societies have similar grants of independence , and this institutional 
arrangement  has a strong track record of producing better policy outcomes for the benefit 
of the public .   
To begin with our  maximum emp loyment goal, I a m glad to say that, by many 
measures, conditions in the labor  market are very strong.  A couple of years ago, a s the 
pandemic receded and the economy reopened, the number of job openings grew to 
greatly exceed the supply of people availabl e to work, leaving a widespread shortage  of 
workers .  Today, labor market conditions remain very strong, and the economy  is 
returning to a better balance between the demand for and supply of workers.  The pace at 
which the economy is creating new jobs remains strong , and has been slowing toward a 
more sustainable level .  That gradual slowing has come  in part due to the efforts of the 
Fed to slow the growth of the economy to help reduce inflation.  After declinin g sharply 
during the pandemic, the supply of workers has bounced back, as people have come back 
into the labor force and as immigration has returned to pre -pandemic levels.  Partly 
because of that labor force  growth , the unemployment rate has edged up over  the second 
half of the year, though it remains historically low at 3.9 percent.  The increase in 
participation has been particularly strong among women in the prime working ages of 25 
to 54 , which surged to an all -time high earlier this year , and which remains well above 
pre-pandemic levels .  Wage growth remains high but has been gradually moving toward 
levels that would be more consistent with 2 percent price inflation over time , and real 
wages are growing again as inflation declines .  - 3 - 
As for price stabili ty, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has a longer -
run goal of 2 percent  inflation .2  After running below 2 percent for over a decade, 
inflation increased sharply in 2021, in the United States and in many other countries 
around the world.  High inflation imposes a significant hardship on all households and is 
especially painful for those le ast able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, 
housing, and transportation.   Beginning in early 2022,  we reacted forcefully, raising our 
policy interest rate and decreasing the size of our balance sheet  to help slow the economy 
and bring down i nflation.  Inflation has declined  to 3 percent over the 12 months  ending 
in October , but after factoring out energy and food prices, which tend to be volatile , what 
we call “core” inflation is still 3.5 percent,  well above our 2 percent objective.  
Over th e six months ending in October, core inflation ran at an annual rate of 2.5 
percent, and while the lower inflation readings of the past few months are welcome, that 
progress must continue if we are to reach our 2 percent objective.  High inflation initiall y 
emerged from a collision between very strong demand and pandemic -constrained supply.  
The normalization  of supply and demand conditions has played a critical role in the 
disinflation so far, as has the substantial tightening of monetary policy and overal l 
financial conditions over the past two years.3  The strong actions we have taken have 
 
2 The F OMC judges that inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price 
index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal 
Reserve’s sta tutory mandate.   For additional information, see the Committee’s Statement on Longer -Run 
Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy , available on the Board’s website at 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf .  
3 While the target range for the policy rate was not i ncreased until March, the anticipated tapering and 
cessation of asset purchases, along with the signals sent in Committee communications, began tightening 
financial conditions during the fourth quarter of 2021.  According to the Federal Reserve Board staff 's 
index measuring U.S. financial conditions through their effect on the outlook for growth , financial 
conditions went from providing a 1.7 percentage point boost to future real gross domestic product growth 
in October 2021 to creating a 0.9 percentage poi nt drag in October 2023 ; updated data and a description of 
the index is provided in Andrea Ajello, Michele Cavallo, Giovanni Favara, William B. Peterman, John W. 
Schindler IV, and Nitish R. Sinha (2023), ""A New Index to Measure U.S. Financial Conditions,"" FEDS

moved our policy rate well into restrictive territory, meaning that tight monetary policy is 
putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.  Monetary policy is 
thought to affect economic conditions with a lag, and the full effects of our tightening 
have likely no t yet been felt.  The forcefulness of our response to inflation also helped 
maintain the Fed’s hard -won credibility, ensuring that the public’s expectations of future 
inflation remain  well-anchored.  Having come so far so quickly, the FOMC is moving 
forwar d carefully, as the risks of under - and over -tightening are becoming more 
balanced.4  
As the demand - and supply -related effects of the pandemic continue to unwind, 
uncertainty about the outlook for the economy is unusually elevated.  Like most 
forecasters , my colleagues and I anticipate that growth in spending and output will slow 
over the next year, as the effects of the pandemic and the reopening fade and as 
restrictive monetary policy weigh s on aggregate demand.5  The FOMC is strongly 
committed to brin ging inflation down to 2 percent over time, and to keeping policy 
restrictive until we are confident that inflation is on a path to that objective.  It would be 
premature to conclude with confidence that we have achieved a sufficiently restrictive 
stance, or to speculate on when policy might ease.  We are prepared to tighten policy 
further if it becomes appropriate to do so.

We are making decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the 
incoming data and their implications for the outlook for  economic activity and inflation, 
as well as the balance of risks.

accomplish.  The bottom line , if you are a student, is that we have made considerable 
progress in reducing high in flation  while maintaining a strong labor  market, with a lot of 
opportunity for new graduates.   The unemployment rate has risen  a bit, but it is still very 
low by historical standards , and by many  measure s it is a great time to start your career.

companies  and institutions  to work for.  Some of you will become entrepreneurs.  You 
have  already made one really good  decision, and that is coming to Spelman.  Whatever 
opportunities and challenges emerge, education will continue to be a key to success .

Thank you very much for the opportunity to address you today.  I’m especially 
pleased as an economist and policymaker to discuss the importance of education to the 
success of our economy.  At the Federal Reserve we spend a lot of time looking at economic data, such as production and employment .  In doing so, we try never to forget 
that these seemingly sterile numbers are, in fact, reflections of the economic aspirations, 
opportunities, and well-being of millions of Americans.  When individuals are denied 
opportunities to reach their maximum potential,  it harms not only t hose individuals, of 
course, but also the larger economy, whic h depends vitally on having a skilled, 
productive workforce.  As a re sult, we all have a stake in the essential work that you are 
doing for our children.  So how can we improve the opportunities for all children and give them a chance 
to succeed in our ever-changing, globalized economy?  As the husband of a teacher and 
an educator myself, as well as a parent and former school board member, I know from 
personal experience that, for creating opport unity and changing lives, there is no 
substitute for a quality educa tion.  The research shows that effective educations lead to 
lower rates of poverty, higher lifetime earnings, and greater satisfacti on on the job and at 
home.  And specialists in economic developmen t have identified educational attainment 
as a key source of economic growth and rising incomes in many countries around the 
world.  
Although education and the acquisition of skills is a lifelong process, starting 
early in life is crucial .  Neuroscientists observe that if th e first few years of a child’s life 
include support for healthy development in families and communities, the child is more 
likely to succeed in school and to contribute to society as an adult.  Conversely, without - 2 - 
 
support during these early years, a child is ul timately more likely to drop out of school, 
earn lower wages, depend on government  programs, or be incarcerated.1 
Consistent with this research, early ch ildhood education programs aim to nurture 
healthy development from the earliest years.  Programs that provide enriched experiences 
for children and that also i nvolve parents have shown to  benefit children from all 
backgrounds, but they have the strongest in fluence on children from disadvantaged 
environments.2  Importantly, state preschool a ssessments have shown that early 
childhood education programs make children be tter prepared for school, a precursor of 
future success.3   
The benefits of early childhood programs ar e not just short-term in nature.  
Careful studies demonstrate th at early interventions can have a positive effect on young 
children from low-income families that lasts well into adulthood.  For example, analysis of one program showed that children w ho attended a high-quality half-day preschool

 Economically speaking, early childh ood programs are a good investment, with  
inflation-adjusted annual rates of return  on the funds dedicated to these programs 
estimated to reach 10 percent or higher.6  Very few alternative investments can promise 
that kind of return.  Notably, a portion of th ese economic returns accrues to the children 
themselves and their families, but studies show that the rest of society enjoys the majority 
of the benefits, reflecting the many contribu tions that skilled and productive workers 
make to the economy.7

children, including the youngest.  Federal Re serve Banks have published articles and

make a special effort to reach schools with high proportions of minorities and lower-
income children.

Fighting Inflation with Rate Hikes and Balance Sheet Reduction

Thank you Peter,  and thank you to the  UCSB Economic Forecast Project for the 
invitation to speak today.  My plan is to start with my outlook for the U.S. economy in 
2022, and then describe what I consider the appropriate path of monetary policy to keep 
the economy on a healthy and sustainable course.1  But, before I get into that discussion, 
let me comment on what I think is on everyone’s minds today, Russia’s attack on Ukraine.  Obviously, there are  people in harm’s way and we shouldn’t lose sight of them .  
It is far too early to judge how th is conflict will affect the world, or the world economy, 
and what the implications will be for the U.S. economy.  But this situation adds uncertainty to my outlook and will be something I will be monitoring very closely.  As my speech will say, we will need to carefully look at the incoming data, especially during a time of heightened uncertainty.  
Turning to my outlook for the economy, m y greatest  concern is continued 
elevated inflation.  Inflation is too high, and I think concerted action is needed to rein it 
in.  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has multiple  tools to tighten monetary 
policy, and I will go into some detail about how I believe the Fed should approach 
increasing the target range for the federal funds rate and reduc ing the size of the balance 
sheet.    
But let me start with the outlook  for economic activity .  I expect the economy to 
continue expanding at a healthy rate  this year , slower than in 2021 but still at a soli d pace 
that will keep employment growing strongly.  While there are some signs that the effects 
of the Omicron variant have dampened economic growth in the last month or two, it does not appear to have affected hiring, given the healthy jobs  report  for Jan uary.  Even 
 
1 These views are my own and do not represent any position of the Board of Governors or other Federal 
Reserve policymakers.   - 2 - 
 
COVID- sensitive sectors such as leisure and hospitality saw big job gains last month.  
With COVID cases dropping sharply, I expect this latest surge  in infections  will not be a 
major factor affecting the economy in 2022.  Supply bottlenecks and labor shortages, 
some of them related to the pandemic, continue to weigh on economic output, but I expect those to diminish later this  year .  
The combination of strong consumer demand and supply constraints  has produced 
very high inflation.  The c onsumer p rice index (CPI) was up 7.5 percent for the 12 
months through January, the highest yearly rate in 40 years.  With appropriate monetary 
policy, and the expected easing in supply constraints , I am hopeful inflation  will move 
down over the course of this year , even with the recent  geopolitical developments .  
Nevertheless, the path of inflation is the biggest risk to my outlook.  
As we move through this year , I can’t emphasize enough how much this outlook, 
and the appropriate stance of monetary policy, will be influenced by the data that we see 
about the performance of the economy.  I know, I know .  Saying you need to be data 
dependent is like saying you are for motherhood and apple pie —who would disagree?  
But in the current situation, it is urgently im portant to be data dependent.  For example, 
like most people, I  expected the Omicron surge would hammer job creation in January, 
but the data showed that this didn’t happen.  The ups and downs in forecasts during the pandemic should be evidence enough that  policy decisions  this year,  more than ever, will 
need to be guided by the data, and not by what past experience suggests should happen.

2 In December, I discussed lessons from the pandemic for economic forecasters, which included a review of 
forecasting misses for output and inflation.  See Christopher J. Waller (2021), “A Hopeless and Imperative 
Endeavor:  Lessons from the Pandemic for Econ omic Forecasters,” speech delivered at the Forecasters 
Club of New York, New York, December 17, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20211217a.htm
.  - 3 - 
 
Missouri, which is home for me, is the Show Me State, so if you want to know how my 
outlook will evolve, show me the data.  With that in hand, I will evaluate th e outlook with 
respect to the Fed’s dual mandate in determining the appropriate setting for  monetary 
policy.  
The Labor Market  
Let’s start with where the economy stands with respect to maximum employment. 
In December, I said that we were “closing in” on this objective.3  Since then , the labor 
market has continued to strengthen.  I now believe we h ave achieved the FOMC ’s 
objective of maximum employment.  So, what has changed and made me more certain  
about that ? 
 A big factor was the jobs report for January, which included very strong data for 
that month, upward revisions for November and December, and revisions for all of 2021.  
What we learned from those changes was that a reported slowdown in job creation in the 
second half of the year never happened, and that in fact job creation was remarkably steady throughout the year, averaging 555,000 a month and never deviating very far from that trend.  These revisions helped explain why we saw such large and steady declines 
over the year in the unemployment rate, which fell from 6.4 percent in January 2021 to 4 
percent in January  2022, which happens to be  the median of FOMC participants ’ 
December estimates of the long er-run unemployment rate.  Accounting for retirees 
leaving the workforce, I estimate that employment is close to  the levels of  February 2020, 
right before the pandemic shock hit the economy and when the target range for the 
federal funds rate was much higher than the current target range . 
 
3 See Waller, “A Hopeless and Imperative Endeavor,” in note 2.   - 4 - 
 
 The January job numbers were just one monthly report, but one reason I have the 
confidence to declare that maximum employment has been reached is the message 
January sent about the durability of the continuing recovery.  Based on recent data, 
including a big increase in retail sales in January, it sure looks like a very significant surge in COVID has failed to derail or even appreciably slow the economy.  I t has been 
hazardous to predict much about the economic effects of the pandemic more than a month or two out , but I ’m comfortable saying we are at maximum employment in part 
because of the evidence that the labor market is continuing to strength en.   
Another message from the January report, including the revisions to each month 
of 2021, is that , so far at least, labor shortages do not seem to be having a huge effect on 
the economy’s capacity to create jobs.  Job creation didn’t slow appreciably i n November 
and December as originally reported ; it actually was higher than the average for the rest 
of the year.  Labor force participation isn’t growing as much as one would expect with 
the hot job market, but apparently it’s growing enough to keep the j ob creation machine 
humming.  
   Another factor that signals we are at maximum employment is the continued rise 
in measures of labor compensation.  The broadest measure of labor compensation , 
covering wages and benefits, is the e mployment cost index, which for private sector 
workers rose at a 4.7 percent annual rate  in October, November and December, the fastest 
pace in 20 years.  Average hourly earnings also continue to grow more strongly than they have in decades , and the gains are widespread across sectors.   Job vacancies also indicate 
labor demand is exceptionally strong with nearly 3 million more vacancies than individuals looking for work.  - 5 - 
 
Inflation  
 While I will continue  to watch data on the labor market, I am  focusing most of my 
attention on inf lation, which is far too high and needs to come down.  In December, some 
people were a little surprised to hear me say that inflation was “alarmingly high,” but 
after the latest  inflation numbers , I think we all should be alarmed.  It is alarming because 
high inf lation is especially painful for lower - and middle -income people , who don’t have 
a choice about paying more for gasoline , groceries, shelter,  and other necessities.  It is 
alarming because of the risk that high inflation could become ingrained in pe ople’s 
expectations and prove difficult to rein in, undermining economic growth.   
 The 7.5 percent increase in the CPI  in January came after a 7.1 percent increase in 
December.  It was the 11th consecutive month that inflation exceeded 2 percent.  The 
FOMC targets  another measure of inflation, the price deflator for personal consumption 
expenditures  (PCE) , which will be reported tomorrow .  But for both measures , inflation  
has been increasingly broad- based  for quite some time .  For the CPI, better than 70 
percent of items measured are up 3 percent or more in the last 12 months, and for PCE inflation, 60 percent of items were up that much in December.  
 High inflation is a significant problem for individuals and families, and it makes it 
difficult for busin esses to control costs and adjust prices.  There is also the risk that the 
public’s expectations of future inflation rise significantly, which affects spending decisions in the short term and thus can have the effect of driving inflation even higher.  
Keep ing longer -term inflation expectations anchored is vitally  important for monetary 
policy.  In fact, the FOMC’s S tatement on L onger -Run G oals and M onetary P olicy 
Strategy emphasizes that longer -term inflation expectations that are well anchored at 2  - 6 - 
 
percent  foster price stability and enhance the Committee's ability to promote maximum 
employment in the face of significant economic disturbances .   
Surveys of consumers’ expected inflation over the next year moved up quite 
notably through 2021 and are currently elevated.  And the public’s expectations of 
inflation over the next five years have risen  as well .  That said, five -year inflation 
expectations  are where they were over the past couple of decades  when inflation stayed 
low.  Importantly , longer -term expectations are much more stable.  For example, future 
inflation measured by investors trading inflation -adjusted securities has 5 -to10- year 
implied compensation around 2.2 percent, which , adjusted for the FOMC ’s preferred 
measure, PCE, is close to 2 percent .  In the sa me way that expectations of much higher 
inflation can drive a cycle of ever -increasing inflation, when expectations are “anchored” 
and don’t move significantly, it can have the effect of helping moderate surges in 
inflation , such as the one we have seen over the past year.  
 As for what inflation does next, I think anyone who makes a forecast has to own 
the fact that very few of us fore saw how much inflation would increase in 2021.  We 
underestimated the extent to which supply constraints —from bottlenecks to labor supply 
short ages—and strong demand would drive up inflation, and we  thought bottlenecks and 
shortages would begin to resolve sooner than now.  I think we have a clearer idea today 
of the effect of those factors on inflation  but going forward we need see how geopolitic al 
effects influence  energy, commodity, and other prices .  With some humility, while I am 
alarmed about the level of inflation  and a bit uncertain about how the near -term may play 
out, I am hopeful that these factors and the ir price effects are likely to e ase in the second  - 7 - 
 
half of  2022  and that with appropriate monetary policy, inflation will be coming down 
significantly  by year end. 
I will be  watching closely the data on supply pressures and how th ose feed into 
total consumer prices, and I’ll be monitoring  carefully to see whether expectations rise 
out of a range that would suggest they are becoming unanchored.  As I said earlier, it is 
too soon to know how Russia’s attack on Ukraine will affect the U.S. economy, and it may not be much easier by the time of our March meeting.  
Appropriate Monetary Policy  
Now let me spell out what my outlook implies for appropriate  monetary policy 
over the course of 2022.  Based on the inflation data  in hand, I believe the Fed needs to 
act promptly to begin tighten ing monetary policy.  As I said  earlier , I believe that we 
have achieved our employment goal and that the labor market w ill keep improving , 
which means there should be no delay in responding to inflation that is significantly 
above our target.   
The FOMC has already taken actions to end asset purchases in early March , and I 
believe that the recent inflation and jobs reports  have made the case to begin rais ing the 
target range for the federal funds rate at our March FOMC  meeting .    
Based on my outlook, my preference is to increase  the target range 100 basis 
points by the middle of this year.  That is , I expect inflation to remain elevated  and only 
show modest signs of deceleration over the next several months .  As a result, I  believe  
appropriate interest rate policy bring s the target range up to 1 to 1.25 percent early in the 
summer.  That would be a bit below w here rates were at the outbreak of the pandemic,  - 8 - 
 
when inflation was considerably lower, and before we more than doubled the Fed’s 
balance sheet, so I consider this a necessary and prudent start to  tightening policy.  
The pace of tightening will depend on the data.  One possibility is that the target 
range is raised  25 basis point s at each of our next four meeting s.  But  if, for example, 
tomorrow’s PCE inflation  report  for January, and jobs and CP I report s for February 
indicate that the economy is  still running exceedingly hot , a strong case can be made for a 
50-basis -point hike in March.  In this state of the world,  front-loading a 50 -point hike 
would help convey the Committee’s determination to address high inflation, about which there should be no question.  O f course, it is possible that the state of the world will be 
different in the wake of the  Ukraine attack , and that may mean that a more modest 
tightening is appropriate , but that remains to be seen.  With the economy at full 
employment and i nflation far above target, w e should signal that we are moving back to 
neutral at a fast pace based on the performance of the economy, and a 50 -basis point hike 
would help do that .  Consequently, should the data break against us in the coming weeks, 
we need to be prepared to hike the policy rate by 50- basis points.  
No matter the near -term path of reducing accommodation, the FOMC  must 
respond decisively to the data so as to maintain our credibility that we will bring down inflation.  We constantly say we have the tools to fight inflation, and now we must 
demonstrate the will to use them.  
While I believe that we should raise the target range by 1 percentage point over 
the next several months , I will be assessing the incoming data to decide whether further 
rate increases in 2022 are warranted  and, if so, at what pace they should be implemented .  
If high inflation persists, then I would most likely support that we continue  hiking, and  - 9 - 
 
potentially increase the pace of tightening.  If inflation moderate s in the second half of 
the year, as I expect, and as market participants expect , then we can slow the pace of 
tightening or even pause.  As I said earlier —show me the data.   
Turning to balance sheet policy, a s I noted, the Committee has decided to end 
asset purchases in  early  March.  Initially, we will be keeping the size of the Fed’s balance 
sheet co nstant  by reinvesting the proceeds of maturing securities .  The FOMC has not 
decided when  to begin the reduction in the size of the balance sheet , but we issued a set 
of principles last month that make it clear that chang ing the target range of the federal  
funds rate is our principal monetary policy tool, and that balance sheet reductions  through 
the “runoff” from maturing securities would commence after rate hikes have begun.   
I support start ing this process no later than the July FOMC meeting.  The pace of 
the reduction in asset holdings has  not been determined but will be consistent with 
promot ing the FOMC’s employment and inflation goals and will be communicated well 
in advance to the public so that the plan is predictable.   
The last time we r educed our balance sheet we did the following:   First, we waited 
two years after our first-rate hike before commencing balance sheet runoff.  Second, we 
imposed monthly caps on the amount of maturing securities that we would let run  off.  
These caps started out very low and were gradually lifted over a period of 12 months.  
So, w hy not follow the same strategy this time?  
First, back in 2017 and 2018 we had never intentionally reduced our balance sheet 
before.  T his was new territory for the Fed , so we went slow .  Second, the Committee 
was considering moving to an ample reserves regime for conducting monetary policy, 
where we wanted to keep the banking system flush with reserves.  Thus , we had no idea  - 10 - 
 
how far we could let reserves fall before we might cause an unwelcome shortage of 
reserves.  Third, the economy was in a much different place ; in particular inflation was 
much lower.  Finally, we only expected to run off about $2 trillion o f securities from our 
balance sheet.  In th at environment it made sense to go slow and gradual in terms of 
balance sheet reduction.  
Fast forward to today. This is now the second time we have done balance sheet 
reduction and we learned from experience and c an go faster than before.  Policymakers 
and markets have a good understand ing now of  how the process  works .   
In terms of the appropriate size of the caps, I believe they can be larger than last 
time for several reasons.  First, w e have a very large balance sheet —securities holdings 
have increas ed $4.5 trillion  since the start of the pandemic and the balance sheet is nearly 
$9 trillion .  So even with a hefty reduction in holdings over the next year , we will still 
have a balance sheet  that will be more than sufficiently large enough to conduct monetary 
policy.  Second, the Fed ’s overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility , put in place to 
help conduct monetary policy, receives a large amount of deposit s each day .  The daily 
average take-up of $1.6 trillion so far in 2022 tell s me that there is tremendous excess 
liquidity in financial markets.   Large redemption caps will assist in remov ing this excess 
liquidity.  Third, w e have learned a lot about operating in an ample reserves regime over 
the past decade .  And w e learned lessons from the 2019 experience in  reducing reserves.  
In the first quarter of 20 19 the ratio of reserves to nominal gross domestic product ( GDP ) 
was approximately 8 percent  and financial markets worked well and banks were flush 
with liquidity.  Right now, reserves are far more than ample,  standing at 17 percent  of 
GDP .  When evidence suggests that we are getting closer to a more appropriate and  - 11 - 
 
sustainable level of reserves, we can slow the pace of redemptions.  Finally, we have the 
newly established standing repurchase facility, which acts as a backstop to buffer any 
unexpected liquidity needs.  This facility can help assist us with any unexpected bumps  
along the way. 
With la rge caps and sizable amounts of securities maturing over the course of the 
next year or two, I do not see the  need to consider asset sales anytime soon.  However , 
because the Fed’s mortgage -backed securities (MBS) holdings have long maturit ies and 
are quit e sizable , prepayments are unlikely to bring these holdings down to de minim is 
levels over the next decade.  So, MBS  sales could be something the Committee consider s 
down the road to satisfy our balance sheet principle s long run goal of hold ing primar ily 
Treasury securities.  But that is a conversation for another day.  In the meantime, I would 
support having no caps on MBS redemptions so our MBS holdings decline as fast as 
prepayments allow, which would modestly assist in moving us toward an all -Treasury 
portfolio.  
Thinking about possible monetary policy actions in 2022, I expect it  will be a 
very fluid  year.  The Chair has said we will be nimble.  I believe nimble describes how 
we acted in 2021 as well, whe n nimbleness and good c ommunications ser ved the FOMC  
well.   Think back to the middle of 2021.  Just l ast June, markets expected tapering to 
begin sometime in 2022, the  majority of FOMC participants called for liftoff in 2023 , and 
primary dealers surveyed in July by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York predicted  a 
decline in the balance sheet wouldn’t start until the middle of 2025 .  Wow, how things 
have changed.    - 12 - 
 
Over the course of the second half of last year,  market expectations of the taper’s 
beginning quickly moved to November, and then a mo nth after it started, markets 
predicted it would be completed this  March.  Soon after, markets were pricing liftoff in 
March, with  several rate hikes over the course of 2022.  And  now markets are also 
focused on the start of the decline in the balance sheet sometime this year.  It is 
interesting to note that these dramatic changes in actual and anticipated monetary policy have occurred without volatility or strain in financial mark ets.  I believe the FOMC has 
been highly effective in communicating its shifting outlook for the economy and appropriate policy actions as the data reveal ed that inflation was increasing much more 
than forecasters expected . 
Another point to make about the big  changes in actual and anticipated monetary 
policy is that they are showing up in the financial data  today .  Financial conditions are 
tighter, I believe, because of the credible, forward guidance policymakers have 
communicated  to the public.  Alt hough t he Fed hasn’t started raising rates  or reducing the 
balance sheet , interest rates have moved up notably.  For example, the 2 -year Treasury 
yield is more than 1 percent age point  higher today than at the start of the third quarter of 
last year.  The 10 -year Treasury yield is up 1/2 percent age point, and the 30- year fixed 
mortgage rate is up about 1 percent age point  over this period.  Going forward, 
policymakers will adjust policy as needed , which will reinforce the Fed’s credibility.    
Let me conclude by sayi ng I hope m y remarks today  contribute to th e Fed’s 
effective and credible communications .  One message you should take  away is that the 
course of policy is not pre -set, and the course I favor will be determined by my 
interpretation of new data.  I n the past couple months , inflation and employment data  - 13 - 
 
have been sending the same, unequivocal message —it is time to start tightening 
monetary policy.  We need to take the first step in March to get off the effective lower 
bound.  Then we should continue with hikes as well as begin to reduc e our balance sheet.  
I will continue to monitor the geopolitical  situation  to assess the appropriate timing of 
this near -term monetary policy tightening.  Th ese act ions will get us into the second half 
of the year , when we will have six months of inflation data, and we can assess what the 
appropriate path will be for the rest of 2022.  Our goal is a soft landing for the economy 
that keeps output and employment growing at a healthy pace and inflation moving toward 
the FOMC’s 2 percent objective.  ",2022-02-24,waller

Recent Developments in the Labor Market  
 
 
 
Remarks by 
 
Ben S. Bernanke  
 
Chairman  
 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  
 
to the  
 
National Association of Business Economists  
 
Arlington, Virginia  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
March  26, 201 2My remarks today will focus on  recent  and prospective developments in the labor  
market.  We have seen some positive signs  on the jobs front  recently , including a pickup 
in monthly payroll gains and a notable decline in the unemployment rate.  That is good 
news.  At the same time, some key questions are unresolved.  For example, the better jobs 
numbers seem somewhat out of sync with the  overall  pace of economic expansion .  What 
explains this apparent discrepancy and what implications does it have for the future 
course of the labor market and the  economy ? 
Importantly, d espite the recent improvement , the job market remains far from 
normal; for example, the number of people working and total hours worked  are still 
significantly  below pre -crisis peaks, while the unemployment rate remains well above 
what most economists judge to be its long -run sustainable level.  Of particular concern  is 
the large  number of people  who have been unemploy ed for more than six months .  Long -
term unemployment is particularly costly to those directly affected , of course.  B ut in 
addition , because of its negative effects on workers’ skills and attachment to the labor 
force , long -term unemployment may ultimately  reduce the productive capacity of our 
economy.  The debate about how best to address long -term unemployment raises a nother 
important question:  Is the current high level of long -term unemployment primarily the 
result of cyclical factors, such as insufficient aggregate demand, or of structural changes, 
such as a worsening mismatch between workers’ skills and employers’ r equirements?  If 
cyclical factors predominate, then policies that support a broader economic recovery 
should  be effective in addressing long -term unemployment as well; if the causes are 
structural, then other policy tools will be needed.  I will argue toda y that, while both 
cyclical and structural f orces  have doubtless contributed to the increase in long -term - 2 - 
 
 unemployment, the continued weakness in aggregate demand  is likely the predomina nt 
factor .  Consequently, the Federal Reserve’s accommodative monetary  policies, by 
providing support for demand and for the recovery, should help , over time, to  reduce 
long-term unemployment as well.  
Recent Labor Market Developments  
As background for my discussion, let me provide a brief review of recent  job 
market indicat ors.  As this audience is well aware, job creation has picked up recently.  
Private payroll employment ( figure 1) increased by nearly 250,000 jobs per month, on 
average, in the three months ending in February,  and by about 190,000 jobs per month , 
on averag e, over the  past 12 months.   At the same time, layoffs in the public sector 
appear to be moderating.   Together with a lengthening of the average workweek, these 
employment gains have contributed to a significant  increase in aggregate hours worked  
(figure 2).   
The increase in  hours worked  is encouraging , because  the decline in hours during 
the recent recession was extraordinary.  From the  peak  of this series  in December 2007 to  
its trough  in February 2010, aggregate hours on the job by  production workers fell by a 
remarkable 9 -1/2 percent; by comparison, production -worker hours declined by “only”  5-
3/4  percent during the severe 1981 -82 recession .  Currently, hours worked are still about 
4 percent below the pre -recession peak --a clear improvement  from wher e we were two 
years ago , but still  far from where we would like to be . 
The government  estimates payroll employment --the number of jobs --from a 
survey of businesses --the establishment survey .  A monthly survey of about 60,000 
households, which provides the data needed to construct the national unemployment rate, - 3 - 
 
 offers an alternative  estimate of the number of jobs.   Employment as estimated from  the 
household survey, adjusted to correspond as closely as possible to the concept of 
employment measured in the establishment survey ( figure 3), also shows a n improvement 
in the labor market --indeed , by somewhat more  than in the establishment survey .  I 
should note, however, that  month -to-month changes in this measure are much more 
volatile than the  employment measur e from the establishment survey , which is why the 
Federal Reserve puts more weight on the establishment survey  for the purposes of short -
term forecasting .   
The positive signs from the labor market have shown through to measures of 
labor utilization :  After hover ing around 9 percent for much of last year , the 
unemployment rate ( figure 4) has moved down since September  to 8.3 percent in 
Februar y, and the share of employment represented by people working part  time for 
economic reasons, an indicator of underutilization, has declined modestly . 
Surveys of households and firms about their attitudes and expectations  offer yet 
another window on job market  developments .  Since the summer, household  expectations 
for la bor market conditions over the next year have  gotten brighter  (figure 5), unwinding 
a deterioration registered earlier last year.  Business hiring plans have also shown modest 
gains ( figure  6).  Other indicators, such as new claims for unemployment insuran ce and 
measures of the breadth of hiring across industries, also point to better  labor market 
conditions.  
Notwithstanding these welcome recent signs,  the job market remains quite weak  
relative to historical norms , as I’ve already noted .  After nearly two y ears of job gains , 
private payroll employment remains more than 5  million  jobs below its previous peak ; - 4 - 
 
 the jobs shortfall is even larger, of course, when increases in the size of the labor force 
are taken into account.   And the unemployment rate in Februa ry was still roughly 3 
percentage points above its average over the 20 years preceding the recession.   Moreover, 
a significant portion  of the improvement in the labor market has reflected a decline in 
layoffs rather than an increase in hiring.   
This last observation is illustrated by the data on gross job flows  (figure 7).  The 
monthly increase in payroll employment , which commands so much public attention , is a 
net change .  It equal s the number of hires during the month less the number of 
separations ( including layoffs,  quits , and other separations ).  In any given month, a large 
number of workers are being hired  or are leaving their current jobs, illustrating the 
dynami sm of the U.S. labor market.  For example, between 2001 and 2007, private 
employers hired nearly 5 million people , on average, each  month .  Total  separations , on 
average, were only slightly smaller .  Taking the difference between  gross hires and 
separations, the net monthly change in payrolls during th is period  was, on average,  less 
than 100,000  jobs per month --a small figure compared to the gross flows . 
The recent history of these flows  suggest s that further improvement in the labor 
market will likely need to come  from a shift to a more robust pace of hiring.  As figure 7 
shows , the declines in aggregate payrolls during the recession stemmed  from both a 
reduction in hiring and a large increase in layoffs .  In cont rast, the increase in 
employment s ince the end of 200 9 has been due to a significant decline in layoff s but 
only a mo derate improvement in  hiring .  To achieve a more  rapid recovery in the job 
market, hiring rates will need to return to more normal levels.  - 5 - 
 
 The Change in Unemployment and Economic Growth:  A Puzzle?  
What will lead to more hiring  and, consequently, further d eclines in 
unemployment ?  The short answer is more -rapid economic growth.   Indeed, the 
improvement in the labor market  over the past year --especially t he decline in the 
unemployment rate --has been faster than might have been expected, given that the 
econom y during that time appears to have grow n at a relatively modest pace .  About 
50 years ago, the economist and presidential adviser Arthur Okun identified a  rule of 
thumb  that has come to be know n as Okun’s law.  That rule of thumb  describes the 
observed relationship between changes  in the unemployment rate and the growth  rate of 
real gross domestic product  (GDP ).  Okun no ted that, because of  ongoing increases in the 
size of the labor force an d in the level of productivity, real GDP growth close to the rat e 
of growth of its potential  is normally required just  to hold  the unemployment rate steady.  
To reduce  the unemployment rate, therefore, the economy must grow at a pac e above its 
potential .  More specifically, a ccording to currently accepted versions of O kun’s law, to 
achieve a 1 percentage point decline in the unemployment rate  in the course of a year , 
real GDP must grow approximately 2 percent age points  faster than the rate of growth of 
potential GDP  over that period .  So, for illustration, if the potent ial rate  of GDP growth is 
2 percent, Okun’s law says that GDP must grow at about a 4 percent rate for one year to 
achieve a 1 percentage point reduction in the rate of unemployment.  
 In light of this historical regularity, t he combination of relatively modest  GDP 
growth with the more substantial improvement in the labor market over the past year is 
something  of a puzzle .  Resolving this  puzzle could give us important insight into  how 
the economy is likely to evolve.   To illustrate the tension, consider t he relationship - 6 - 
 
 between the recent changes in the unemployment rate and in real GDP relative to the  
predictions of  Okun’s law ( figure 8).  As illustrated by the position of the square labeled 
“2011” relative to the Okun’s law relationship, represented by t he line, the decline in the 
unemployment rate over the course of 2011 was greater  than would seem consistent with 
GDP growth over that period.  Indeed, with last year’s real GDP growth below 2 percent, 
less than  what most economists would  estimate to be the U.S. economy’s  potential rate of 
growth, one might have expected little change in the unemployment rate last year  or even 
a slight increase .  What is th is confluence of the significant decline in the unemployment 
rate and the mode st recent increase in re al GDP telling us about the state of the economy, 
and how will the Okun’s law puzzle be resolved?   
The apparent failure of Okun’s law could reflect, in part, statistical noise.  For 
example, it may be that future data revisions will show that real GDP grew  more quickly 
over the past year than currently estimated.  However, although i t is certainly possible 
that revised data will ul timately explain part of  the puzzle, at this point we have no 
specific  evidence suggesting that such a revision might be in the offing .  For example, 
gross domestic income, an alternative measure of economic activity constructed  using 
source data that are  mostly different from the data used in estimating GDP, provides 
some c heck on the information provided by the better -known GDP measure.  However, 
gross domestic income is currently estimated to have increased less quickly than GDP  in 
2011  and so does not point to an explanation of the drop in the unemployment rate .  
Another logical possibility is that the decline in the unemployment rate could be 
overstating the  improvement in the job market .  For example, potential workers could be 
giving up on looking for work to an unusual extent.  Because a person has to be either - 7 - 
 
 working  or looking for work to be counted as part of the labor force, an increase in the 
number of people too discouraged to continue their search for work  would reduce the 
unemployment rate , all else being equal --but not for a positive reason.   A story centered 
on potential workers dropping out of the labor force might seem in line with the low level 
of the labor force participation rate ( figure 9).  But other data cast doubt on th at idea.  For 
example, a broad measure of labor underutilization that includes peop le only marginally 
attached to the labor force  has decline d about in line  with the unemployment rate since 
late 2010  (figure 10).1  On balance, an assessment of  a broad range of indicators suggests 
that a substantial portion of the decline in the unemployment rate does reflect genuine 
improvement in labor market conditions.  
 Yet another  interpretation of the recent improvement is that it represents a catch -
up from outsized job losses during  and just after  the recession.   In 2008 and 2009, the 
decline in payrolls and  the associated  jump in unemployment were extraordinary .  In 
particular,  using the Okun’s law metric,  the run-up in the unemployment rate in 2009 
appears “too large”  relative even to the substantial decline in real GDP  that occurred .  
This point can be seen  by returning to figure 8, which shows the Okun’s law relationship.  
The open triangle labeled “2009” in the upper left of the figure shows an increase in the 
unemployment rate in that year well above the one implied by the contraction in real 
GDP and Okun’s law .  In other words,  employers reduced their workforces at an  
unusually rapid  rate near the business cycle trough --perhaps because they feared an even 
more severe contraction to come or, with credit availability shar ply curtailed , they were 
trying to conserve available cash.    
                                                 
1 The broader measure of labor underutilization re ferenced here is the U -5 measure of unemployment, 
constructed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  - 8 - 
 
  The diagram suggests that what we may be seeing now is  the flip side of th e fear -
driven layoffs that occurred during the worst part of the recession, as firms have become 
sufficiently confident  to move the ir workforces into closer alignment with the expected 
demand for their products.   Such a dynamic would explain the position of the square 
labeled “ 2011 ” in that figure  being  far below the line representing Okun’s law .  Of 
course, Okun’s law is a noisy relationship, and we don’t really know if the better -than-
expected labor  market performance of 2011 has largely  offset the worse -than-expected 
performance in 2009.  However, to the extent that the decline in the unemployment rate 
since last summer has brought unemployment back more into line with the level of 
aggregate demand , then further significant improvements in unemployment will likely 
require faster economic growth  than we experienced during the past year .  It will be 
especially important to evaluate incoming information to assess whether the recovery is 
picking up as improvements in the labor market feed  through to consumer and business 
confidence ; or, conversely, whether the headwinds that have impeded  the recovery to 
date continue to restrain the pace at which the labor market and economic activity 
normalize . 
The Challenge of Long -term Unemployment  
Discussions of the labor market at this juncture  necessarily have a “glass half -
empty  or half-full” tone.  Rece nt improvements are encouraging, but, as  I have noted,  in 
an absolute sense , the job market  is still  far from normal  by many measures , and millions 
of families continue to suffer the day -to-day hardships associated with not being able to 
find suitable employment .  Although most spells of unemployment are disruptive or 
costly, the persistently high rate of long-term unemployment  we have seen over the past - 9 - 
 
 three years or so  is especially concerning.  In this episode, b oth the median and average 
duration s of unemployment have reached levels far outside the range of experience  since 
World War II  (figure 11).  And the share of unemployment that represents  spells lasting 
more than six months has been  higher than  40 percent since  December 2009  (figure  12).  
By way of comparison, th e share  of unemployment that was long  term in nature  never 
exceeded  25 percent  or so  in the severe 1981 -82 recession .   
 Those who have experienced unemployment know the burdens that it creates, and 
a growing academic literature docume nts some dimensions of those burdens.  For 
example, research has shown that workers who lose previously  stable jobs experience 
sharp declines in earnings that may last for many years , even after they find new work .2  
Surveys indicate that more than one -half of the households experiencing long 
unemployment spells since the onset of the recent recession withdrew money from 
savings and retirement accounts to cover expenses, one-half borrowed money from 
family and friends,  and one -third struggled to meet housing expenses.3  Unemployment 
also take s a toll on people’s health  and may have long -term consequences for the families 
of the unemployed as well .  For example, s tudies suggest that unemployed people suffer 
from a higher  incidence of stress ‐related health problems such as depression, stroke , and 
heart disease , and they may have a lower life expectancy .4  The children of the

 unemployed achieve less in school and appear to  have reduce d long-term earnings

In addition, unemployment --especially long -term unemployment --imposes  
important  economic costs on  everyone, not just the unemployed themselves.  Elevated 
unemployment strains public finances  because of  both lost tax revenue and the payment 
of increased unempl oyment benefits and other income support to affected families.  
People unemployed for a long time have historically found jobs less easily than those 
experiencing shorter spells of unemployment, perhaps because their skills erode, they 
lose relationships w ithin the workforce, or they acquire  a stigma that deters firms from 
hiring them.  Loss of skills and lower rates of employment reduce  the economy’s overall 
productive capacity over the longer term.  In the shorter term, b ecause  the process of 
matching the long-term unemployed to jobs typically takes more time , the current ly high 
level of long -term unemployme nt might in itself be a reason that further progress in 
reducing the unemployment rate , and thus in achieving a more complete recovery,  could 
be slow .6   
A pessimistic view is that a large share of the unemployment we are seeing, 
particularly the longer -term unemployment, is structural in nature, reflecting factors such

 as inadequate skills  or mismatch es between the types of skills that workers have and the 
skills that employers demand.  If this view is correct, then high levels of long -term 
unemployment could persist for quite a while, even after the economy has more fully 
recovered.   And it appears true that o ver the past two decades or so, structural f actors 
have been responsible for some  increase in long -term unemployment .  For example, 
because an older worker who loses a job typically takes longer  to find a new job than 
does a younger worker in the same situation, the aging of the baby boom generation has 
probably contributed to a gradual rise in long -term unemployment.   Factors such as 
globalization, technological change, and the loss of lower -skill manufacturing jobs have 
likely reduced the employability and earnings potential of some groups of workers.  To 
the extent that higher rates of unemployment, especially long -term unemployment, result 
from structural factors, the scope for coun tercyclical  policies to reduce unemployment 
would be impaired , and the benefits of a more complete economic  recovery for many 
workers who are unemployed or discouraged would be more limited.  
However, a lthough structural shifts are  no doubt  important in the long er term, my 
reading of the research is that, at most , a modest  portion  of the recent sharp increase in 
long-term unemployment is due to  persistent structural factors.7  Consider, for example, 
rates of job finding by th ose unemployed for varying amounts of time  (figure 13).  
Unsurprisingly, the rate at which the long -term unemployed find work is lower than that 
of those who have been unemployed for only a short time; on average over the period 
from 1994 to 2007, a bit more than one -third of those already unemploye d for one to four 
weeks found employment within the next month.  In contrast, over that same period, only 
                                                 
7 For some  discussion of this effect, see Organisation for Economic Co -operation and Development (2011), 
OECD Employment Outlook 2011, www.oecd.org/employment/outlook;  and Aaronson and others , “Wh at 
Is behind the R ise in Long-Term Unemployment?” (see note 6).  - 12 - 
 
 about one -sixth of those already unemployed for more than 27 weeks managed to find a 
job within a month.   
If the recent increase in long -term unemployment were being driven by structural 
factors rather than, say, the severity of the recession, then the job-finding rates of the 
long-term unemployed should have fallen sharply relative to those out of work for only a 
few weeks .  But that’s not what we’re seeing.  Rather, as figure 13 shows, the job finding 
rates of the more recently unemployed and the long -term unemployed all fell over the 
recession in roughly the same proportion, and they remain low.8  This patte rn is 
consistent with cyclical factors accounting for t he bulk of the recent increase in long -term 
unemployment .  Similarly, the fact that labor demand appears weak in most industries 
and locations is suggestive of a general shortfall  of aggregate demand r ather a worsening 
mismatch of skills and jobs.  Counterexamples like the energy boom in the upper 
Midwest , where there may be some mismatch in the geographic location of suitably  
skilled workers or a n overall  shortage of potential workers with relevant ski lls, might best 
be interpreted as the  exception s that prove the rule; a mismatch story would suggest that 
strong labor demand would be appearing in more sectors or geographical areas by now.  
An empirical relationship that economists have long used to inter pret 
developments in the labor market is known as the Beveridge curve ( figure 14).  Th at 
curve --named after  the British economist William Beveridge --compares unemployment 
(the number of workers looking for employers) to job vacancies (the number of workers 
that employers are seeking).  In good times, when the unemployment rate is low, 
businesses are growing and workers are harder to find, so job vacancies tend to be high.  
                                                 
8 For an earlier analysis along these lines, see Michael W.  L. Elsby, Bart Hob ijn, and Aysegül Sahin 
(2010), “ The Labor Market in the Great Recession ,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity  (Spring), 
pp. 1-69. - 13 - 
 
 Similarly, in bad times, unemployment is high and  few jobs are available (vacancies are 
low).  Thus , the Beveridge curve, the relationship between unemployment and vacancies, 
is downward sloping.  
On the usual interpretation, a recession is a period in which the economy is 
moving down along the Beveridge curve; as output and the demand for labor fall, job 
vacancies decline and unemployment rises.  In contrast, changes in the structural 
determinants of unemployment  are thought to be reflected in  shifts of the Beveridge 
curve to the left or right.  For examp le, suppose that, becau se of changes in technology or 
in the mix of industries and jobs , the mismatch between the skills of the unemployed and 
the needs of employers worsens.  Then, for a given number of job openings, the number 
of the unemployed who are q ualified for those jobs is smaller  and the un employment rate 
is higher than it would have been before the mismatch problem worsened .  Graphically , 
an increase in a skills mismatch would be reflected  in a shift of the Beveridge curve up 
and to the right.  
From figure  14, we can see some  outward shift in the relationship between job 
vacancies and unemployment, consistent with some  increase in structural unemployment 
since the onset of the recession.   However,  a more in -depth analysis of the  evidence 
suggests t hat the apparent shift in the relationship between vacancies and unemployment 
is neither unusual for a recession nor likely to be persistent .  Research has found that 
during and immediately after the serious recessions  of 1973  to 1975 and 1981  to 1982 , 
the Beveridge curve also shifted out ward , but in both cases it shifted back inward during 
the recovery.   This temporary outward shift  during a deep recession  may be the result of a 
particularly sharp increase in layoffs, which raise s unemployment quickly, eve n as - 14 - 
 
 vacancies adjust more slowly.  Another possible explanation for a temporary shift in the 
Beveridge curve is extended and emergency unemployment insurance, which induce s 
unemployed workers who might otherwise consider leaving the labor force to continu e 
searching for work .  Or employers may be more selective in hiring when their need for 
workers is not pressing and tak e more time to fill vacancies  in an effort to find especially 
qualified hires .  In any case, the data appear consistent with the shift in  the vacancy -
unemployment relationship in recent years having been relatively modest and likely to 
reverse , at least in part,  as the economy recover s further.  When historical experience is 
taken into account, t hese patterns do not support the view that st ructural factors are a 
major cause of the increase in unemployment  during the most recent recession .9 
Conclusion  
 To sum up:  A wide range of indicators suggest s that the job market has been 
improving,  which is  a welcome development indeed.  Still, conditi ons remain far from 
normal, as shown, for example, by the high level of long -term unemployment and the fact 
that jobs and hours worked remain well below pre -crisis peaks, even without adjusting

 for growth in the labor force.  Moreover, we cannot yet be sur e that the recent  pace of  
improvement in the labor market  will be sustained .  Notably, an examination of recent 
deviations from Okun’s law suggests that the recent decline in the unemployment rate 
may reflect , at least in part , a reversal of the unusually large  layoffs that occurred during 
late 2008 and over 2009 .  To the extent that this reversal has been completed, further 
significant improvement s in the unemployment rate will likely require a more -rapid  
expansion of production and deman d from consumers a nd businesses, a process that can 
be supported by continued accommodative  policies . 
I also discussed long -term unemployment today, arguing that cyclical rather than 
structural factors are likely the primary source of its substantial increase during the 
recession.  If this assessment is correct, then accommodative policies to support the  
economic recovery will help address this problem as well.  We must watch  long-term 
unemployment especially carefully, however.  Even if the primary cause of high long -
term unemployment is insufficient aggregate demand, if progress in reducing 
unemployment is too slow , the long -term unemployed will see their skills and labor for ce 
attachment atrophy further, possibly converting a cyclical problem into a structural one.  
If this hypothesis is wrong and structural factors are in fact explaining much of 
the increase in long -term unemployment, then the scope for countercyclical policies  to 
address this problem will be more limited.  Even if that proves to be the case, however, 
we should not conclude that nothing can be done.  I f structural factors are the 
predominant explanation for the increase in long -term unemployment, it  will become 
even more important to take the steps needed to  ensure that workers are able to obtain the 
skills needed to meet the demands  of our rapidly changing economy.  ",2012-03-26,bernanke

 Nearly three years after we started holding Fed Listens events around the country, the 
program has proved to be even more valuable than we could have imagined.  Its original purpose 
was to elicit broad feedback as part of our monetary policy framework revi ew.  However, the 
Fed has long viewed community outreach as a vital part of our economic understanding, and these discussions have delivered such value that Fed Listens has evolved to join the other regular staples of our outreach work.    
These events enable us to hear directly from people on the ground, at the heart of the 
sectors and industries you represent, from communities across the country, to add tone, contour and greater depth to the nation’s economic portrait.  These insights are particularly valuable as we move through this challenging and precedent shattering period.   The speed and intensity of this downturn – and the rapidity of the recovery in many areas – are without modern precedent.  
I am very glad you could all join us today to offer your  thoughts, and I want to thank you 
on behalf of the entire Federal Reserve System for both your presence today and for your 
continued feedback and participation. 
Some of the issues you are confronting are shared across sectors, while others are unique 
to your fields. Most of you are contending with changed workplaces, from safety protocols whose half -lives are unclear to fundamental shifts in how your industries operate, in everything 
from feeding people to how movies are released. Business plans have been reworked, outlooks have been revised, and the future continues to be tinged with uncertainty.  
While uncertainty often results in immobility for businesses, it can also spell opportunity, 
and the creativity and adaptability on display over the past 18 mont hs have been among the few 
bright spots. I have been amazed and inspired by the flexibility and ingenuity, particularly that of small businesses, in shifting to meet the demands of a new reality.  3 
 All of us are very much looking forward to the discussion today. You provide a wealth of 
information by sharing your experiences and those of your colleagues, customers, and 
communities. That has always been crucial in how we conduct monetary policy but means even more in extraordinary times such as these.  
I want to thank you again for providing that insight and look forward to the conversation. ",2021-09-24,powell

For more than a century, the Economic Club of New York has served as one of 
the nation’ s leading nonpartisan forums for discussion of economic policy issues.  It is an 
honor to appear before you today to speak about the Fed eral Reserve’s pursuit of 
maximum employment and price stability.  
In December, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised the target 
range for the federal funds rate, the Federal Reserve’s main policy rate, by 1/4 percentage 
point.  This small step ma rked the end of an extraordinary seven- year period during 
which the federal funds rate was held near zero to support the recovery from the worst financial crisis and recession since the Great Depression.  The Committee’s action recognized the considerable progress that the U.S. economy had made in restoring the jobs and incomes of millions of Americans hurt by this downturn.  It also reflected an expectation that the economy would continue to strengthen and that inflation, while low, 
would move up to the FO MC’s 2 percent objective as the transitory influences of lower 
oil prices and a stronger dollar gradually dissipate and as the labor market improves further.  In light of this expectation, the Committee stated in December , and reiterated at 
the two subsequent meetings, that it “expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate.”
1 
In my remarks today, I will explain why the Committee anticipates that only 
gradual increases in the feder al funds rate are likely to be warranted in coming years, 
emphasizing that this guidance should be understood as a forecast  for the trajectory of 
policy rates that the Committee anticipates will prove to be appropriate to achieve its objectives, conditiona l on the outlook for real economic activity and inflation.  
                                                 
1 Board of Governors (2015), paragraph 4.   - 2 - 
Importantly, this forecast is not a plan set in stone that will be carried out regardless of 
economic developments.  Instead, monetary policy will, as always, respond to the economy’s twists and t urns so as to promote, as best as we can in an uncertain economic 
environment, the employment and inflation goals assigned to us by the Congress.   
The proviso that policy will evolve as needed  is especially pertinent today in light 
of global economic and financial developments since December, which at times have 
included significant changes in oil prices, interest rates, and stock values.  So far, these 
developments have not materially altered the Committee’s baseline --or most likely --
outlook for economic activity and inflation over the medium term.  Specifically, we continue to expect further labor market improvement and a return of inflation to our 2 percent objective over the next two or three years, consistent with data over recent months.  But this is not to say that global developments since the turn of the year have been inconsequential.  In part, the baseline outlook for real activity and inflation  is little 
changed because investors responded to those developments by marking down their expectations for the future path of the federal funds rate, thereby putting downward pressure on longer -term interest rates and cushioning the adverse effects on econ omic 
activity.  In addition, global developments have increased the risks associated with that outlook.  In light of these considerations, the Committee decided to leave the stance of 
policy unchanged in both January and March.   
I will next describe the Committee ’s baseline economic outlook and the risks that 
cloud that outlook, emphasizing the FOMC’s comm itment to adjust monetary policy as 
needed to achieve our employment and inflation objectives.  - 3 - 
Recent Developments and the B aseline O utlook  
Readings on the U.S. economy since the turn of the year have been somewhat 
mixed.  On the one hand, many indicators have been quite favorable.  The labor market 
has added an average of almost 230,000 jobs a month over the past three months.  In addition, the unemployment rate has edged down further, more people are joining the workforce as the prospects for finding jobs  have improved, and the employment -to-
population ratio has increased by almost 1/2 percentage point.  Consumer spending appears to be expanding at a moderate pace, driven by solid income gains, improved household balance sheets, and the ongoing effects of the increases in wealth and declines in oil prices over the past few years.  The housing market continues its gradual recovery, and fiscal policy at all levels of government is now modestly boosting economic activity after exerting a considerable drag in r ecent years.   
On the other hand, manufacturing and net exports have continued to be hard hit 
by slow global growth and the significant appreciation of the dollar since 2014.  These 
same global developments have also weighed on business investment by limit ing firms’ 
expected sales , thereby  reducing their demand for capital goods; partly as a result, recent 
indicators of capital spending and business sentiment have been lackluster.  In addition, business investment has been held down by the collapse in oil prices since late 2014, which is driving an ongoing steep decline in drilling activity.  Low oil prices have also resulted in large -scale layoffs in the energy sector and adverse spillovers to output and 
employment in industries that support energy producti on.   
On balance, overall employment has continued to grow at a solid pace so far this 
year, in part because domestic household spending has been sufficiently strong to offset  - 4 - 
the drag coming from abroad.  Looking forward however, we have to take into acco unt 
the potential fallout from recent global economic and financial developments, which have 
been marked by bouts of turbulence since the turn of the year.  For a time, equity prices were down sharply, oil traded  at less than $30 per barrel, and many curre ncies were 
depreciating against the dollar.  Alth ough prices in these markets have since largely 
returned to where they stood at the start of the year, in other respects economic and financial conditions remain less favorable than they did back at the time  of the December 
FOMC meeting.  In particular,  foreign economic growth now seems likely to be weaker 
this year than previously expected, and earnings expectations have declined.  By 
themselves, these developments would tend to restrain U.S. economic activi ty.  But those 
effects have been at least partially offset by downward revisions to market expectations for the federal funds rate that in turn have put downward pressure on longer -term interest 
rates, including mortgage rates, thereby helping to support s pending.  For these reasons, I 
anticipate that the overall fallout for the U.S. economy from global market developments since the start of the year will most likely be limited, although this assessment is subject to considerable uncertainty.  
All told, the Committee continues to expect moderate economic growth over the 
medium term accompanied by further labor market improvement.  Consistent with this assessment, the medians of the individual projections for economic growth, unemployment, and inflation made b y all of the FOMC participants for our March 
meeting are little changed from December.
2  A key factor underlying such modest 
                                                 
2 Specifically, the median projections of real GDP growth in 2016 and 2017 revised down 0.2 percentage 
point and 0.1 percentage point, respectively; the median projections of real GDP growth in 2018 and the 
longer run were unrevised.  The median projection for the unemployment rate in late 2016 was unrevised, 
while the projections for late 2017, late 2018, and the longer run were revised down slightly.  Finally,  - 5 - 
revisions is a judgment that monetary policy remains accommodative and will be 
adjusted at an appropriately gradual pace to achieve  and maintain our dual objectives of 
maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  Reflecting global economic and financial developments since December, however, the pace of rate increases is now expected to be somewhat slower.  For example, the median of F OMC participants’ projections for the 
federal funds rate is now only 0.9 percent for the end of 2016 and 1.9 percent for the end of 2017, both 1/2 percentage point below the December medians.  
As has been widely discussed, the level  of inflation -adjusted or  real interest rates 
needed to keep the economy near full employment appears to have fallen to a low level in recent years.  Although estimates vary both quantitatively and conceptually, the evidence on balance indicates that the economy’s “neutral” real r ate--that is, the level of the real 
federal funds rate that would be neither expansionary nor contractionary if the economy was operating near its potential--is likely now close to zero.
3  However, the current real 
federal funds rate is even lower, at roughly minus 1- 1/4 percentage point, when measured 
using the 12- month change in the core price index for personal consumption expenditures 
                                                 
although the median projection for overall inflation in 2016 was revised down 0.4 percentage poin t, median 
projections for subsequent years were unrevised; in addition, median projections for core inflation were 
almost unrevised for all years.  For additional information on the Summary of Economic Projections to be 
released with the March 2016 FOMC mi nutes, see 
www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20160316.htm . 
3 The neutral rate is not directly observable.  However, we intuitively know that it must have run well 
below its historical norm in recent years because otherwise the economy would have expanded at a much 
more rapid pace with the nominal federal funds rate near zero.  As discussed in my December 2, 2015, 
speech to the Economic Club of Washington (Y ellen, 2015), empirical evidence supports this intuition.  I 
showed that model -based estimates of the “natural rate,” when the natural rate is defined as the real short -
term interest rate that would prevail in the absence of frictions that slow the adjustm ent of wages and prices 
to changes in the economy, are currently close to zero in four macroeconomic models used by Federal Reserve staff.  Time series estimates of a different concept of the natural rate that is more similar to the 
neutral rate definition  used in this speech, such as Laubach and Williams (2016) and Lubik and Matthes 
(2015), are near historical lows.  See also Johannsen and Mertens (2016) for empirical evidence of a 
decline in the longer -run level of the natural rate, along with measures of  the uncertainty attached to 
estimates of its current value.   - 6 - 
(PCE), which excludes food and energy.  Thus, the c urrent stance of monetary policy 
appears to be consistent with actual economic growth modestly outpacing potential 
growth and further improvements in the labor market.4 
Looking beyond the near term, I anticipate that growth will also be supported by a 
lessening of some of the headwinds that continue to restrain the U.S. economy, which 
include weak foreign activity, dollar appreciation, a pace of household formation that has 
not kept up with population and income growth and so has depressed homebuilding, and 
productivity growth that has been running at a slow pace by historical standards since the 
end of the recession.  If these headwinds gradually fade as I expect, the neutral federal funds rate will also rise, in which case it will, all else equal, be appro priate to gradually 
increase the federal funds rate more or less in tandem to achieve our dual objectives.  Otherwise, monetary policy would eventually become overly accommodative as the economy strengthened.
5 
Implicitly, this expectation of fading headwin ds and a rising neutral rate is a key 
reason for the FOMC’s assessment that gradual increases in the federal funds rate over time will likely be appropriate.  That said, this assessment is only a forecast.  The future path of the federal funds rate is necessarily uncertain because economic activity and inflation will likely evolve in unexpected ways.  For example, no one can be certain about the pace at which economic headwinds will fade.  More generally, the economy 
                                                 
4 Assuming that the current gap between the actual federal funds rate and its neutral value is about 
125 basis points, simulations of the FRB/US model under vector -autoregression -based expectatio ns suggest 
that maintaining this interest rate gap for the next couple of years would lower the unemployment rate 
1/2 percentage point or so below what it otherwise would be if the gap were instead immediately closed.  
Under rational expectations, the pred icted effect would be smaller.  For further information, see Brayton, 
Laubach, and Reifschneider (2014) . 
5 Of course, any gap between the real federal funds rate and the neutral rate will eventually need to be 
closed in order to stabilize inflation at 2 pe rcent, keep employment at its maximum level, and the economy 
growing in line with its potential rate.   - 7 - 
will inevitably be buffeted by shocks th at cannot be foreseen.  What is certain, however, 
is that the Committee will respond to changes in the outlook as needed to achieve its dual 
mandate.   
Turning to inflation, here too the baseline outlook is little changed.  In December, 
the FOMC anticipate d that inflation would remain low in the near term due to the drag 
from lower prices for energy and imports .  But as those transitory effects faded, the 
Committee expected inflation to  move up to 2 percent over the medium term, provided 
the labor market improves further and inflation expectations are stable.  This assessment still seems to me to be broadly correct.  PCE prices were up only 1 percent in February relative to a year earlier , held down by  earlier declines in the price of oil.  In contrast, 
core PCE inflation , which strips out volatile food and energy components , was up 1.7 
percent in February on a 12 month basis, somewhat more than my expectation in December .  But it is too early to tell if this recent faster pace will prove durable.  Even 
when measured on a 12 -month basis , core inflation can vary substantially from quarter to 
quarter  and earlier dollar appreciation is still expected to weigh on consumer prices in the 
coming months .  For these reasons, I continue to expect that overall PCE inflat ion for 
2016 as a whole will come in well below 2  percent but will then move back to 2 percent 
over the course of 2017 and 2018, assuming no further swings in energy prices or the dollar.  This projection, however, depends critically on expectations for future inflation remaining reasonably well anchored.  It is still my judgment that inflation expectations are well anchored, but as I will shortly discuss, continued low readings for some indicators of expected inflation do concern me.    - 8 - 
Risks to  the O utlook  for R eal Economic A ctivity  
Although the baseline outlook has changed little on balance  since D ecember, 
global developments pose ongoing risks.  These risks appear to have contributed to the 
financial market volatility witnessed both last summer and in recent months.   
One concern pertains to the pace of global growth, which is importantly 
influenced by developments in China.  There is a consensus that China’s economy will slow in the coming years as it transitions away from investment toward consumption and from exports toward domestic sources of growth.  There is much uncertainty, however, about how smoothly this transition wi ll proceed and about the policy framework in place 
to manage any financial disruptions that might accompany it.  These uncertainties were heightened by market confusion earlier this year over China’s exchange rate policy.  
A second concern relates to the pr ospects for commodity prices, particularly oil.  
For the United States, low oil prices, on net, likely will boost spending and economic 
activity over the next few years because we are still a major oil importer.  But the apparent negative reaction of finan cial markets to recent declines in oil prices may in part 
reflect market concern that the price of oil was nearing a financial tipping point for some countries and energy firms.  In the case of countries reliant on oil exports, the result might be a sharp cutback in government spending; for energy -related firms, it could entail 
significant financial strains and increased layoffs.  In the event oil prices were to fall again, either development could have adverse spillover effects to the rest of the global economy. 
If such downside risks to the outlook were to materialize, they would likely slow 
U.S. economic activity , at least to some extent, both directly and through financial market  - 9 - 
channels as investors respond by demanding higher returns to hold risky ass ets, causing 
financial conditions to tighten.  But at the same time, we should not ignore the welcome 
possibility that economic conditions could turn out to be more favorable than we now expect.  The improvement in the labor market in 2014 and 2015 was considerably faster than expected by either FOMC participants or private forecasters, and that experience could be repeated if, for example, the economic headwinds we face were to abate more quickly than anticipated.  For these reasons, the FOMC must watch ca refully for signs 
that the economy may be evolving in unexpected ways , good or bad.  
Risks to the I nflation O utlook  
The inflation outlook has also become somewhat more uncertain since the turn of 
the year, in part for reasons related to risks to the outlook for economic growth.  To the extent that recent financial market turbulence signals an increased chance of a further slowing of growth abroad, oil prices could resume falling , and the dollar could start rising 
again.  And if foreign developments were to a dversely affect the U.S. economy by more 
than I expect, then the pace of labor market improvement would probably be slower, which would also tend to restrain growth in both wages and prices.  But even if such developments were to occur, they would, in my view, only delay the return of inflation to 2 percent, provided that inflation expectations remain anchored.  
Unfortunately, the stability of long er-run inflation expectations cannot be taken 
for granted.  During the 1970s, inflation expectations rose markedly because the Federal Reserve allowed actual inflation to ratchet up persistently in response to economic disruptions --a development that made it more difficult to stabilize both inflation and 
employment.  With considerable effort, however, the FOMC gradually succeeded in  - 10 - 
bringing inflation back down to a low and stable level over the course of the 1980s and 
early 1990s.  Since this time, measures of longer -run inflation expectations derived from 
both surveys and financial markets have been remarkably stab le, making it easier to keep 
actual inflation relatively close to 2 percent despite large movements in oil prices and pronounced swings in the unemployment rate.  
Lately, however, there have been signs that inflation expectations may have 
drifted down.  Ma rket-based measures of long er-run inflation compensation have fallen 
markedly over the past year and half, although they have recently moved up modestly from their all- time lows.  Similarly, the measure of long er-run inflation expectations 
reported in the University of Michigan Survey of  Consumers has drifted down somewhat 
over the past few years and now stands at the lower end of the narrow range in which it has fluctuated since the late 1990s.   
The shifts in these measures notwithstanding, the argument t hat inflation 
expectations have actually fallen is far from conclusive.  Analysis carried out at the Fed and elsewhere suggests that the decline in market -based measures of inflation 
compensation has largely been driven by movements in inflation risk premi ums and 
liquidity concerns rather than by shifts in inflation expectations.
6  In addition, the long er-
run measure of inflation expectations from the Michigan S urvey has historically 
exhibited some sensitivity to fluctuations in current gasoline prices, whi ch suggests that 
this measure may be an unreliable guide to movements in trend inflation under current 
circumstances.7  Moreover, measures of long er-run expected inflation gleaned from 
                                                 
6 For related background discussions, see Bauer and Rudebusch (2015), Abrahams and others (2012 [rev. 
2015), and D’Amico, Kim, and Wei (2014).  
7 Similarly , a monthly survey conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows a noticeable 
decline over the past two years in household expectations for inflation three years ahead.  However, these  - 11 - 
surveys of business and financial economists, such as those reported in the Survey of 
Professional Forecasters, the Blue Chip s urvey, and the Survey of Primary Dealers, have 
largely moved sideways in the past year or two.  Taken together, these results suggest that my baseline assumption of stable expectations is still justif ied.  Nevertheless, the 
decline in some indicators has heightened the risk that this judgment could be wrong.  If so, the return to 2 percent inflation could take longer than expected and might require a more accommodative stance of monetary policy than would otherwise be appropriate.
8   
Despite the declines in some indicators of expected inflation, we also need to 
consider the opposite risk that we are underestimating the speed at which inflation will return to our 2 percent objective.  Economic growth her e and abroad could turn out to be 
stronger than expected, and, as the past few weeks have demonstrated, oil prices can rise as well as fall.  More generally, economists’ understanding of inflation is far from perfect, and it would not be all that surprising if inflation was to rise more quickly than expected over the next several years.  For these reasons, we must continue to monitor incoming wage and price data carefully.  
Monetary Policy I mplications  
Let me now turn to the implications for monetary policy of this assessment of the 
baseline outlook and associated risks .   
                                                 
readings on shorter -term expectations may also be influenced by current gasoline prices.  Moreover, 
readings from this survey are only available since 2013, making it difficult to determine the significance of 
these results.  
8 Another risk to the inflation forecast, although one that has not changed appreciably sinc e the turn of the 
year, is that the Committee may have overestimated the longer -run rate of unemployment consistent with 
inflation stabilizing at 2 percent.  Currently, the median of FOMC participants’ estimates of this rate is 
4.8 percent.  However, this longer -run rate cannot be estimated precisely, and so it could be appreciably 
higher or lower --although given low readings on wages in recent years, I think the latter possibility is more 
likely than the former.  If so, a lower level of unemployment might be needed to fully eliminate slack in the labor market, drive faster wage growth, and return inflation to our 2 percent objective.   - 12 - 
The FOMC left the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged in January 
and March , in large part reflecting the changes in baseline conditions that I noted earlier.  
In particular, d evelopments abroad imply that meeting our objectives for employment and 
inflation will likely require a somewhat lower path for the federal funds rate than was 
anticipated in December.  
Given the risks to the outlook, I consider it appropriate for the Commi ttee to 
proceed cautiously in adjusting policy.  This caution is especially warranted  because, 
with the federal funds rate so low, the FOMC’s ability to use conventional monetary policy to respond to econom ic disturbances  is asymmetric.  If economic conditions were 
to strengthen considerably more than currently expected, the FOMC could readily raise 
its target range for the federal funds rate to stabilize the econom y.  By contrast, if the 
expansion was  to falter  or if inflation was  to remain stubbornly low , the FOMC would be 
able to provide only a modest degree of additional stimulus by cutting the federal funds 
rate back to near zero .
9 
One must be careful , however, not to overstate the asymmetries affecting 
monetary policy at the moment.  Eve n if the federal funds rate were to return to near zero, 
the FOMC would still have considerable scope to provide additional accommodation.  In 
particular , we could use the approaches that we and other central banks successfully 
employed in the wake of the financial crisis to put additional downward pressure on long-term interest rates and so support the economy --specifically, forward guidance about the 
                                                 
9 Research suggests that , all else being equal,  increased uncertainty and greater downside risk in the vicinity 
of the effect ive lower bound on nominal interest rates call for  greater gradualism under optimal policy  than 
would be the case if short -term nominal interest rates were appreciably above zero .  This phenomenon is 
known as “policy attenuation” in the economic literature .  For a discussion, see, for example, Adam and 
Billi (2007), Nakata (2012), Evans and others (2015), and Gust, Johannsen, and Lopez -Salido (2015).   - 13 - 
future path of the federal funds rate and increases in the size or duration of our holdings 
of long -term s ecurities.10  While these tools may entail some risks and costs that do not 
apply to the federal funds rate, we used them effectively to strengthen the recovery from the Great Recession, and we would do so again if needed.
11 
Of course , economic conditions ma y evolve quite differently than anticipated in 
the baseline outlook, both in the near term and over the longer run.  If so, as I emphasized earlier, the FOMC will adjust monetary policy as warranted.  As our March decision and the latest revisions to the S ummary of Economic Projections demonstrate, the Committee 
has not embarked on a preset course of tightening.  Rather, our  actions are data 
dependent, and t he FOMC will adjust policy as needed to achieve its dual objectives . 
Financial market participants ap pear to recognize the FOMC’s data- dependent 
approach because incoming data surprises typically induce changes in market expectations about the likely future path of policy, resulting in movements in bond yields  
that act to buffer the economy from shocks .  This mechanism serves as an important 
“automatic stabilizer ” for the economy.  As I have already noted, the decline in market 
expectations since December for the future path of the federal funds rate and 
accompanying downward pressure on long -term interest rates have helped to offset the 
contractionary effects of somewhat less favorable financial conditions and slower foreign growth.  In addition, the publi c’s expectation that the Fed will respond to economic 
                                                 
10 With regard to the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, the FOMC could increase its size by resuming large-
scale purchases of longer -term Treasury securities and agency mortgage -backed securities.  Alternatively, 
the FOMC could increase the duration of the Federal Reserve’s holdings without expanding the size of its 
portfolio by selling assets with relatively shor t residual maturities and buying equal amounts of assets with 
relatively long residual maturities.  Studies suggest that either action would reduce the term premiums 
embedded in longer -term interest rates considerably.  
11 For an overview of the macroeconomic effects of the Federal Reserve’s unconventional policies after the 
financial crisis, see Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider (2015) and the references therein.   For a discussion 
of the costs and benefits of these tools, see English, Lopez -Salido, and Tetlow (2015).   - 14 - 
disturbances in a predictable manner to reduce or offset the ir potential harmful effects  
means that the public is apt to react less adversely to such shocks --a response which 
serves to stabilize the exp ectations underpinning hiring and spending decisions.12   
Such a stabilizing effect is one consequence of effective communication by the 
FOMC about its outlook for the economy and how, based on that outlook, policy is 
expected to evolve to achieve our economic objectives.  I continue to strongly believe 
that monetary policy is most effective when the FOMC is forthcoming in addressing 
economic and financial developments such as those I have discussed in these remarks, 
and when we speak clearly about how such developments may affect the outlook and the 
expected path of policy .  I have done my best to do so today, in the time you have kindly 
granted me.  
  
                                                 
12 That said, market expectations are not always well aligned with the Committee’s baseline outlook for the 
federal funds rate. Market participants may hold different views about the economic outlook and the 
associated risks and at times may be confused abou t the FOMC’s strategy.  In such situations, the 
Committee must do what it believes is appropriate while clearly explaining the rationale for its actions.   - 15 -

Community Development in Challenging Times   
 
Remarks by 
Ben S. Bernanke 
Chairman 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
at the 
Federal Reserve Community Affairs Research Conference 
Arlington, Virginia 
     
 As always, I’m pleased to join you at the Federal Reserve’s biennial Community 
Affairs Research Conference.  This meeti ng brings together researchers, community 
development professionals, and public-sector officials to explore how best to strengthen 
struggling communities.  Needless to say, that endeavor is more crucial than ever.  The 
past few years have been very difficult.  Weak economic conditions at the national level 
have translated into hardships in many co mmunities at the same time that communities 
have fewer resources available for stabili zation and revitalization.  Considerable good 
work is going on nonetheless, and I will offer a few examples of that today.   At the national level, the economy is rec overing at a moderate pace.  In particular, 
the labor market has been gradually improvi ng and the unemployment rate has declined 
somewhat.  But unemployment remains quite  high, particularly among minorities, the 
young, and those with less education.  What’s  more, long-term unemployment remains at 
historically high levels.  Near ly half of the unemployed have been out of work for six 
months or more.  The housing market is also  holding back the recovery.  The foreclosure 
rate remains very high, and many homeown ers who have avoided foreclosure find 
themselves “under water,” meaning their mortgage  debt exceeds the value of their homes.  
Obviously, the problems in the labor market a nd the housing market are not unrelated.  In 
particular, lost income from unemployment is causing many families to fall behind on their mortgage payments. 
The Challenges to Communities 
 As families have struggled, so have their communities.  In some areas, for 
example, high foreclosure rates have produced significant numbers of vacant properties, depressing surrounding home pri ces, attracting crime, and creating financial burdens for  - 2 -
local governments.  Thus, some community de velopment groups now are simply trying to 
hold onto past progress that they have made in building up the physical  infrastructure and 
human capital of their commun ities, while others have lo st ground and are beginning the 
process of rebuilding.   While the scale of the problems has been exceptional, many of the problems 
themselves are not new for lower-income families and communities that were already struggling.  People who were vulnerable to begin with--those with low incomes, few 
assets, and less education--have had a more difficult time weathering the financial storm 
or recovering from setbacks.  The same is true for communities that were already relatively poor, with fewer community asse ts and insufficient drivers of economic 
growth.  To solve problems, we must first under stand them.  Like many of you here today, 
the Federal Reserve has been engaged for some  time in research and analysis of the 
economic challenges faced by neighborhoods and communities as well as by individuals 
and families.  For example, in 2008, the Federal Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors, in partnership with the Brookings  Institution, published a study of the effects 
of concentrated poverty on communities.
1  The communities studied included older inner 
cities in the North, smaller cities in the S outh and West, Native Am erican reservations, 
“gateway” neighborhoods that are entry point s for immigrants, and rural areas in 
Appalachia and the Mississippi Delta.  Wh at these diverse communities had in common 
was that they did not share in  our country’s general prosperi ty, even in good times.  Our

research identified some of the barrie rs to economic progress shared by these 
communities, including inadequate schools and workforce skills, lack of investment in 
infrastructure and business development, and limited institutional capacity.  Not surprisingly, these communities were particularly ill-equipped to deal with the recession.  
 Of course, economic conditions in a give n community both affect and are affected 
by the economic status of the individuals and families in that community.  One of the most valuable sources of data on family fina nces is the Federal Reserve Board’s triennial 
Survey of Consumer Finances.
2  To better understand the effects of the crisis on 
households, the Board, in a special update to its 2007 survey, asked th e participants about 
their financial and personal circ umstances two years later, in 2009.3  The findings help 
illustrate the challenges facing families and communities.  
According to this special survey, lower-income households continued to 
experience significantly more unemployment than higher-income households.  In 2009, 
nearly one-fourth of the families in the bottom half of the income distribution had at least 
one member who was out of work for some por tion of the year prior to the survey; this 
rate was about double that of  higher-income households.   
 Declines in the values of homes and st ocks sharply reduced the wealth of many 
Americans during the crisis.  Three-fifths or more of families across all income groups reported a decline in wea lth between 2007 and 2009, and the typical household lost 
nearly one-fifth of its wealt h, regardless of income group.  Mo reover, one in eight of the

3 For a summary, see Jessie Bricker, Brian Bucks,  Arthur Kennickell, Traci Mach, and Kevin Moore 
(2011), “Surveying the Aftermath of the Storm:  Changes in Family Finances from 2007 to 2009,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2011-17 (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 
Board,  March), www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2011/201117/index.html.  - 4 -
households in the panel started the crisis with  zero or negative net worth and thus had 
scant resources to fall back on to maintain  their standard of living during bouts of 
unemployment.  
Unemployment and declines in wealth  obviously can make it difficult for a 
household to pay its debts on time.  The survey update found that lower-income 
households fell behind on their payments at  a substantially higher rate than higher-
income households.  Among households with debt, about 11 percent of those with incomes in the bottom half of the income di stribution fell 60 days or more behind on at 
least one of their obligations in 2009, compared with nearly  3 percent of those in the 
highest tenth of the income distribution.    Just as lower-income households weather financial storms with more difficulty, 
the same is true of communities.  Even befo re the crisis, some neighborhoods, towns, and 
cities were in distress.  Thos e areas already lacked sufficien t assets such as strong public 
schools and community facilities, and risi ng unemployment and falling tax revenues 
reduced the funds available for public services  even as needs increased.  Often, residents 
were disproportionately unbanked or underba nked and relied on expensive alternative 
financial service providers.  In communiti es with already low housing values--due, for 
instance, to oversupply caused by population shifts--the wave of  foreclosures that began 
in 2007 sent the number of vacant propert ies soaring, causing additional problems. 
 In short, the financial crisis and recession touched many families and 
communities.  But those that were str uggling before the crisis were often 
disproportionately affected.  - 5 -
Responding to the Challenges 
 The challenges for those working to  address the many evident problems in 
troubled communities can be daunting.  When so many social and economic problems are 
interconnected--high unemployment, foreclosures , crime, loss of tax revenues and social 
services, lack of economic opportunity--decidin g where to start to improve the situation 
can be quite difficult.  Certainly no single program or approach will address all of the problems.  But realistically, we have to pick places to begin, with  the expectation that 
finding solutions in one area will confer wider benefits .  For example, providing 
responsible credit for indivi duals and small businesses th rough community development 
financial institutions can stimulate economic activity that generates local tax revenues.  Those tax revenues can be spent on programs to put vacant properties back into active 
use, helping to reduce crime, or on job training or economic development programs, 
leading to more employment and wage in come that can help homeowners avoid 
foreclosures. 
As the Board’s eyes and ears around the country, the Federal Reserve Banks have 
kept us well informed of the variety of ways local communities are meeting the challenges of tough times in troubled communities.  Though the following is only a small sampling of the work going on ar ound the country, I’d like to share a few of these stories 
with the hope that one community’s su ccess may lead others to emulate it. 
 In Massachusetts, for example, a comm unity development financial institution 
called Boston Community Capita l is pursuing an innovative st rategy to prevent occupied 
homes from becoming vacant and creating a strain on the community.  Through special 
financing entities, it buys fo reclosed-upon but still occupi ed homes from lenders at  - 6 -
market value.  The initiative, dubbed St abilizing Urban Neighborhoods, or SUN, is 
focused on six low-income neighborhoods in Boston that have the city’s highest 
concentration of foreclosures.  Taking a dvantage of the diminished home values, the 
group buys the properties and then resells th em at affordable prices to existing 
occupants--both owners and tenants--who can  demonstrate that they have suffered 
hardship.  This program prevents properti es from becoming vacant and provides families 
with a sustainable and affordable housing situ ation; it is designed to start small and 
expand as needed.    In the South, ACCION Texas-Louisi ana, a nonprofit organization, has been 
focused on assisting entrepreneurs start sm all businesses and helping existing small 
businesses to expand.  ACCION lends to entrep reneurs whose businesses are too small or 
too new to qualify for a regular bank loan.  Minority-owned businesses receive more than 
80 percent of its loans, and al most half of the lending goes to women-owned businesses.  
Since 2009, the organization has expanded from Texas into Louisiana to respond to small 
businesses affected by Hurricane Katrina.  The recession put extra pressure on ACCION, 
as existing borrowers were ha ving increasing trouble paying b ack their loans.  At the 
same time, demand for its serv ices increased, as newly laid-off workers were seeking 
loans to start their own businesses.  Th e organization responded by expanding its 
services--opening a business support center and business incubators, providing more 
comprehensive technical assistance, developi ng new business partnerships, reaching into 
new markets, and strengthening its underw riting platform to reduce waiting time for 
applicants and redu ce its own costs.  - 7 -
 In my home state of South Carolina, as in many parts of the c ountry, the effects of 
the crisis varies from community to commun ity.  For instance, the city of Charleston, a 
popular tourist destinatio n known for its historic architecture  and fine cuisine, is faring 
relatively well overall.  Even so, both une mployment and poverty in the greater 
Charleston area increased signi ficantly between 2007 and 2009.4  Median income in the 
nearby city of North Charlest on, which has struggled ever since a naval base closed in 
1996, is about three-fourths that of Charlest on.  In some older neighborhoods, families 
have moved out, leaving behind many vacant pr operties.  Some parts of the metropolitan 
area are experiencing economic growth, but the be nefits of that growth do not reach all 
communities.  While some major corporations  have expanded into the area, inadequate 
education and training, as well as the lack of  public transportation, make it difficult for 
many residents of low-income and minority co mmunities to take advantage of new jobs.  
Local development groups have been working to  ameliorate the situation.  For example, 
Metanoia CDC, a community de velopment corporation, is loca ted in the heart of the old 
naval communities of North Charleston, and it s work has visibly improved the hardest hit 
communities.  Its holistic range of programs--in community leadership, quality affordable housing, and economic development--appears to  be contributing to decreasing crime, 
rising student grades, and homes for first-time homebuyers.  The group focuses on 
building assets--both physical and human--s uch as transforming vacant buildings into 
                                                
 
4 For the Metropolitan Statistical Area, the poverty rate increased from 12.5 percent to 15.6 percent 
between 2007 and 2009 (for one-year estimates, see U.S. Census Bureau (2007), American Community 
Survey (Washington:  Census Bureau); and U.S. Census Bureau (2009), American Community Survey  
(Washington:  Census Bureau)) The unemployment rate in the area rose from roughly 4.5 percent to about 11 percent between December 2007 and June 2009 (B ureau of Labor Statistics and Haver Analytics).

homes for families and helping students in a Young Leaders program improve their 
performance in school.    In the San Joaquin Valley of Califor nia, the unemployment rate hovers around 
18 percent.  In 2009, in response to the ongoing foreclosure crisis, nonprofit agencies; 
local, state, and federal agencies; academic s; real estate professionals; financial 
institutions; small business and workforce de velopment professionals ; and loan servicers 
organized the San Joaquin Valley Foreclosure Ta sk Force.  The original intent was to 
coordinate efforts on a regional scale to a void preventable foreclosures.  This work 
continues, and the group is now expanding its efforts to also help families that have 
already gone through a foreclosure.  This year , the task force is be ginning a series of 
foreclosure recovery workshops across the valley.  Families w ill learn about local 
programs and assistance, including job trai ning and employment assistance.  Credit 
counselors will help them begi n repairing their damaged credit.  And, in cases in which 
they may be victims of fraud, they will r eceive guidance and referrals to legal aid 
attorneys.    As a final example, in Cleveland, local leaders in the Slavic  Village neighborhood 
have been dealing with some of the highest  foreclosure rates in  the nation since the 
1990s.  Cleveland saw population loss for five successive decades, resulting in an oversupply of housing.  With the onset of th e financial crisis, the problem began to 
worsen dramatically.  By 2007, Slavic Village was the Zip code with the highest number 
of foreclosures in the nation.  By 2010, more than 1,500 properties in a neighborhood of 
11,000 homes needed to be demolished.  Th is community has a history of strong 
neighborhood organizations, and as  might be expected, its resi dents, community leaders,  - 9 -
nonprofits, local governments, and companie s stepped up their efforts.  In one 
partnership, community groups are using data provided by a local univ ersity to identify 
borrowers at risk of foreclosure and are reach ing out to them, door to door, to see what 
might be done to prevent a foreclosure.  In another example, residents and community 
leaders in Slavic Village alerted county prosecutors to fraudulent lending in the 
neighborhood.  As the crisis continues to pl ay out, community leaders have found ways 
to reuse vacant land, adding gardens, yard  expansions, and bike trails among the 
neighborhood’s declining number of homes,  making it safer and more attractive.  
Business leaders are helping as well by purchasing and demolishing properties adjacent to the gardens and trails and supporting the renovation and expansi on of a nearby school 
and recreation center.  I have cited just a few examples of work  that is making a difference at the grass-
roots level all around the country.  They s how that, though the challenges in troubled 
communities are indeed daunting, we are far fr om helpless, and much good work is being 
accomplished.    For our part, we at the Federal Reserve will remain closely attuned to the economic health of all communities, includi ng low- and moderate-income communities.  
Each of our Federal Reserve Banks works w ith local leaders and community groups to 
provide relevant research, data, and support,  with the Board backing up these efforts 
across the country.  The broader economy is in a moderate r ecovery, and we have recently seen some 
welcome, if gradual, improvement in the labor market.  But our economy is far from 
where we would like it to be, and many peopl e and neighborhoods are in danger of being  - 10 -
left behind.  The work of community groups, lo cal leaders and businesse s, and others is a 
critical component to a national economic recove ry.  In addition to our work in regulating 
banks and in conducting monetary policy so as to achieve maximum employment with 
price stability, the Federal Reserve will con tinue to assist these efforts through local 
community outreach, by using its convening po wer, and through research like that being 
discussed at this conference.  If we work t ogether, I believe we can find effective ways to 
repair the damage done by the crisis to the economic prospects of families and communities.  Until vulnerable families and tr oubled communities have regained lost 
progress, the economic recovery will remain incomplete.  ",2011-04-29,bernanke

Current Conditions and the Outlook for the U.S. Economy  
   
Remarks by  
 
Janet L. Yellen

June 6, 2016  
  
I am delighted to be with you today .  I will discuss  recent economic 
developments, the outlook, and their implications for monetary policy.  My message will 
be largely favorable , although recent developments have been mixed.  Most importantly, 
the economy has registered considerable progress over the past several years toward the 
Federal Reserve’s goals of maximum employment and price stability, and, as I will explain, there are good reasons to expect that we will advance further toward those goals.  The news from the labor market over the past year has been generally good, with  
significant job gains, the  unemployment rate declining below  5 percent, rising household 
incomes , and tentative signs of faster wage growth.  At the same time, recent signs of a 
slowdown in job creation bear close watching.  Inflation has been lower than our 
objective of 2 percent, but I expect it to move up over time for reasons that I will describe.   If incoming data are consistent with labor market conditions strengthening  and 
inflation making progress toward our 2 percent objective, as I expect, further gradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely to be appropriate and most conducive to meeting and maintaining those objectives.  However, I will emphasize  that monetary 
policy is not on a preset course and significant shifts in the outlook for the economy  
would necessitate corresponding shifts in the appropriate path of policy.  
In particula r, an important theme of my remarks  today  will be the inevitable 
uncertainty surrounding the  outlook for the economy .  Unfortunately, all economic 
projections are certain to turn out to be inaccurate in some respects, and possibly significantly so.  Will the economic situation in Europe or China take a turn for the worse or exceed expectations?  Will U.S. productivity growth pick up and allow stronger growth of gross domestic product (GDP) and incomes or instead continue to stagnate?   - 2 - 
What will happen with the price of oil?  The uncertainties are sizable, and progress 
toward our goals and, by implication, the appropriate stance of monetary policy will 
depend on how these uncertainties evolve .  Indeed , the policy path that my colleagues 
and I judge most likel y to achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability 
has evolved and will continue to evolve in response to developments that alter our  
economic outlook and  the associated risks to th at outlook.    
The C urrent E conomic Situation  
The economic expansion following the Great Recession has now been under  way 
for seven years.  The recovery has not always been smooth, but overall, the gains have been impressive.  In particular, the job market has strengthened substantially, and I believe we are now close to eliminating the slack that has weighed on the labor market since the recession.   
I will turn to this past Friday’s labor market report in a moment, but let me begin 
with some background:  T he economy added 2.7 million jobs last year, an average of  
about 230,000 a month.  I n the first three months of this year, payrolls were growing only 
modestly slower, at a little less than a 200,000 monthly pace.  T he unemployment rate 
had fallen to  5 percent, down from a peak of 10 percent in 2009.  In addition, t he Bureau 
of Labor Statistics’ mea sure of the job openings rate was  at a record high  in March , and 
the quits rate --the share of employees voluntarily leaving their jobs --has moved up and i n 
March stood close to its pre -recession levels.
1  The increase in the quits rate is a sign that 
workers are feeling more confident about the job market and are likely receiving more job offers.    
                                                 
1 Note, however, that the help -wanted index published by the Conference Board suggests that the rate of 
job openings has been about flat over the past year.   - 3 - 
So the overall labor market situation has been quite positive.  In that context, this 
past Friday’s labor ma rket report  was disappointing.  P ayroll gains were reported to have 
been much smaller in April and May  than earlier in the year , averaging only about 80,000 
per month.2  And while t he unemployment rate was reported to have fallen further  in 
May, that decli ne occurred not because more people had jobs but because fewer people 
reported that they were actively seeking work .  A broader measure of labor market slack 
that includes workers marginally attached to the workforce and those working part -time 
who would prefer full -time work was  unchanged.  A n encouraging aspect of the report , 
however, was that average hourly earnings for all employees in the nonfarm private 
sector increased 2 -1/2 percent over the past 12 months --a bit faster than in recent years 
and a wel come indication that wage growth may finally be picking up.3   
Although this recent labor market report was, on balance, concerning, let me 
emphasize that one should never attach too much significance to any single monthly 
report .  Other timely indicators  from the labor market ha ve been more positive.  For 
example, the number of people filing new claims for unemployment insurance --which 
can be a good early indicator of changes in labor market conditions --remains quite low, 
and the public’s perceptions  of the health of the  labor market , as reported in various 
consumer surveys , remain positive.  That said, the monthly labor market report is an 
                                                 
2 Payroll employment is now reported to have increased 123,000 in April and 38,000 in May.  According to 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics, payrolls in May were held down about 35,000 by workers on strike at 
Verizon; thus, the strike can account for a relatively small portion of the slowdown in payroll growth in 
May.  The Verizon workers are now back on the job and should be included in the June payroll counts.   
3 Hourly compensation in the business sector (a measure that includes benefit costs as well as wage s) is 
now reported to have increased about 3 percent over the year ended in the first quarter of 2016, somewhat  
above the average increase in th is series over the preceding several years.  In addition, according to the 
Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s “wa ge growth tracker,” wage gains for continuously employed full -time 
workers have been gradually trending hi gher in recent years and were 3 -1/2 percent over the 12 months 
through April.  However, the employment cost index, another broad measure of labor compensation costs, 
has remained quite soft, rising only 1- 3/4 percent over the year ended in March.   - 4 - 
important economic indicator, and s o we will need to watch labor market developments 
carefully.   
Economic conditions  here in the Philadelphia metropolitan area have improved 
broadly in line with national trends.  During the downturn, the Philadelphia area and the 
city itself saw unemployment rise by less than it did  for the nation as a whole, but 
unemployment took longe r to recover thereafter.4  In the City of Philadelphia, in 
particular, unemployment was still running above 10 percent as recently as 2013.  But 
unemployment here has fallen appreciably since then, helped by a revival in residential 
and commercial construc tion that is evident around the city.   
While the general  picture of the labor market is largely positive, some people are 
still struggling.  Unemployment rates rose more during the recession for African  
Americans and Hispanics than for the nation overall, and even though those rates have also come down by more during the economic expansion, unemployment remains higher for these groups .  Unfortunately, those gaps have not narrowed noticeably relative to 
where they were before the recession.  Unemployment rates for young African  American 
and Hispanic men without a college degree remain especially high , and one important 
benefit from further improvement in the labor market would be increased job 
opportunities for these men and other groups that currently still experience high 
unemployment.  To be sure, many of the factors that contribute to the labor market 
outcomes of minority groups  are not amenable to monetary policy, and measures beyond 
the scope of monetary policy should be considered to alleviate the economic challenges

Statistical Area.  Since 1990, the area’s unemployment rate has averaged about 1/4  percentage point lower 
than the national rate.  By contrast, i n the C ity of Philadelphia itself, the unemployment rate has generally 
run about 2  percentage points higher than for the broader metropolitan area.   - 5 - 
that these and other Americans face.  Education and training, of course, are vital.  Later 
today, I will visit one program that helps workers in West Philadelphia learn new skills and then connects them with  potential employer s, an initiative in which government, 
businesses , and local institutions are working together  successfully .   
While the economy has made great st rides toward the FOMC’s objective of 
maximum employment, somewhat less progress has been made toward our inflation objective.  Inflation has run persistently below the Fed’s goal of 2 percent over the past several years even as the labor market strengthene d significantly.
5  Over the 12 months 
through April, the price index for personal consumption expenditures rose only about 1 percent.  But I remain optimistic, because two factors that have been holding down inflation will likely prove only temporary.  Fir st, the sharp drop in crude oil prices since 
the middle of 2014 has lowered prices of gasoline and other energy products, significantly restraining overall inflation.  At about the same time, the foreign exchange value of the dollar strengthened, holding down prices of imported goods.  But oil prices have stopped declining and indeed have risen from their low point earlier this year.  And, since the beginning of the year, the dollar has been roughly unchanged  against a broad 
basket of currencies.  As the do wnward pressure on prices from these two forces 
dissipates and as the labor market strengthens further, I expect inflation to move back to 2 percent.  
                                                 
5 The notion that inflation can be too low sounds strange to many people, but  very low inflation typically 
means very low nominal interest rates, leaving little room for monetary policy to push rates down to offset 
adverse shocks to the economy, thereby increasing the chances that  recessions and the associated job losses 
would be more severe and persistent.   In addition, persistent and unexpectedly low inflation may 
significantly raise the real cost of making mortgage and other loan payments if accompanied by (as is 
typically the case) smaller -than- anticipated nominal income gains.     - 6 - 
The E conomic O utlook   
Let me now turn to the outlook for the economy.  GDP growth was reported to 
have b een relatively weak early this year, but this measure of growth in economic activity  
can vary significantly from quarter to quarter.  Indeed, while spending data for the second 
quarter are limited at present, recent data on retail sales and motor vehicle s ales point to a 
significant step -up in consumer spending and GDP growth this quarter.6    
Stepping back from near -term indicators , I woul d like to focus more broadly on 
the factors likely to affect economic performance over the coming years.  Next week, 
concurrent with our policy meeting, the FOMC participants will release a new set of 
economic projections.  Those could, of course , differ from the previous set of such 
projections in March.  But speaking for myself, a lthough t he economy recently has been 
affected by a mix of countervailing forces, I see good reasons to expect that the positive 
forces supporting employment growth and higher inflation will continue to outweigh the negative ones.  As a result, I expect the economic expansion to continue, with the labor 
market improving further and GDP growing moderately.  And as I just noted, I expect to see inflation moving up to 2 percent  over the next couple of years .   
Let me start with the positive.  The increase in employment over the past several 
years  has contributed to higher household income s and strengthening consumer 
confidence .  If the May labor report was an aberration or reflects a temporary slowdown 
resulting from the  weakness in economic activity at the start of the year, then  job growth 
should pick up and support further gains in income .  In addition, r ising equity and house 
prices have helped restore households’ wealth.  The fall in oil prices has supported 
                                                 
6 On a seasonally adjusted basis, sales of light motor vehicles fell to an annual rate of 16.5 million units in 
March but then rebounded to a pace of 17.3 million units in April and 17.4 million units in May.   - 7 - 
household purchasing power  as well .  Simple calculations suggest that the average 
household has gained some $1,300 in purchasing power since mid- 2014 from the fall in 
gasoline prices.7  With continuing gains in disposable income and wealth, I expect 
consumer spending to grow at a solid rate.  I also expect t he housing sector  to make 
further progress.  Both home sales and construction have been gradually improving, and 
residential investment made  a noticeable contribution to GDP growth over the past year.  
Housing has been supported by low mortgage rates, and while mortgage credit is still difficult to obtain for households with low credit scores or hard- to-document income, 
those with good credit histories are generally able to borrow at very favorable terms.
8  
And fiscal policy at the combined national , state,  and local levels, which subtracted  from 
GDP growth for much of recovery, is now a small positive.   
 Economists often say, “on the other hand.”  So, in keeping with that tradition, I’ll 
now turn to the less -positive.  Economic developments abroad have significantly 
restrained growth in the United States over the past year, although I am cautiously optimistic that these headwinds are now fading.  Concerns about slowing growth in China and falling commodity prices, whic h afflicted global financial markets early this year and 
thus likely weighed on demand, appear to have eased somewhat.  Indicators suggest that foreign economies are growing, if still at only a moderate pace, and foreign financial markets have recovered an d stabilized.  That said, net exports have been a drag on U.S. 
GDP growth over the past year and are likely to continue to weigh on growth over the 
                                                 
7 In 2013, according to the Energy Information Agency, households purchased about 730 gallons per 
household on average.  Applying the drop in gasoline prices since the first half of 2014, savings per 
household averaged about $110 in the second hal f of 2014, $780 in 2015, and another $420 through May of 
this year, implying a  cumulative overall gain of more than $1, 300 per household on average.   
8 Housing could receive another boost if there were a continued revival in the rate of new household 
form ation, which has been depressed since the recession as young adults have delayed moving out of their 
parents’ homes.   - 8 - 
medium term.  This drag , in part , reflect s the prolonged effects of the significant increase 
in the foreign exchange value of the dollar since the middle of 2014, a development that  
has been particularly challenging for  U.S. manufacturers and other firms competing with 
foreign producers.   
Although lower oil prices have likely been a positive influence on the U.S. 
economy overall, they also have had a negative side, given the sizable U.S. energy 
industry.  New drilling and energy -sector employment have plunged , and the effects have 
spilled over to businesses serving the energy production sector.  But the largest declines in drilling activity are likely now behind us, and with oil prices having  recovered 
somewhat , I expect  that oil prices will become less of a factor.   
Business investment has been weak in the past six months or so, even beyond the 
energy sector, and investment in capital equipment is reported to have declined in the last quarter of 2015 and first quarter of this year.  I suspect there is a transitory element to this 
weak  investment performance , and I expect investment to rebound.  But the latest la bor 
market data raise the less favorable possibility that firms may instead have decided to expand their operations more slowly, and I intend to continue to pay close attention to 
developments in this area.  
As I said, the positive economic forces have out weighed the negative, and despite 
the challenges that the economy continues to face,  I continue to expect further progress 
toward our employment and inflation objectives .   
Some Important U ncertainties  
To be sure, there is considerable uncertainty about the economic outlook that I 
have been discussing, and, as I  have already noted, we should expect to be surprised in  - 9 - 
the future just as we have been surprised in the past.  Four  areas of uncertainty seem 
particularly salient at present.  
The first involves the thrust and resilience of domestic demand.  The U.S. 
economy has performed better than many others around the globe, and that performance 
has relied chiefly on the resilience of domestic sources of demand, consumer spending in particu lar.  So an important question is whether the U.S. economy could continue to 
make progress amid fairly considerable global bumpiness.  I continue to think that the answer to that question is yes, but the weak investment performance in recent months is conc erning, and Friday’s employment report provides another reminder that the question 
is still relevant.  
The second uncertainty  pertains to the economic situation abroad.  Even though 
the financial stresses that had emanated from abroad at the start of this y ear have eased, 
global risks r equire continued attention.  Much of the turmoil early this year appeared to 
be associated with concern over the outlook for Chinese growth, which in turn has broad implications for commodity prices and global economic growth.  Recently, the renminbi has moved in a more predictable fashion and Chinese capital outflows have abated.  However, it is widely acknowledged that China faces considerable challenges as it continues to rebalance its economy toward domestic demand and cons umption.   
More generally, in the current environment of sluggish growth, low inflation, and 
already very accommodative monetary policy in many advanced economies, investor perceptions of and appetite for risk can change abruptly.  One development that could shift investor sentiment is the upcoming referendum in the United Kingdom .  A U.K. 
vote to exit the European Union c ould have significant  economic repercussions .   - 10 - 
A third  key uncertainty for the U.S. economy is the outlook for productivity 
growth --that is, increases in the amount of output produced per hour worked.  While the 
job market has strengthened significantly, GDP increases have been less impressive.  
That combination of solid labor market gains and mode rate GDP growth reflects the fact 
that labor productivity growth has been unusually  weak in recent years, averaging less 
than 1/2 percent per year since 2010.9   
Over time, productivity growth is the key determinant of improvements in living 
standards, supporting higher pay for workers without increased costs for employers.  Recent weak  productivity growth likely helps account for the disappointing pace of wage 
gains during this economic expansion.  Therefore, understanding whether, and by how much, productivity growth will pick up is a cruci al part of the economic outlook.  But this 
is a very difficult question , and economists are divided.  Some are relatively optimistic , 
point ing to the ongoing pace of innovations that promise revolutionary technologies, 
from genetically tailored medical therapies  to self -driving cars.  Others believe that the 
low-hanging fruit of innovation largely has been picked and that there is simply less 
scope for further gains.
10   
My position has been, and remains, cautiously optimistic.  There is some evidence 
that the deep recession had a long -lasting effect in depressing investment, research and 
                                                 
9 The figures measure output per hour worked in the business sector.  From 2007:Q4 through 2016:Q1, 
productivity growth averaged about 1  percent per year.  By comparison , business -sector productivity 
growth averaged 1 -1/2 percent per year over the two decades from the mid -1970s to the mid- 1990s, and 
then it averaged 2¬3/4 percent per year over the next dozen years until the latest recession began.  
10 On the relatively optimistic side, see Mokyr (2014) or Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2014).  For a less 
optimistic  perspective, see Gordon (2016) or Cowen (2011).  Similarly, Fernald (2014) dates the most 
recent slowdown in measured productivity growth to before the great recession, in 2005.  For evidence that 
the recent slowdown cannot be fully explained by measurement difficulties, see Byrne, Fernald, and 
Reinsdorf (2016).   - 11 - 
development  spending , and the start -up of new firms, and that these factors have, in turn, 
lowered productivity growth.  With time, I expect this effect to  ease in a stro nger 
economy.11  I also see no obvious slowdown in the pace or the potential benefits of 
innovation in America, which likewise may bear fruit more readily in a stronger 
economy.  In the meantime, it would be helpful  to adopt public policies designed to boos t 
productivity.  Strengthening education and promoting innovation and investment, public and private, will support longer -term growth in productivity and greater gains in living 
standards.  
A fourth  important uncertainty for the economic outlook involves how quickly 
inflation will move back to 2  percent.  As long as oil prices do not resume their earlier 
declines and the dollar does not rise substantially  further, my expectation is that inflation 
will move up to 2 percent over the next one to two years.  But oil prices and the dollar can move unpredictably.  In addition, a further strengthening of labor market conditions would typically be estimated to exert modest upward pressure on inflation over the next 
couple of years ; but such estimates are inherently imprecise, and the effect on inflation 
could turn out to be significantly different , either upward or downward, than I expect.   
Uncertainty concerning the outlook for inflation also reflects , in part, uncertainty 
about the behavior of those inflation expectations that are relevant to price setting.  For two decades, inflation has been relatively stable, reacting less persistently than before to temporary factors like a recession or a swing in oil prices.  The most convincing explanation for this stabil ity, in my view, is that longer -term inflation expectations have 
remained quite stable.
12  So it bears noting that some survey measures of longer -term 
                                                 
11 See Reifschneider, Wascher, and Wilcox (2015).  
12 For a more detailed discussi on, see Yellen (2015a).   - 12 - 
inflation expectations have moved a little lower over the past couple of years, while 
proxies for these ex pectations inferred from financial  market instruments like inflation -
protected securities have moved down more noticeably.  It is unclear whether these indicators point to a true decline in those inflation expectations that are relevant for price setting ; for example, the financial  market measures may reflect changing attitudes toward 
inflation risk more than actual inflation expectations.  But the indicators have moved enough to get my close attention.  If inflation expectations really are  moving lower, that 
could call into question whether inflation will move back to 2 percent as quickly as I 
expect.  
Policy  Implications   
Let me now turn to the implications of the economic outlook, as well as  the 
uncertainties associated with that outlook, for monetary pol icy.  My overall assessment is  
that the current stance of monetary policy is generally appropriate, in that it is providing 
support to the economy by encoura ging further labor market improvement that will help 
return inflation to 2 percent.  At the same ti me, I continue to think that the federal funds 
rate will probably need to rise gradually over time  to ensure  price stability and maximum 
sustainable  employment in the longer run.           
Several considerations lead me to this conclusion.  First, the current stance of 
monetary policy is stimulative, although perhaps not as  stimulative as might appear at 
first glance.  One useful measure of the stance of policy is the deviation of the federal 
funds rate from a “neutral” value, de fined as the level of the federal funds rate that would 
be neither expansionary nor contractionary if the economy was operating near potential.  This neutral rate changes over time, and, at any given date, it depends on a constellation  - 13 - 
of underlying forces  affecting the economy.  At present, many estimates show the neutral 
rate to be quite low by historical standards --indeed, close to zero when measured in real, 
or inflation -adjusted , terms.13  The current actual value of the federal funds rate, also 
measured in real terms, is even lower, somewhere around minus 1 percent.  With the 
actual real federal funds rate modestly below the relatively low neutral real rate, the stance of monetary policy at present should be viewed as modestly accommodative .
14   
Although the economy is now fairly  close to the FOMC’s  goal  of maximum 
employment,  I view our  modestly accommodative stance of policy as appropriate for 
several reasons.  First, with inflation continuing to run below our objective, a mild 
unders hooting of the unemployment rate considered to be normal in the longer run could 
help move inflation back up to 2 percent more quickly .  Second, a stronger job market 
could also support  labor market improvement along other dimensions, including greater 
labor force partic ipation .  A third reason relates to the risks associated with the constraint 
on conventional monetary policy when the federal funds rate is near zero.  If inflation 
were to move persistently above 2  percent or the economy were to become notably 
overheated,  the Committee could readily increase the target range for the federal funds 
rate.  However, if inflation w ere to remain persistently low or the expansion w ere to 
                                                 
13 The neutral rate is not directly observable and must instead be inferred from economic data, and 
estimates will vary depending on the methodology employed.  However, we know that the neutral rate must 
have been well below its historical norm in recent years, because with the actual real interest having been 
as low as it has been lately, the economy would have otherwise expanded much more than has been the 
case.  I n recent years, the neutral rate has  likely been held down below norm al levels because of the factors 
I discussed earlier, including  persistently weak growth abroad, the high exchange value of the dollar, low 
rates of household formation , and weak productivity growth.  As I have noted before (see Yellen, 2015b), 
there is em pirical evidence to support the conclusion that the neutral rate is currently not far from zero.  
See, in particular, Lubik and Matthes (2015), Laubach and Williams (2016), and Johanssen and Mertens 
(2016).  
14 The targeted federal funds rate, currently 0.3 7 percent, less the 12 -month core inflation rate for personal 
consumption expenditures through April, equals about negative 1.2 percent.   - 14 - 
falter, the FOMC would be able to provide only a limited amount of additional stimulus 
throug h conventional means.15    
These motivations notwithstanding, I continue to believe that it  will be  
appropriate to gradually reduce the degree of monetary policy accommodation, provided 
that labor market conditions strengthen further and inflation continues  to make progress 
toward our 2 percent objective.  Because monetary policy affects the economy with a lag, steps to withdraw this monetary accommodation ought to be initiated before the FOMC’s goals are fully reached.   And if the headwinds that have lingered since the crisis slowly 
abate as I anticipate, this would mean that the neutral rate of interest itself will move up, 
providing further impetus to gradually increase the federal funds rate.    But I stress that the economic outlook, including the pace at which the neutral rate may shift over time, is uncertain , so monetary policy cannot proceed on any preset path.
16   
This point is well illustrated by events so far this year .  For a time in January and 
early February, financial markets here and abroad became turbulent and financial 
conditions tightened, reflecting and reinforcing concerns about downside risks to the global economy.  In addition, data received during the winter suggested that U.S. growth 
had weakened  even as  progress in the labor market remained solid.  Because the 
implications of these developments for the economic outlook were unclear, the FOMC 
                                                 
15 There are unconventional policy tools that could be employed to provide further support to aggregate 
demand, if necessary, and the efficacy and costs of using those tools would be weighed by the FOMC, as 
appropriate.  However, so long as these tools are considered i mperfect substitutes for the federal funds rate 
as an instrument of policy, the argument that the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates represents 
a source of asymmetric risk remains valid.  
16 Uncertainty about where the target range for the federal funds rate will be  in the long run provides 
another reason why increases in policy rates cannot be on a preset path .  I view the median value of 
3-1/4 percent from the March SEP as being a reasonable guess for the longer -run normal rate.  But FOMC 
participants have lowered their estimates of the longer -run normal rate over time, and as new evidence 
comes in and we see how economic conditions evolve, further changes, in either direction, are likely.    - 15 - 
decided at its January, March , and April meetings that it would be prudent to maintain the 
existing target range for the federal funds rate.   
Over the past few months, financial conditions have recovered significantly and 
many of the risks from abroad have diminished, although some risks remain.   In addition, 
consume r spending appears to have rebounded, providing some reassurance that overall 
growth has  indeed picked  up as expected.  Unfortunately, as I noted earlier, new 
questions about the economic outlook have been raised by the recent labor market data.  
Is the ma rkedly reduced pace of hiring in April and May a harbinger of a persistent 
slowdown in the broader economy?  Or will monthly payroll gains move up toward the solid pace they maintained earlier this year and in 2015 ?  Does the latest reading on the 
unemploy ment rate indicate that we are essentially back to full employment, or does 
relatively subdued wage growth signal that more slack remains?  My colleagues and I will be wrestling with these and  other  related  questions going forward.       
Conclusion  
 To summarize, I have explained why I expect the U.S. economy will continue to 
improve and why I expect that further gradual increases in the federal funds rate will probably be appropriate to best promote the FOMC’s goals of maximum employment and price s tability.  I have also laid out the considerable and unavoidable uncertainties that 
apply to both this outlook for the economy and to the appropriate path of the federal funds rate.  My colleagues and I will make our policy decisions based on what incoming  
information  implies  for the economic outlook and the risks to that outlook.  What is 
certain is that monetary policy is not on a preset course, and that the Committee will respond to new data and reassess risks so as to best achieve our goals.    - 16 -

Thank you, Doug, and thank you to the members of the Economic Club of 
Oklahoma for the opportunity to speak about a subject of vital interest to all of us —the 
outlook for the U.S. economy in 2021.  Our nation has made considerable progress since 
COVID- 19 hit the economy with great force a year ago, but we still have f urther  to go, 
and risks remain.1   
As we all know, starting in late February or March of last year,  widespread 
economic and social lockdowns and other effects of  the COVID- 19 pandemic caused t he 
swiftest and deepest contraction in employment and economic activity since the Great Depression.  Money markets, the Treasury market , and other parts of the financial system 
seized up, and there were fears of another severe financial crisis.  The Federal Reserve stepped in quickly to assist, reviving several lending facilities used in the previous crisis 
and creating several new facilities .  We also cut short -term interest rates to near zero and 
began purchasing large quantities of Treasury and agency se curities to help sustain the 
flow of credit to households and businesses.  Congress and the Administration also worked together to provide effective and timely support.  Calm was restored in financial 
markets , and employment and output began growing in May, but it was a very deep hole 
to fill.  Rapid progress over the summer gave way to slower growth over the past winter as COVID- 19 infection rates surged.  But in recent weeks, with steep declines in virus -
related hospitalizations and deaths,  the outlook ha s brightened.  Job creation had stalled 
over the winter months but picked up in February, with an increase of around 380,000 jobs.   The pace of vaccinations has  accelerated , COVID- related restrictions on economic

activity  are beginning to eas e, and the latest round of stimulus is boosting consumer 
spending.  
Despite the news of the spread of more- contagious COVID -19 variants, efforts to 
increase vaccine shipments and recently announced plans for distribution to the broader 
public are encouraging and , if successful, give me some confidence that our economic 
performance will continue to improve  quickly over the remainder of the year.   
My outlook for the economy is broadly in line with the median of projections of 
other  members of the Federal Open Market  Committee  (FOMC) , published following our 
meeting last week.  Most of my FOMC colleagues expect the economy to  grow between 
5.8 percent  and 6.6 percent  in 2021,  and the median projection is that the unemployment 
rate will fall to 4. 5 percent by the end of  the year.  My own expectation is for strong 
growth and a rebound in the labor force participation rate once the economy fully reopens .  This would include s chools resum ing fulltime in -person learning,  which would 
enable parents who reduced their hours or left the workforce to oversee virtual education 
and childcare to  return to fulltime work.     
As of February, the level of payroll employment is still 9- 1/2 million below the 
pre-pandemic peak and more than 11 million below where it would have been based on 
the trend before the pandemic.  I believe that job creation will continue, but I still see considerable uncertainty about the strength of that improvement and how long it may take to reach the Federal Reserve’s maximum -employment goal.  I am also concerned 
that the extended period of economic restrictions will contribute to further business closures.  S evere restrictions on mobility and commerce were implemented in many areas 
to control the spread of the virus, but they came at a very high economic cost.  There is  - 3 - 
some evidence, which I will discuss in a moment, that small businesses fared better in 
states with less -stringent restrictions.  While the headline unemployment rate has 
continued to fall, the number of people who report being unemployed for more  than six 
months has continued to rise, suggesting a risk of scarring—meaning  that some 
individuals could see an erosion of their skills and their connections to the labor market.  
Although economic activity in the travel, leisure , and hospitality sectors has 
continued to lag the recovery, there have been some bright spots elsewhere.  Two that are particularly important for Oklahoma are agriculture and energy.  Commodity prices for some crops have increased dramatically in the past few months, particularly s oybeans and 
corn, reflect ing higher export demand and some limits on global supply.  Increased prices 
are providing better cash flow and improved credit terms  for farmers .  Agricultural 
manufacturers and other suppliers are reporting order backlogs through the summer 
months, and there are some reports of firmer or increased prices for farmland.   
Meanwhile, the recent surge in oil prices has returned West Texas Intermediate 
back up near the levels of early 2020, when it began to fall sharply.  The rebound  in 
prices reflects the improved outlook for the global econom y given significant progress 
toward widespread vaccinations in many countries.  This recovery has  not had a dramatic 
effect yet on businesses engaged in or supporting oil and gas extraction, but there are signs of a turnaround.  So far this year, retail gasoline prices have been rising sharply, and the North American rig count is now the highest it has be en since last April.  
But in contrast to the broadening improvements in many sectors of the economy, 
an area I continue to be concerned about is the outlook for U.S. businesses, particularly small businesses, which have borne the brunt of the effects of the pandemic.  We are now  - 4 - 
more than a year into the pandemic, and many small businesses are continuing to struggle 
in their efforts to remain open.  Recently, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released counts of business closures for the second quarter of  last year, when most face- to-face 
businesses were largely shuttered.
2  In that quarter, the closure rate for establishments 
showed a sharp increase to 9 percent, compared with an average of about 5 percent during 2019.   
As part of the fiscal stimulus pa ckage passed in June last year, the Paycheck 
Protection Program (PPP) and other government supports helped many businesses withstand the extended period of inactivity over the spring and summer.  Many of the 
shuttered businesses were at least partially reo pened in the second half of last year.  But 
as virus cases surged toward the end of 2020, many state and local governments reimposed restrictions on business activity, and others postponed plans to lift their 
existing restrictions.   
Even today, more than a year later, some sectors, like restaurants, leisure, and 
tourism, are continuing to face major effects  from pandemic -related social distancing, 
forced closures, and capacity limits.  These restrictions may have been helpful in containing the pandemic, but they appear to have disproportionately impeded  small 
firms’  ability to maintain their operations and revenue sources, leading to substantial cash 
flow pressures.  Small businesses will be helped in the near term with a new round of 
PPP lending, which inc luded adjustments to terms that will make forgiveness of these 
loans less onerous  than before.  Even with this, financial pressures on many small 
 
2 The BLS counts an establishment as “closed” if it reports no employment (or does not report at  all) in the 
third month of the quarter after reporting positive employment in the third month of the previous quarter.  
The BLS will eventually categorize closed businesses as “deaths” if they stay closed for four quarters.  In 
recent years, the annual es tablishment death rate has been around 8.5 percent.   - 5 - 
businesses remain acute, and I am concerned that a growing number of small businesses 
have already been closed  permanently or are on the verge of failure.  
The BLS data are not yet available beyond the second quarter of last year, so , 
from that source , it’s difficult to assess the full extent to which the COVID -19 pandemic 
resulted in permanent business closures.  But research by the Board ’s staff using 
nontraditional data sources finds that , in 2020 , business exits were especially elevated 
among small firms and particularly in industries most sensitive to social distancing.3  The 
authors found that the permanent e xit rate of restaurants in 2020 was about 50 percent 
higher than average historical rates.  
On a related note, I would emphasize that, up to this point, the national data on 
business loan delinquencies and bankruptcy filings have not been especially concerning.  That said, small businesses are often unincorporated, and many go under without 
declaring bankruptcy or defaulting on loans.  In fact, many small business owners rely on 
credit cards or home equity loans for financing, so their failure to make timely  payments 
would not be reflected in data on business  loan delinquencies.  
Elsewhere, evidence of small business finance fragility is shown in Federal 
Reserve survey data.  In the latest reading from the Small Business Credit Survey 
conducted in October 2020 , 80 percent of firms reported seeing a decline in revenue over 
last year, and two -thirds of those reported declines of at least 25  percent.  Since then, 
there have been indications that things have gotten worse.  For example, in February , 
survey data from  the National Federation of Independent Business indicate that a net

“Business Exit during the COVID -19 Pandemic:  Non- Traditional Measures in Historical Context,” 
Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2020-089 (Washington:  Board of Governors, October), 
https://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2020.089 .   - 6 - 
majority of small businesses reported declines in earnings over the past three months, and 
a net majority expect their sales to worsen over the next three months.  
These economic data align with conversations that I have had with bankers across 
the country, which consistently point to the emerging credit challenges among small and 
medium -sized businesses as a major source of concern.  Bankers note that the substantial 
support from the Paycheck Protection Program and other fiscal polic ies have postponed, 
but not eliminated, these financ ial pressures.  The bankers I speak with have also noted 
that, while monetary policy has successfully delivered favorable borrowing conditions, 
many firms are reluctant to take on debt or additional borrowing because of the highly uncertain business climat e.  Recent data from the from the Fed’s Senior Loan Officer 
Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices tell a similar story:  The January edition of that survey showed a majority of banks reporting weaker demand for commercial and industrial loans to firms o f all sizes.  
The sharp, and largely voluntary, pullback in consumer spending that followed 
the onset of the pandemic was undoubtedly a major trigger for the financial struggles that businesses are now facing.  But in addition, there is evidence that the economic restri ctions imposed by many state and local governments have played a role in the 
deteriorating health of small businesses.  Using data from the Small  Business Pulse 
Survey conducted by the Census Bureau, the Board ’s staff found that , in states with 
tighter res trictions on business activity, small firms were more likely to report large 
declines in their business operations.  Firms in relatively restrictive states were also more likely to report that they expect to operate at reduced capacity for an extended peri od, and 
they were more likely to expect to need financial assistance in the next six months.   - 7 - 
While obviously not conclusive, the visible relationship between state -level economic 
restrictions and small business damage is both striking and concerning.  
You may be tempted to ask why I am so focused on small businesses.  For one, it 
is because t he roughly 32 million small businesses in the United States compris e an 
important source of job growth in the macroeconomy, and they have an outsized impact 
on their local communities.  Over the past decade, small businesses created 10.5 million net new jobs, accounting for roughly two- thirds of overall net new job creation.  This, as 
I see it, is why the potential for a wave of small business failures is one of the main  risks 
to my expectation that our economy will make further substantial progress toward our goal of full employment.  Moreover, from my vantage point as a former community 
banker, I see other potential negative consequences:  Because small businesses often  
form the backbone of the communities where they are located, their disappearance could have profound and long- lasting community -level effects  as well.  
As I l ook further down the road, there are some tentative signs that the pickup in 
overall economic acti vity will eventually bring an improvement in conditions for small 
businesses.  For example, the latest responses to the same Small Business Pulse S urvey I 
mentioned earlier now indicate that expect ations of  small business failures —which were 
quite high dur ing most of 2020—have dropped noticeably and are now tracking below 
the average rate of failures observed over the five years preceding the pandemic.   
I spoke earlier about employment , and I w ill now turn to the price -stability side of 
the Fed’s mandated goals for monetary policy.  In recent months , we have seen consumer 
price inflation moving up, and I anticipate that the 12- month rates in the next few months 
will very likely track above our 2 percent benchmark as the unusual softness in prices  - 8 - 
that we saw in April and May last year drops  out of the calculation.  The marked rise in 
food prices  over the past 12 months has also pushed up the headline measures of price 
inflation.  F or many other categories of consumer goods, high order backlogs and tight 
supplies of key production inputs —like lumber  and semiconductors —as well as  logjams 
at the nation’s ports and a shortage of truck drivers  are likely to push up prices  over the 
next several months.  But I expect that these pricing pressures will be temporar y, easing 
over the course of this year as supply bottlenecks are gradually resolved.       
Beyond this year, some observers have expressed concern that a rapid recovery in 
aggregate demand amid substantial fiscal support and accommodative monetary policy 
could lead to undesirably high inflation.  While I expect that the stronger economy will 
push up inflation somewhat, let me explain why I do not expect pricing pressures to be 
excessive and why I believe the Federal Reserve is likely to continue supporting the economy for some time through accommodative monetary policy.    
 Here I will point to what has in the past seemed to be  a relationship between 
inflation and unemployment, known as the Phillips c urve.  Over the past several decades, 
despite large swings  in unemployment, inflation has been extremely  stable .  As an 
example, u p to the beginning of the pandemic, when the economy was growing and 
unemployment was at a 50 year low of 3.5 percent , inflation was still very low and stable.  
Economists often attrib ute this so -called flat Phillips curve to the fact that individuals’ 
inflation expectations are well anchored and unlikely to respond to short -term pricing 
movements.  Survey data on long- run inflation expectations tend to back up this idea.  
They have bee n remarkably stable over the past decade, and , although they declined   - 9 - 
moderately   during the middle of last year, most measures have edged up again in recent 
months and now stand roughly at the levels observed during the pre -pandemic period.  
With all of th at said, given our  lack of historical experience with both this level of 
substantial fiscal stimulus and highly accommodative monetary policy,  my outlook for 
inflation is fairly uncertain .  When making monetary policy decisions, we would be 
concerned about a significant increase in inflation above our 2  percent goal that was 
sustained for some time.  But as my Fed colleagues and I have said many times, monetary 
policy is not on a preset course.  I will continue to monitor economic developments carefully, and , if my outlook for inflation were to change materially, my assessment of 
the appropriate stance of monetary policy would change as well.  
I will wrap up by noting that the economy has ma de great progress since last 
spring,  and I am optimistic that will continue in 2021 , but we still have significant ground 
to make up and new strains of COVID -19 could slow progress in containing the 
pandemic.  Last year’s sharp contraction in economic acti vity was like nothing we had 
seen before, and we are still assessing its impact.  One unresolved question, in my mind, is how resilient small businesses will prove to be after the extended period of reduced activity.   
What does all of this mean for the outlook for monetary policy?  As we indicated 
in the policy statement released last week, my FOMC colleagues and I expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until employment and inflation achieve levels consistent with our maximum employm ent and inflation goals.  At this point, the 
economy is still a long way from those goals.  We are making progress, but I think it will take some time for us to get there.  ",2021-03-22,bowman

It is a pleasure to be here today.  I will begin with the economy and the road 
ahead for monetary policy before briefly discussing the Fed eral Reserve ’s monetary 
policy independence.   
Over the past year, inflation has come down significantly but is still running 
above the Federal Open Market Committee’s  (FOMC) 2  percent goal .  In February, 
headline inflation was 2.5  percent  over the past 12 months based on the personal 
consumption expenditures (PCE) index.  A year earlier, it was 5.2 percent.  Core 
inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy components, stood at 2 .8 percent ; a 
year ago , it was 4.8  percent .  While this progress is welcome, the job of sustainably 
restoring 2  percent inflation is not yet done.    
Tight m onetary policy continues to weigh on demand, particularly in interest -
sensitive spending categories.  Nonetheless, growth in economic activity and employment 
was strong in 2023, as real gross domestic product expanded more than 3  percent and 3 
million jobs were created, even as inflation fell substantially.  This combination of 
outcomes reflects significant improvements in supply that offset to some extent the 
effects on demand of tighter financial conditions.  The healing of global supply chains 
helped address  pent-up demand for goods, particularly in sectors that had faced 
considerable shortages, such as autos.  In addition, labor supply increased significantly, 
thanks to rising participation among 25-to-54-year-olds, as well as a strong pace of 
immigration .  
Recent readings on both job gains  and inflation have come in  higher  than 
expected .  The economy added an average of 265,000 jobs per month in the three months 
through  February , a faster pace  than we have seen  since last June.  And the higher  - 2 - 
inflation data over January and February were above the low readings  in the second half 
of last year.   
The recent data do not, however, materially change the overall picture, which 
continues to be one of solid growth, a strong but rebalancing labor market, and inflation 
moving down to ward  2 percent on a sometimes  bumpy  path.  Labor market rebalancing is 
evident  in data on quits, job openings, surveys of employers and workers, and the 
continued gradual decline in wage growth.  On inflation, it is too soon to say whether the 
recent  readings represent more than just a bump.  We do not expect that it will be 
appropriate to lower our policy rate until we have greater confidence that inflation is 
moving sustainably down toward 2 percent.  Given the strength of the economy and 
progress o n inflation so far, we have time to let t he incoming data guide our decisions on 
policy.  
We have held our policy rate at its current level since last July.  As shown in the 
individual projections the FOMC  released two week s ago , my colleagues and I continue 
to believe that the policy rate  is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle.  If the economy 
evolves broadly as we expect, most FOMC participants see it as likely to be appropriate 
to begin lowering the policy rate at some point this year.   
Of course, the outlook is still quite uncertain, and we face risks  on both sides .  
Reducing rates too soon or too much could result in a reversal of the progress we have 
seen on inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to 
2 percent.  But easing  policy too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity 
and employment.  As progress on inflation continues and labor market tightness eases, 
these risks continue to move into better balance.    - 3 - 
As conditions evolve, m onetary policy is well positioned to confront either of 
these risks .  We are making decisions meeting by meeting, and we will do everything we 
can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.  
That brings me to my second topic.   The Fed has been assigned two goals for 
monetary policy —maximum employment and stable prices.  Our success in delivering on 
these goals matters a great deal to all Americans.  To support our pursuit of those goals,  
Congress granted the Fed a substantial degree of independence in our conduct of 
monetary policy.  Fed policymakers serve long terms that are not synchronized with 
election cycles.  Our decisions are not subject to reversal by other parts of the 
government, othe r than through legislation.  This independence both enables and requires 
us to make our monetary policy decisions  without consideration of short -term political 
matters.   Such independence for a federal agency is and should be rare.  In the case of the 
Fed, independence is essential to our ability to serve the public.  The record shows that 
independent central banks deliver better economic outcomes.1     
We recognize that we need to continually earn this grant of independence, and we 
do so by carrying out  our work with technical competence and objectivity , in a 
transparent and accountable manner, and by sticking to our knitting.    
By technical competence, I mean that Fed policymakers use the most up -to-date 
information and research to deepen our understanding of the ever -evolving economy and

to reliably deliver on our assigned goals .  We are supported by a highly capable staff.  
We also  draw on the insights and experiences of  a wide array of business , academic, 
community, and labor leaders , as well as  others engaged in the economy.  And by 
objective, I mean that our analysis is free from any personal or political bias, in service to 
the public.  We will not always get it right —no one does.  But our decisions will always 
reflect our painstaking assessment of what is best for our economy in the m edium and 
longer term —and nothing else.  
Transparency and accountability are fundamental for any government agency in a 
democracy but are especially important for one granted policy independence.  The Fed 
has a special obligation to explain ourselves clearly —to describe what we are doing and 
why we are doing it.  We are always striving to improve on this communication, and it is 
a job that is never complete .  But we have come a long way.  Before 1994, the FOMC did 
not even announce our monetary policy decisions.  Today we announce those decisions  
and explain the thinking behind them in our post meeting  statement and press conference.  
We publish detailed minutes of our deliberations and a quarterly summary of the 
economic and policy projections of each FOMC participant.  We publish a monetary 
policy report twice a year , and the Chair  appear s before Congress to present that report 
and answer any and all questions  that are on the minds of our oversight committee 
members .  In 2020, we completed a yearlong public review of our monetary policy 
framework , and late this year , we will begin another such review .2  My colleagues and I 
explain our views on the economic outlook and monetary policy in speeches like this one, 
and in visits to communities across the country, as part of extensive outreach in which we 
 
2 We expect to release the r esults of this review about a year after it begins.   - 5 - 
seek input from individuals and groups throughout society .  Transparency is an 
affirmative and proactive commitment to  the public .  
To maintain the public’s trust, we also need to avoid “mission creep.”   Our nation 
faces many challenges, some of which  directly or indirectly involve the economy.  Fed 
policymakers are often pressed to take a position on issues that are arguably relevant to 
the economy but are not within our mandate,  such as particular tax and spending polic ies, 
immigration policy, and trade policy .  Climate change is another current example.  
Policies to address climate change are the business of elected officials and those agencies 
that they have charged with this responsibility.  The Fed ha s received no such charge.  
We do, however, have a narrow role that relates to our responsibilities as a bank 
supervisor.  The public will expect that the institutions we regulate and supervise will 
understand and be able to manage the material risks that they face, which , over time , are 
likely to include climate -related financial risks.  We will remain alert to the risk that there 
will be pressure to expand that role over time.  We are not, nor do we seek to be, climate 
policymakers.  
In short, d oing our job well requires that we respect the limits  of our mandate . 
Thank you.   I look forward  to our discussion.  ",2024-04-03,powell

The Crisis as a Classic Financial Panic

I am very pleased to participate in this event in honor of Stanley Fischer.  Stan 
was my teacher in graduate school, and he has been both a role model and a frequent 
adviser ever since.  An  expert  on financial crises , Stan  has written prolifically on the 
subject and has also served on the front lines, so to speak--notably, in his role as the first deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund during the emerging  
market crises of the 1990s.  Stan also helped to fight hyperinflation in Israel in the 1980s and, as the governor of that nation’s central bank, deftly managed monetary policy to mitigate the effects of the recent crisis on the Israeli economy.  Subsequently, as Israeli housing prices ran upward, Stan became an advocate and early adopter of macroprudential policies to preserve financial stability.  
Stan frequently  counseled his students to take a historical perspective, which is 
good advi ce in general , but particularly helpful for understanding financial crises, which 
have been around a very long time.  Indeed, as I have noted elsewhere, I think the recent global crisis is best understood as a classic financial panic transposed into the novel institutional context of the 21st  century financial system.
1  An appreciation of the 
parallels between recent and historical events greatly influenced how I and many of my 
colleagues around the world responded to the crisis. 
Besides being the fifth anniversary of the most intense phase of the recent crisis, 
this year also marks the centennial of the founding of the Federal Reserve.2  It’s 
particularly appropriate to recall, therefore, that the Federal Reserve was itself created in

response to a sever e financial panic, the Panic of 1907.  This panic led to the creation of 
the National Monetary Commission, whose 1911 report was a major impetus to the 
Federal Reserve Act, signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson on December 23, 1913.  Because the Pani c of 1907 fit the archetype of a classic financial panic in many 
ways, it’s worth discussing its similaritie s and differences with the recent crisis.
3 
Like many other financial panics, including the most recent one, the Panic of 
1907 took place while the e conomy was weakening; according to the National Bureau of 
Economic Research, a recession had begun in May 1907.4  Also, as was characteristic of 
pre-Federal Reserve panics, money markets were tight when the panic struck in October, 
reflecting the strong se asonal demand for credit associated with the harvesting and 
shipment of crops.  The immediate trigger of the panic was a failed effort by a group of speculators to corner the stock of the United Copper Company.  The main perpetrators of the failed scheme, F. Augustus Heinze and C.F. Morse, had extensive connections with a number of leading financial institutions in New York City.  When the news of the failed speculation broke, depositor fears about the health of those institutions led to a series of runs on banks, including a bank at which Heinze served as president.  To try to restore confidence, the New York Clearinghouse , a private consortium of banks, reviewed the 
books of the banks under pressure, declared them solvent, and offered conditional 
                                                 
3 The Panic of 1907 is discussed in a number of sources, including O.M.W. Sprague  (1910),  A History of 
Crises u nder the National  Banking System , National Monetary Commission  (Washington:  U.S. 
Government Printing Office ), and, with a focus on its monetary consequences, Milton Friedman and Anna 
Jacobson Schwartz (1963), A Monetary History of the United States, 1867- 1960 (Princeton, N.J.:  Princeton 
University Press) .  An accessible discussion of the episode, from which this speech  draw s heavily, can be 
found in Jon  R. Moen and Ellis W. Tallman (1990) , “Lessons from the Panic of 1907,”  Federal Reserve 
Bank of Atlanta , Economic Review , May/June , pp. 2 -13,

support --one of the conditions being that Heinze and his board step down.  These steps 
were largely successful in stopping runs on the New York banks.   
But even as the banks stabilized, concerns intensified about the financial health of 
a number of so- called trust  companies --financial institutions that were less heavily 
regulated than national or state banks and which were not members of the Clearinghouse .  
As the runs on the trust companies worsened, the companies needed cash to meet the 
demand for withdrawals.  I n the absence of a central bank, New York’s leading 
financiers, led by J.P. Morgan, considered providing liquidity.  However, Morgan and his colleagues decided that they did not have sufficient information to judge the solvency of the affected institutions , so they declined to lend.  Overwhelmed by a run, the 
Knickerbocker Trust Company failed on October 22, undermining public confidence in the remaining trust companies.   
To satisfy their depositors’ demands for cash, the trust companies began to sell or 
liquidate assets, including loans made to finance stock purchases.  The selloff of shares 
and other assets, in what today we would call a fire sale, precipitated a sharp decline in the stock market and widespread disruptions in other financial markets.  Inc reasingly 
concerned, Morgan and other financiers (including the future governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Benjamin Strong) led a coordinated response that included the provision of liquidity through the Clearinghouse and the imposition of te mporary 
limits on depositor withdrawals, including withdrawals by correspondent banks in the interior of the country.  These efforts eventually calmed the panic.  By then, however, the U.S. financial system had been severely disrupted, and the economy cont racted through 
the middle of 1908.  - 4 - 
The recent crisis echoed many aspects of the 1907 panic.  Like most crises, the 
recent episode had an identifiable trigger --in this case,  the growing realization by market 
participants that subprime mortgages and certain other credits were seriously deficient in 
their underwriting and disclosures.  As the economy slowed and housing prices declined, diverse financial institutions, including many of the largest and most internationally active firms, suffered credit losses th at were clearly large but also hard for outsiders to 
assess.  Pervasive uncertainty about the size and incidence of losses in turn led to sharp withdrawals of short -term funding from a wide range of institutions ; these funding 
pressures precipitated fire s ales, which  contributed to sharp declines in asset prices and 
further losses .  Institutional changes over the past century were reflected in differences in 
the types of funding that ran:  In 1907, in the absence of deposit insurance, retail deposits were m uch more prone to run, whereas  in 2008, most withdrawals were of uninsured 
wholesale funding, in the form of commercial paper, repurchase agreements, and 
securities lending.  Interestingly, a steep decline in interbank lending, a form of wholesale funding, was important in both episodes.  Also interesting is that the 1907 panic involved institutions --the trust companies --that faced relatively less regulation, which probably 
contributed to their rapid growth in the years leading up to the panic.  In analogous fashion, in the recent crisis, much of the panic occurred outside the perimeter of traditional bank regulation, in the so- called shadow banking sector.

defined, comprises a diverse set of institutions and markets that, collectively, carry out tradi tional banking 
functions --but do so outside, or in ways only loosely linked to, the traditional system of regulated 
depository institutions.   Examples of important components of the shadow banking system include 
securitization vehicles, asset -backed commer cial paper conduits, money market funds, markets for 
repurchase agreements, investment banks, and mortgage companies.   - 5 - 
The responses to the panics of 1907 and 2008 also provide instructive 
comparisons.  In both cases, the provision of liquidity in the early stages was crucial.  In 
1907 the United States had no central bank, so the availability of liquidity depended on the discretion of firms and private individuals, like Morgan.  In the more recent crisis, the Federal Res erve fulfilled the role of liquidity provider, consistent with the classic 
prescriptions of Walter Bagehot.
6  The Fed lent not only to banks , but, seeking to stem 
the panic in wholesale funding markets, it also extended its lender -of-last-resort facilities  
to support nonbank institutions, such as investment banks and money market funds, and key financial markets, such as those for commercial paper and asset -backed securities.  
In both episodes, though, liquidity provision was only the first step.  Full 
stabi lization requires the restoration of public confidence.  Three basic tools for restoring 
confidence are temporary public or private guarantees, measures to strengthen financial institutions’ balance sheets, and public disclosure of the conditions of financ ial firms.  At 
least to some extent, Morgan and the New York Clearinghouse used these tools in 1907, giving assistance to troubled firms and providing assurances to the public about the conditions of individual banks.  All three tools were used extensively  in the recent crisis:  
In the United States, guarantees included the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC) guarantees of bank debt, the Treasury Department’s guarantee of money market 
funds, and the private guarantees offered by stronger firms that acquired weaker ones.  Public and private capital injections strengthened bank balance sheets.  Finally, the bank stress tests that the Federal Reserve led in the spring of 2009 and the publication of the stress- test findings helped restore confidence i n the U.S. banking system.  Collectively, 
                                                 
6 See Bagehot, Lombard Street , in note 1.   - 6 - 
these measures helped end the acute phase of the financial crisis, although, five years 
later, the economic consequences are still with us. 
Once the fire is out, public attention turns to the question of how to bet ter 
fireproof the system.  Here, the context and the responses differed between 1907 and the recent crisis.  As I mentioned, following the 1907 crisis, reform efforts led to the founding of the Federal Reserve, which was charged both with helping to prevent panics and, by providing an “elastic currency,” with smoothing seasonal interest rate fluctuations.  In contrast, reforms since 2008 have focused on critical regulatory gaps revealed by the crisis.  Notably, oversight of the shadow banking system is being strengthened through the designation, by the new Financial Stability Oversight Council, of nonbank systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) for consolidated  
supervision by the Federal Reserve, and measures are being undertaken to address the 
potential instability of wholesale funding, including reforms to money market funds and 
the triparty repo market.

As we try to make the financial system safer, we must inevitably confront the 
problem of moral hazard.  The actions taken by central banks and other authorities to stabilize a panic in the short run can work against stability in the long run, if investors and firms infer from those actions that they will never bear the full consequences of excessive risk -taking.  As Stan Fischer reminded us following the international crises of 
the late 1990s, the problem of moral hazard has no perfect solution, but steps c an be

taken to limit it.8  First, regulatory and supervisory reforms, such as higher capital and 
liquidity standards or restriction on certain activities, can directly limit risk -taking.  
Second, through the use of appropriate carrots and sticks, regulator s can enlist the private 
sector in monitoring risk -taking.  For example, the Federal Reserve’s Comprehensive 
Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process, the descendant of the bank stress tests of 
2009, requires not only that large financial institutions ha ve sufficient capital to weather 
extreme shocks , but also that they demonstrate that their internal risk -management 
systems are effective.9  In addition, the results of the stress -test portion of CCAR are 
publicly disclosed, providing investors and analyst s information they need to assess 
banks’ financial strength.  
Of course, market discipline can only limit moral hazard to the extent that debt 
and equity holders believe that, in the event of distress, they will bear costs.  In the crisis, the absence of an  adequate resolution process for dealing with a failing SIFI left 
policymakers with only the terrible choices of a bailout or allowing a potentially destabilizing collapse.  The Dodd- Frank Act, under the orderly l iquidation a uthority  in 
Title II, created an alternative resolution mechanism for SIFIs that takes into account both the need, for moral hazard reasons, to impose costs on the creditors of failing firms and the need to protect financial stability; the FDIC, with the cooperation of the Federal 
Reser ve, has been hard at work fleshing out this authority.

mechanism for systemically important firms will be important for reducing uncertainty, 
enhancing market discipline, and reducing moral hazard.  
Our continuing challenge is to make financial crises far less likely and , if they 
happen, far less costly.  The task is complicated by the reality that every financial panic has its own unique features that depend on a particular historical context and the details of the institutional s etting.  But, as Stan Fischer has done with unusual skill throughout 
his career, one can, by stripping away the idiosyncratic aspects of individual crises, hope to reveal the common elements.  In 1907, no one had ever heard of an asset -backed 
security, and  a single private individual could command the resources needed to bail out 
the banking system ; and yet, fundamentally, the Panic of 1907 and the Panic of 2008 
were instances of the same phenomenon, as I have discussed today.  The challenge for policymaker s is to identify and isolate the common factors of crises , thereby allow ing us 
to prevent crises when possible and to respond effectively when not.

60th Annual Meeting of the National Association for Business Economics

ctober 2, 2018  
It is a pleasure and an honor to speak here today at the 60th Annual Meeting of 
the National Association for Business Economics (NABE).  Since 1959 , NABE has 
promoted the use of economics in the workplace and advanced the worthy purpose of 
ensuring that leading American  businesses benefit from the insights of economist s. 
Today I will focus on the Federal Reserve’s ongoing effort s to promote maximum 
employment and stable prices.  I am pleased to say that , by these measures,  the economy 
looks  very good.  The unemployment rate stands at 3.9 percent, near a 20 -year low.  
Inflation is currently running near the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) 
objective of 2 percent.  While these two top -line statistics do not always present an 
accurate picture of  overall  economic conditions, a wide range of data on jobs and prices 
support s a positive view.  In addition, many forecasters are predicting that th ese favorable 
conditions  are likely to  continue .  For example, the medians of the most recent 
projections from FOMC participants and the  Survey of Professional Forecasters, as well 
as the most recent Congressional Budget Office (CBO) forecast,  all have the 
unemployment rate remaining below 4 percent through the end of 2020, with inflation 
staying very near 2 percent over the same period.1   
From the standpoint of our  dual mandate, this is a remarkably positive outlook.  
Indeed, I was asked at last week’s press conference whether these forecasts are too good 
to be true --a reasonable question!  Since 1950, the U.S. econom y has experienced periods  
of low, stable inflation and periods of very low unemployment, but never both for such 
                                                 
1 I am referring to the most recent forecast for year -end 2018 through 2020.  The unemployment rate for 
each forecast bottoms out at 3.4 percent or 3.5 percent in 2019 and remains below 4 percent.  Headline PCE 
(personal consumption expenditures) inflation is between 1.9 percent and 2.1 percent for all three years and 
forecasts.  The sources for the forecast data are given in the notes to figure 1.    - 2 - 
an extended time as is seen in these forecasts.2  Standard economic thinking has long 
offered an explanation for this:  If unemployment were to  remain this low for this long, 
employers would be pushing up wages as they compete for scarce workers, and rising  
labor costs would feed into more -rapid price inflation faced by consumers.    
This dynamic between unemployment and inflation is known as a P hillips curve  
relation ship, and at times it can pose a fundamental tension between the two sides of the 
Fed’s mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.  Recent low 
inflation and unemployment have some analysts asking, “Is the Phillips curv e dead?”3  
Others argue that the Phillips curve still lurks  in the background and could reemerge at 
any time to  exact revenge for low unemployment in the form of high inflation.   
My comments today have two main objectives.  The first is to explain how 
changes in the Phillips curve help account for the somewhat surprising but broadly shared 
current forecasts of continued very low unemployment with inflation near 2 percent.  At 
the risk  of spoiling the surprise, I do not see it as likely that the Phillips curve is dead , or 
that it will soon exact revenge.  What is more likely, in my view, is that many factors, 
including better conduct of monetary policy over the past few decades, have greatly 
reduced, but not eliminated, the effect s that  tight labor markets  have on inflation.   
However, no one fully understands the nature of these changes or the role they play in the 
                                                 
2 For example, there have been four periods with quarterly average unemployment below 4 percent since 
1950.  In an early 1950s episode, inflation ranged from below zero to 8 percent.  Toward the end of the 
1950s, unemployment was near 4 percent for a time, dipping to 3.9 percent for one quarter.  During this 
low unemployment period, inflation rose steadily from under 1 percent to over 3 percent.  The remaining 
two episodes with unemployment under 4 percent --one each in the 1960s and 1990s --are discussed later in 
the speech.  
3 This question is asked in the title of a recent editorial by Alan Blinder (2018), and a G oogle search reveals 
many similar titles.  The research on the topic is reviewed more fully later in the speech.     - 3 - 
current context .  Common sense suggests we should beware when forecasts predict 
events seldom before observed in the economy.4    
Thus, my seco nd objective today is to explain, given this uncertainty about the 
unemployment -inflation relationship, the important role that risk manag ement plays in 
setting monetary policy.  I will explore the FOMC’s monitoring and balancing of risks as 
well as our co ntingency planning for cases when risk becomes reality . 
Historical P erspective on Jobs and Inflation  
Let us start with a look at the modern history of jobs and inflation in the United 
States.  Figure 1 shows headline inflation and unemployment from 1960 to today and 
extended through 2020 using the average of median projection s from  both FOMC 
participants  and the Survey of Professional Forecasters, and the CBO projections .  As the 
figure makes clear, a  multiyear period with unemployment below 4 percent and s table 
inflation  would, if realized, be  unique  in modern U.S. data .5   
To understand the basis for these forecasts, it is useful to contrast two very  
different periods included in  figure  1: From 1960  to 1985, and the period from 1995 to 
today.  The first period includes the Great Inflation, and t he latter includes both the Great 
Moderation and the distinctly immoderate period of the G lobal F inancial Crisis and its 
aftermath.   
Figure 2 shows unemployment  and core, rather than headline, inflation in these 
two periods.  While our inflation objective concerns headline inflation, s witching to core 
                                                 
4 Herb Stein (1998) made the analogous point that one should doubt the assertion that some program will 
“cause the economy to perform outside the range of its past experience” (p. 217).  
5 See note 2.  Unless otherwise noted, all statements about inflation will be four -quarter percent changes in 
quarterly average data, and all statements about unemployment will be about the quarterly average 
unemployment rate.    - 4 - 
inflation makes some relationships clearer by remov ing a good deal of variability  due to 
food and energy prices, variability that is not primarily driven by labor mar ket conditions 
or monetary policy.   
There is a dramatic differen ce in the unemployment -inflation relation ship across 
these two periods.  During the Great Inflation, unemployment fluctuated between roughly 
4 percent and 10 percent, and inflation moved over  a similar range.   In the recent period, 
the unemployment rate also fluctuated between roughly 4 percent and 10 percent, but 
inflation has been relatively  tame , averaging 1.7 percent and never declining below 
1 percent or rising to 2.5 percent.  Even during the financial crisis, core inflation barely 
budged.  As a thought experiment, look at the right panel and i magine that you could see 
only the red line  (inflation),  and not the blue line  (unemployment) .  Nothing in the red 
line hints at a major economic e vent, let alone the immense upheaval around the time of 
the global financial crisis.  
Notice that, in each period, there is only one episode  in which unemployment  
drops  below 4 percent .  In the late 1960s, unemployment remained at or below 4 percent 
for fo ur years , and during that time inflation rose steadily from under 2 percent to almost 
5 percent .  By contrast, t he late 1990s episode of below -4-percent  unemployment was 
quite  brief, and  during the episode and surrounding quarters inflation was reasonably 
stable and remained below  2 percent.   
To explore the Phillips curve relation ship in these two periods more closely, we  
need to bring in the concept of the natural rate of unemployment.  In standard economic 
thinking, an unemployment rate above the natural  rate indicates slack in the labor market 
and tends to be associated with downward pressure on inflation; unemployment below  - 5 - 
the natural rate represents a tight labor market and is associated with upward inflation 
pressure.      
Figure 3 repeats figure 2 b ut replaces unemployment with labor market slack  as 
measured by unemployment minus the CBO ’s current estimate of the natural rate of 
unemployment  at each point in time .6  Periods of tight labor markets are shaded.  During 
the Great Inflation, inflation generally rose in the tight, shaded periods and fell in the 
unshaded ones , just as conventional Phillips curve reasoning predicts .   
From 1995 to today, the large and persistent swings in the gap between 
unemployment  and the natural rate w ere associated with,  at most, a move of a few tenths 
in the inflation rate.  Comparing the shaded and unshaded regions, you might see some 
association between slack and the minor ups and downs i n inflation, but the pattern is not 
at all consistent.   It is evidence like this t hat fuels speculation about the Phillips curve’s 
demise.     
Whether dead, sick, or merely resting, many of the questions about the Phillips 
curve come down to figuring out what changed between these two periods , and why.  Let  
us turn to a conceptual frame work for examining these questions more systematically.  
A Simple F ramework for U nderstanding C hanges in the Jobs -Inflation R elation ship 
A natural starting point is the simplest form of a Phillips curve equation, which  
posits that inflation this year is de termined by some combination of current labor market 
                                                 
6 This estimate is the CBO’s current assessment of what the natural rate was at each period in the sample, 
not a measure of the natural rate as perceived in real time.  I discuss the importance of this distinction in 
Powell (2018).   - 6 - 
slack, inflation last year, and some other factors that I will leave aside for this discussion 
(figure 4) :7 
Inflation(t ) = -B Slack( t) + C  Inflation( t - 1) + Other(t). 
The value of B  is often referred to as the slope of the Phillips curve.  With  a larger 
value of B , any change in labor market slack translates into a bigger change  in inflation.  
As we say, as B increases, the Phillips curve steepe ns.  The value of C  determines 
inflatio n’s persistence-- that is, how long any given change in inflation tends to linger.  As 
the value of C  increases, higher inflation this year translates more into higher inflation 
next year .  A particularly nasty case arises when B  and C  are both large.  In t his case, 
slack has a large effect on inflation, and that effect tends to be very persistent.  One 
implication of a large C  is that, if a boom drives inflation up, it will tend to stay up unless 
offset by a subsequent bust .8    
Figure 5 shows regression estimates of B  and C , computed over 20- year samples 
starting with the sample from  1965 to 1984 and including each 20- year sample through 
2017.  During the Great Inflation samples, the value of C  is near 1, meaning that higher 
inflation on e year tended to translate almost one- for-one into higher inflation the next.  
The Phillips curve is also relatively steep in the Great Inflation samples, with 1  extra 
percentage point of lower  unemployment converting into roughly 1/2 percentage point of 
higher  inflation.  Thus, the Great Inflation presented that nasty case just described.   
                                                 
7 Wha t is reported here is an updated version of results reported in Erceg and others (2018), and that work 
provides additional discussion.  Note that the “Other” term includes a constant.  
8 The text refers to when C is less than 1, in which case a rise in inflation would ultimately die out on its 
own.  When C is 1, the Phillips curve is of the “accelerationist” variety, and any offsetting rise in inflation 
due to labor market tightness would be permanent unless offset  by an equal amount of subsequent slack.  
Blanchard (2016) has a good discussion of this issue.   - 7 - 
Fortunately, things changed.  The estimates of both B  and C  fall in value as the 
estimation sample shifts forward in time.  In the most recent samples, the Phillips cur ve is 
nearly flat, with B very near zero, and C  is about 0.25, meaning that roughly one fourth of 
any rise or fall in inflation carries forward.  These results give numerical form to  what we 
see in the right -hand panel of f igure 3, covering the recent period:  Large and persistent 
moves in the unemployment gap were associated with, at most, modest transitory moves 
in inflation.   
What L ed to the C hanges in the Phillips curve?  
These developments amount to a better world for households and businesses, 
which no longer experience or even fear the scourge of high and volatile inflation.  To 
provide a sound basis for monetary policy, it is important to understand what happened 
and why, so we can avoid a return to the bad old days of the 1970s.  Like many, I believe 
better monetary policy has played a central role.9    
To understand the mechanism, let us ask how central banks could, presumably 
inadvertently, amplify and extend the duration of inflation’s response to labor market 
tightness.  To do so, the central bank c ould persistent ly ease the stance of monetary 
policy in response to an uptick in inflation.  No responsible central banker today would 
intentionally do this , but much research suggests that  during the Great Inflation, 
misunderstandings about how the economy worked led the Fed effectively to behave in 
this manner.10  Some policymakers may have belie ved the misguided notion that  
                                                 
9 The account I present of the role of anchored expectations in stabilizing the economy and favorably 
altering Phillips curve dynamics echoes a long -held view a t the Fed.  See Bernanke (2007) and Yellen 
(2015).   Kiley (2015) reviews the recent research literature on this topic.  Blanchard (2016) presents a very 
similar perspective.  
10 To be clear, during the periods of rising inflation in the 1960s and 1970s, the  FOMC was generally 
raising the federal funds rate, but with inflation rising, the real federal funds rate was rising much more 
slowly or even falling.  In this sense, the effective stance of policy was tightening slowly or was easing.   - 8 - 
accommodating permanently higher inflation could purchase permanently higher 
employment.11  Other  policymakers  misperceived the level of the natural rate of 
unemployment, which we now believe  had shifted up markedly in the 1960s.  With the 
higher natural rate, the labor market was much tighter  and provided much greater upward 
pressure on inflation than policymakers  realized in real time .  As a result, they were 
continually “behind the curve .”12   
The channel through which monetar y policy can amplify and extend inflation’s  
response to shocks becomes even stronger when we take account of expectations.  If 
people come to expect that upward blips in inflation will result in ongoing higher 
inflation , they will build that view into wage  and price decisions.  In this case, people’s 
expectations become a force adding momentum to inflation, and breaking inflation’s 
momentum can require convincing people to change their minds and behavior --never an  
easy task.  Arguably, this is why a federal  funds rate near 20 percent --roughly 10 percent  
in real terms --was required in the early 1980s to turn the tide on high inflation.  The cost, 
in the form of very high unemployment, is clear in the Great Inflation figures.  
The Great Inflation taught us tha t a main task of monetary policy is to keep inflation 
expectations anchored at some low level.   
This idea is behind the adoption in recent decades of inflation targets, such as the 
Fed’s 2 percent objective, by central banks around the world.  When moneta ry policy 
tends to offset shocks  to inflation , rather than amplifying and extending them, and when 
people come to expect this  policy response , a surprise rise or fall in labor market 
tightness will naturally have smaller and less persistent effects on inflation .  Research 
                                                 
11 Romer and Romer ( 2002) make this argument.  
12 I discuss this argument in greater depth in Powell (2018).   - 9 - 
suggests that this reasoning can account for a good deal of the change in the Phillips 
curve relationship.13 It is also likely that many other factors have contributed to changes 
in inflation dynamics over recent decades .  We do not ful ly understand the causes and 
implications of these changes, which raises risk management issues that I will take up 
now.14  
A Favorable Outlook, but What  Could G o Wrong ? 
To set the stage, let  us return to the situation facing the FOMC.  The baseline 
forecast s of most FOMC participants and a broad range of others  show unemployment 
remaining below 4 percent for an extended period, with inflation steady near 2 percent.  I 
have made the case that t his forecast is not too good to be true  and does not  signal the 
death of the Phillips curve.  Instead, the outlook is consistent with evidence of a very flat 
Phillips curve and inflation expectations anchored near 2 percent.   
But we still must face the cautionary advice to beware when  forecasts point to 
rarely seen out comes.  As a way of h eeding this advice, the Committee takes a risk 
management approach, which has three important parts:  monitoring risks; balancing 
risks, both upside and downside; and contingency planning for surprises.  Let me 
describe a few of the ri sks and how we are thinking about them.  
Could I nflation E xpectations B ecome U nanchored?  
First is the risk that inflation expectations might lose their anchor.  We  attribute a 
great deal of the stability of inflation in recent years to the anchoring of longer -term 
                                                 
13 Yellen (2017) gives a more detailed account of how a very flat Phillips curve with anchored expectations 
can account well for the recent inflation and unemployment dat a.  See also note 9.  
14 Many changes not directly related to policy might  nonetheless have been precipitated by the 
improvement in policy.  For example, Pfajfar and Roberts, (2018) present evidence that when inflation is 
more stable, people simply pay less attention to it and that this could help account for changes in the 
Phillips curve relationship.   - 10 - 
inflation expectations .  And we  are aware that it could be very costly if those expectations 
were to drift materially .  As you probably know from our public communications , we 
carefully monitor survey - and market -based proxies for expectations , and we do not see 
evidence of a material shift in longer -term expectations ( figure 6).  T he survey measures 
have been particularly steady for some time.15  The financial market -based measures 
include both an expectations component and a volatile inflation premium component, so 
they tend to move around much more than the surveys, but we see no evidence of a 
material change in these measures, either.   
The risks to inflation expectations are, of course, two sided .  Until this summer, 
inflation had remained stubbornly below 2 percent for several years.  And major 
economies in much of the world have been struggling mainly with disinflationary forces.  
Thus, we have been and will remain alert for  possibl e downward drift in expect ations.  
Some argue the contrary case-- that by only gradually removing accommodation as the 
unemployment rate has fallen, the FOMC may have fall en behind the curve, thereby 
risking an upward drift in expectations.  From the standpoint of contingency planni ng, 
our course is clear:  R esolutely conduct  policy consistent with the FOMC’s symmetric 2 
percent inflation  objective, and stand ready to act with authority if expectations drift  
materially up or down. 
Could I nflation Pressures Move up More than Expected in a Hot Economy? 
A second risk is that labor market tightness or tightness i n other parts of the  
production chain might lead to higher inflation pressure than expected --the “revenge of 
                                                 
15 That is, movements in these measures have been modest, especially taking into account precision of the

the Phillips curve” scenario.16  As I mentioned, t he FOMC carefully mon itors a wide 
array of early indicators of inflation pressure  to evaluate this risk .  Wages and 
compensation data are one important source of information.  These measures have picked 
up some recently, but in a way that is quite welcome.  Specifically, the r ise in wages is 
broadly consistent with observed rates of price inflation and labor productivity growth 
and therefore does not point to an overheating labor market .  Further, higher wage growth 
alone need not be inflationary.  The late 1990s episode of low  unemployment saw wages 
rise faster than inflation plus productivity growth without an appreciable rise in inflation.   
Despite what shows up in the aggregate wage and compensation  data, however , I 
am sure that, like us, many of you are hearing widespread anecdotes about labor 
shortages and increasing bottlenecks in production.  For example, as shown in f igure 7, 
the words “shortage” and  “bottleneck” are increasingly appearing in the Beige Book, the 
Federal Reserve’s report summarizing discussions with our b usiness contacts around the 
country.17  The message we are hearing in our conversations is supported by a wide range 
of more conventional measures.  For example, the survey of members of the National 
Federation of Independent Business finds firms increasing ly reporting that job openings 
are hard to fill (f igure 8 ).  Further, these businesses now list “ quality of labor” as their 
most important problem, as opposed to the more typical report  of “poor sales.”   
We review a wide variety of measures of this type, and these indicators  show 
what I think most business people see:  an  economy operating with limited slack.  Notice, 
                                                 
16 Gordon (2018) presents one version of the revenge hypothesis.  
17 The length of the Beige Book has varied somewhat over time; for example, the Beige Book was 
redesigned in 2017, with the number of words reduced about 10 percent.  It is unclear whether the number 
of important words like “shortage” would have been affected by that redesign, but if so, it would go in the 
direction of holding down the observed recent increase.   - 12 - 
however, that the se measures are near levels that prevailed in the late 1990s or early 
2000s , a period when core inflation remained under 2 percent.   
While the late  1990s case proves that elevated values of these tightness measures 
do not automatically  translate into rising inflation, a single episode provides only limited 
reassurance.   Thus, the FOMC takes seriously the possibility that tight  markets for labor 
or other inputs could provide greater upward pressure on inflation than in the baseline 
outlook.  Our best estimates, however, s uggest  that so long as inflation expectations 
remain anchored, a modest steepening of the Phillips curve woul d be unlikely to c ause a 
significant rise in inflation or demand a disruptive policy tightening.18  Once again, the 
key is the anchored expectations.  
Is the N atural R ate of Unemployment L ower T han E xpected?  
A third risk --in this case an upside risk --is that the natural rate of unemployment 
could be even  lower than current estimates .  Some have argued that the Fed should be 
removing policy accommodation much more slowly, pushing the economy to see if the 
natural rate of unemployment is lower still.  
Advocates  of this view note that over the past several years of policy 
normalization, the  economy has continued to strengthen and unemployment has fallen, 
but inflation has remained quiet.  As I discussed in a recent speech, many  analysts have 
accounted for the lac k of rising inflation pressure by lowering their estimate of the natural 
rate.19  For example, since the start of 2016, the unemployment rate has fallen about 1 
percentage point, and estimates of the natural rate from  four well -known sources have 
fallen ove r that period between 0.3 percent and 0.7 percent ( figure  9).   
                                                 
18 See, for example, Erceg and others (2018).  
19 See Powell (2018).   - 13 - 
If the natural rate is now materially lower than we believe, that would imply  less 
upward pressure on inflation-- the flip side of the “revenge of the Phillips curve” risk.  
Our policy of gradual interest rate normalization represents the FOMC’s attempt to take 
both of these risks seriously.  Removing accommodation too quickly could needlessly 
foreshorten the expansion.  Moving too slowly could risk rising inflation and inflation 
expectations.  Our path of gradually removing accommodation , while closely monitoring 
the economy, is designed to balance these risks.  
In wrapping up this discussion of risks to the favorable outlook, I should 
emphasize that I have chosen to focus on three risks that are all associated with the 
Phillips curve.  There are, of course, myriad other risks.  To name just a few, we must 
consider the strength of economies abroad, the effects of ongoing trade disputes, and 
financial stability issues.  I hope my discussion of three particular risks gives a sense of 
how we approach these issues.  
Conclusion 
Many of us have been looking back recently on the decade that has passed since 
the depth s of the financial crisis.  In light of that experience, I am glad to be able to stand 
here and say that the economy is strong, unemployment is near 50- year lows, and 
inflation is roughly at our 2 percent objective.  The baseline outlook of forecasters inside 
and outside the Fed is for more of the same.   
This historically rare pairing of steady, low inflation and very low unemployment 
is testament to  the fact that we remain in extraordinary times.  Our ongoing policy of 
gradual interest rate normalization reflects our efforts to balance  the inevitable risks  that  - 14 - 
come with extraordinary times , so as to extend the current expansion , while maintaining 
maximum employment and low and stable inflation.

March 31, 2023 
  
Thanks to President K asey Buckles and the program committee for affording me 
the opportunity to give the C. Woody Thompson Memorial Lecture.   It is a pleasure to be 
back in the Midwest.  Before  joining the Federal Reserve, I taught economics at 
Michigan State University, which  I chose for its bird ’s-eye view of the industrial 
Midwest.  Big 10 rivalries aside, Ohio and Michigan share quite a lot, including many of 
the same economic concerns and interests .  
Today I would like to outline my view s on the trajectory of U.S. economic 
developments and what th ey imply  for the appropriate path of monetary policy.1 
This is a n especially  challenging time to be an  economic analyst or policymaker.  
Recent developments in the banking sector have added to e xisting uncertainties about 
recovery from the pandemic shock and developments abroad.  In that context, the 
economic and policy outlook needs to balance data dependence with forward -looking 
analysis.  Recent data show greater momentum in inflation and econo mic activity, but 
recent banking developments  may suggest greater headwinds for financial conditions and 
the economy going forward.  
The U .S. economy  
Assessing the current state of the economy requires revisiting the pandemic and 
its economic repercussions.   From the perspective of the NBER Business Cycle Dating 
Committee, the 2020 recession was unprecedented.   Of the 35 recessions since 1858, only 
8 spanned months in the single digits from peak to trough.  The one in 2020 was severe, 
but it spanned only two months from peak to trough and was the shortest recession on 
record.  
 
1 These views are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Board or 
the Federal Open Market Committee.   - 2 - 
However, the pandemic’s economic effects reverberated through 2021 and 2022 .  
Inflation  surged during the recovery amid pandemic -induced disruptions to supply, while 
demand for goods was  boosted by a shift away from in-person services , and overall 
demand was supported by monetary and fiscal policy .  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 
February 2022 was a further supply shock to the global economy, driving up prices for 
energy and other commod ities.  Last June, U .S. inflation hit a peak of 7 percent as 
measured by the 12-month change in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) 
index.  
In response, the Federal Reserve has been using its monetary  policy tools to 
restore price stability by bringing demand into line with still-constrained supply.  Over 
the past year, we have rais ed the federal funds rate nearly 5 percentage points and have 
begun to reduc e the size of our balance sheet.  
As a result, f inancial conditions have tightened significantly.  Borrowing costs 
have risen, equity prices have declined, and the dollar has appreciated on net.  
Interest -sensitive sectors of the economy have slowed.  Residential investment 
subtracted nearly 1 percentage point from gross domestic product  growth last year, as 
housing demand was curtailed by higher mortgage rates.  Business fixed investment held 
up last year but appears to have slowed more recently.   Manufacturing activity has 
slowed in response to tighter financing conditions, the stronger dollar, and some retracement of the pandemic-related  shift from services to goods.  
As energy prices have moderated and supply disruptions have eased, inflation has 
started to abate.  However,  the process of returning infl ation to 2 percent has a long way 
to go and is likely to be uneven and bumpy.   - 3 - 
Indeed , the inflation picture is less favorable than it appeared earlier this year.  
Part of the encouraging disinflation initially observed in the fourth quarter of last year 
was revised away, while inflation over the first two months of this year came in high . 
The inflation data show some persistence.  The 3 -, 6-, and 12-month changes in 
February prices for the core PCE index —excluding food and energy —are all around 4½ 
to 5 perc ent.  Housing services inflation continues at a rapid monthly clip, contributing 
much  more to inflation than it did before  the pandemic.  Inflation in non -housing core 
services remains sticky at elevated levels.  Even core goods prices rose in January and 
February, after three months of declines, highlighting the uneven nature of the 
disinflationary process.  
Even so, several factors are likely to contribute to disinflation.  Long -term 
inflation expectations remain well anchored, and shorter -term expectations have retraced 
much of last year’s rise.2  Rent  increases on new leases have slowed sharply over the past 
six months, which should begin to pull down measured housing -services inflation over 
the course of this year.  Moreover, significan t supply of multifamily housing is coming 
online, which should take further pressure off the rental market.  
Core goods inflation should continue converging toward its pre -pandemic trend of 
slightly negative numbers, as supply chains continue to heal  and de mand for goods 
continues to slow .  Rebounding automobile production should help prices for new and 
used cars continue to moderate  as cars become more available.  More broadly in the 
economy, profit margins may narrow  as buyers become more price  sensitive a nd pull

New York.   - 4 - 
back on spending.   Earnings calls from nonfinancial corporations already show increasing 
awareness of resistance to price increases.  
Non-housing core services inflation is a broad category that accounts for more 
than half of the core PCE index.   Inflation in that category looks quite persistent amid 
strong post -pandemic demand for travel, dining out, and medical care.   Disinflation in 
these services will likely require some combination of slowing demand and further 
recovery in supply.  
One potential avenue of disinflation is that a decline  in prices for some goods may 
help lower related services prices.  For instance, an eventual retreat in car prices may feed 
into lower prices for car insurance, repairs, and rentals, reversing some of their  increases  
over the past two years.   
Another potential source of disinflation is that wage growth has moderated 
somewhat , even as the labor market remains very strong by most measures.  Payroll 
employment growth was extraordinarily robust in January and F ebruary, unemployment 
remains near record lows, and job openings remain very elevated.   
Nonetheless, there are some signs that the labor market is softening at the margin.  
The Federal Reserve Board staff’s measure of private employment using data from the payroll processing firm ADP suggests that job gains slowed in January and February.  
Job postings from Indeed show a  noticeable  decline.  And the quits rate has retraced more 
than half of its pandemic -era rise, falling steadily from a 3  percent peak in l ate 2021 to 
2.5 percent in January.   That could be significant, as much of the surge in wage growth a 
year ago may have been driven by outsized wage gains of those changing jobs and by employers raising wages to retain existing workers.   - 5 - 
This wage moderatio n may partly reflect some improvement in labor supply.  
Labor force participation edged up to 62.5 percent in the most recent data.  Prime -age 
participation is now back to pre -pandemic levels.  In addition, new estimates show higher 
population growth over the past year amid  a rebound in immigration.  
Over time, there is reason to believe that rising productivity also may aid supply.  
I see three potential sources of rising productivity growth.  
First, increased innovation associated with the spurt of new businesses since the 
onset of the pandemic may raise  productivity.  Second, current labor shortages are 
spurring increased investment in automation that should boost labor productivity over 
time.   Finally, a recent paper by David Autor, Arin Dube, and Annie McGrew suggests 
another way that the strong labor market could boost productivity.3  They find that faster 
wage gains for lower -paid workers have come from job-switching to higher -wage firms, 
which may also be more -productive firms.  
Currently, however, supply in the economy continues to be insufficient to meet 
still-robust demand.  Importantly, consumer spending has gained steam this year after 
slowing late last year.  Consumer spending is being supported by robust growth in 
households’ real disposable income amid strong employment growth.  Strong household 
balance sheets have also supported spending, although lower -income consumers appear 
to have mostly exhausted their excess savings.  
Altogeth er, the incoming data  would suggest a somewhat higher inflation rate for 
this year and stronger economic growth.  However, I am closely watching developments

in the banking sector, which have the potential to tighten credit conditions and counteract 
some o f that momentum.  
The U .S. banking system is sound and resilient.  The Federal Reserve, working 
with other agencies, has taken decisive actions to protect the U .S. economy and to 
strengthen public confidence in our banking system.  We will continue to close ly monitor 
conditions in the banking system and are prepared to use all our tools, as needed, to keep 
the system safe and sound.  
At the same time, I am monitoring overall financial conditions in the U .S. 
economy,  including  indicators of credit availability .  I am well aware of the extensive 
literature linking monetary policy, credit conditions, economic activity, and inflation.  
Over the past 15 years, that literature came to be roughly a quarter of the syllabus in the 
macroeconomics class that I taught.  
A particular focus over my career , including in my December NBER paper with 
Matt Marx and Emmanuel Yimfor , is the importance of s maller financial institutions in 
lending to small and medium -sized firms .4  Those smaller banks over time have 
developed  relevant expertise in small-business lending and have worked to maintain 
relationships  with small firms .  Thus, I am attentive to whether recent banking 
developments will restrain credit to small businesses, which could slow innovation and 
growth in potential output over time.

Data dependence and monetary policy  
Turning to monetary policy, I have said frequently that my approach to 
policymaking in uncertain times is to be data  dependent.  And, like everyone, my own 
research and experiences shape my views on setting that policy.  I was at the Council of 
Economic Advisers during the euro-area crisis , and my work on emerging economies —
particularly Russia and some African economies —has taught me how difficult it can be 
to forecast in highly uncertain environme nts.  
Taking all these lessons into account, I approach all our monetary policy 
discussions with the same mindset : 
• Be prepared to adjust the outlook based on incoming data  while being humble 
about our ability to draw firm conclusions and thus not overreact ing to a few data 
points.  
• Seek out useful data sources, including high-frequency data that may better 
capture evolving economic developments.  
• And f ollow a risk -management approach that considers not only the expected 
outcomes , but also various risks to the  outlook.  
Of course, it is tempting to follow the old adage of “never make predictions, 
especially about the future.”  But ultimately, policymaking must be forward -looking, 
which means relying, at least in part, on forecasts.  The challenge is to figure ou t which 
models apply.   For example, w hen I began studying banks in the post -Soviet era for my 
dissertation, I found that the standard models used in normal times and for mature, 
industrialized economies are less useful in highly uncertain environments.    - 8 - 
Since my first FOMC meeting last June, my data -dependent, risk -management 
approach has led me to support the Fed’s response of frontloading monetary policy 
tightening to bring inflation under control.  
After the swift policy response  of the past year, moneta ry policy is now in 
restrictive territory.  For instance, real interest rates are positive across the yield curve.5 
Going forward, I am weighing the implications of stronger momentum in the 
economy against potential headwinds from recent developments.  On the one hand, i f 
tighter financing conditions restrain the economy, the appropriate path of the federal 
funds rate may be lower than it would be in their absence.   On the other hand, i f data 
show continued strength in the economy and slower disinflation, we may have more work 
to do.  
The FOMC has been  raising rates in smaller increments as we seek a sufficiently 
restrictive monetary policy stance to return inflation to 2 percent over tim e.  By taking 
smaller steps, we can observe economic and financial conditions and consider the cumulative effects of our policy  actions .  
For the econometricians, this approach is similar to the iterative procedure in 
maximum likelihood estimation, where large early steps are followed by smaller steps as 
you approach the local optimum.  
In its March policy statement, the FOMC dialed back its forward guidance on the 
path of the policy rate.
6  We shifted from anticipating  “ongoing increases ” to saying that

infla tion swa p markets, a s well a s  survey expectations.

Statement,” press release, March 22, 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20230322a.htm .  - 9 - 
“some additional policy firming may be appropriate.”  I think this communication is 
appropriate as we seek to calibrate monetary policy to be sufficiently restrictive amid 
uncertainty about the economic outlook.  
Yet w hat should not be unce rtain is our commitment to our dual -mandate goals of 
maximum employment and price stability.  We will do what it takes to bring inflation 
back to our 2 percent target over time, which will lay the foundation for sustainable 
strength in the labor market and the U .S. economy.

Thank you very much for inviting me to discuss this paper.  It is a timely review 
for central bankers charged with lowering inflation to targets or, in the terminology of the 
authors, managing disinflation.  I really enjoyed reading it.  Before I begin, le t me remind 
you that the views I will express today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.  
My discussion time is limited .  Therefore, I’ll be selective.  I will begin by briefly 
describing what the paper is about.  Then, I will summarize the authors’ takeaways from their analysis.  Next, I will share my takeaways.  Finally, I will offer some concluding remarks.  
So what is this paper about? Conceptually, the paper can be divided into three 
parts.  In the first part, the authors review historical disinflationary episodes in the U nited 
States and other countries to  see what lessons we might learn from past experience.  
In the second part, the authors present a simple, tractable model  that relates 
interest rates , inflation, inflation expectations, and slack in the labor market.  They use 
the model to make predictions about future inflation. 
In the third part, the authors provide a dvice to monetary policymakers on how to 
address the current situation ; that is, how to manage disinflation.  
With that, let me cut to consideration of the authors’ takeaways.   The authors’ first takeaway, based on past disinflation episodes in the United 
States and abroad, is that policymakers should expect that disinflation will be  costly  in 
terms of foregone output or employment.  They find that all 16 of the large policy -
induced disinflations in the four advanced economies they study were associated with a  - 2 - 
recession .1 As the paper makes clear, however, a good measure of judgment comes into 
the exercise of identifying and quantifying disinflationary episodes.  History is replete 
with confounding factors that make parsing difficult.  These factors include supply shocks, labor market structure, economi c conditions at the start of the disinflationary 
episode, how “well anchored” are inflation expectations, and the speed at which a disinflation is carried out.  Even so, the authors are thorough in what they do.  And while one may quibble with bits and pie ces, their argument that policymakers should accept 
that disinflation is likely to be costly is well reasoned.  
The authors’ second takeaway from history is that state dependencies or 
nonlinear ities are also in play.  The state dependency they note is that a higher initial 
inflation rate is associated with a lower sacrifice ratio .  To explain this finding, they 
advance an argument based on policy credibility.  Specifically, they argue that a high initial inflation rate enhances the plausibility of central banks’ willingness to incur the 
cost of reducing inflation.  That strikes me as plausible on its face, but there are other 
stories that may also apply.  In the interest of brevity, let me point out just one.  Central bankers are constantly warning of combat ting inflationary shocks before those forces 
become embedded in inflation expectations.
2 The Volcker disinflation of 1981–82 
 
1 They draw this conclusion by replicating some of the methodology from the literature on sacrifice ratios.  
See, for example, Ball (1994) and Tetlow (2022) and references therein.  
2 For example, Chair Powell, in testimony before the U.S. Senate, said, “ We will use our tools to support 
the economy and a strong labor market and to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched” (Powell, 
2022a).  This reasoning has a lengthy history, as evidenced by  remarks in 2008 by then Vice  Chair of the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  Donald Kohn:  “ As demonstrated by historical 
experiences around the world and in the United States during the 1970s and 1980s, efforts to bring inflation 
and inflation expectations back to desirable levels after they have risen appreciably involve costly and 
undesirable changes in resource utilization” (Kohn, 2008).  And the sentiment is shared internationally, as 
remarks by Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem attest:   “If we don’t do enough [policy tightening], 
Canadians will continue to endure the hardship of high inflation.  And they will come to expect persistently 
high inflation, which will require much higher interest rates and, potentially, a severe recession to control 
inflation.  Nobody wants that” (Macklem, 2022).   - 3 - 
resulted in a painful recession.  But the reduction in inflation was large.  Thus, measured 
in terms of percentage points of infla tion reduction, as is conventionally done, it was not 
particularly costly.3  A plausible, if partial, explanation for this finding is that the Volcker 
disinflation was carried out before  the inflation associated with the second OPEC oil 
price shock had be come entrenched in inflation expectations and more generally at a time 
when inflation expectations were fluid.4  This is relevant as my colleagues on the FOMC 
and I strive to bring down actual inflation promptly in order to preserve the “well 
anchored” longer -term inflation expectations we see in the data.  It is also consistent with 
the authors’ argument that swift and relatively painless disinflations of the past were due 
to early and sharp policy interest rate increases.   
The authors’ third takeaway fr om history is  that easing monetary policy before the 
disinflation is complete, or easing by too much, is costly.5  My reading of this claim is 
that while central bankers might entertain hopes that they will directly see a dividend 
from early, forceful pol icy actions, historical experience suggests that they should not 
count on such a favorable outcome.  
And, finally, they argue that policy needs to look ahead and act preemptively.  
While the authors do not present evidence to support this claim, it is an ar gument with 
which policymakers nearly always agree, in principle, but find difficult to execute, in 
practice.  As I’ll discuss in a minute, choosing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, 
 
3 Converting the unemployment sacrifice ratio in Ball (1994) into output space using an Okun coefficient of 
two renders an output sacrifice ratio of just 1.8, a small number by histori cal standards.  For a summary of 
sacrifice ratios in history, see Tetlow (2022) and Cecchetti and others (2023).  
4 This may be related to the authors’ second conjecture on why initially high levels of inflation are 
associated with lower sacrifice ratios —namely, that high inflation is associated with large global supply 
shocks (Cecchetti and others, 2023, p. 18).  It is analytically distinct, however, in that they do not 
emphasize the timely monetary policy response to those shocks.  
5 This point is elaborate d upon in Chair Powell’s 2022 Jackson Hole speech; see Powell (2022b).   - 4 - 
in real time, to influence expected future economic conditions i s a difficult task in the 
best of circumstances.  It is all that much more difficult when the economy is 
experiencing a once -in-a-century disturbance of worldwide significance.  
As you have already heard, the authors outline a very simple model that relate s 
interest rates, slack in the economy, inflation, and inflation expectations.  They use this model to forecast inflation in the year 2021 and evaluate the model’s predictive performance, employing alternative measures of slack, linear and nonlinear relati onships, 
and different sample periods.  Interestingly, the various measures of slack, and specifications for slack, make little difference.   The models do a little better when you 
allow them to see data from the era of high and volatile inflation in the 1960s and ’70s instead of restricting consideration to the Great Moderation period, as empirical tests for structural breaks would surely have suggested.
6  Two  key and related reason s for this 
improvement are  that inflation expectations in the 1960s and 1970s were  more persistent 
and that the slope of the empirical Phillips curve was steeper than during recent history.  
The authors’ policy takeaways fall into two classes.  First, there are the 
conclusions that pertain to the current situation.  They suggest that t he unusually large 
and rapid tightening in policy in 2022 was good policy.  In particular, the authors 
contend, on page 19, that “ the apparent anchoring of long- term [inflation] expectations 
may reflect in part the FOMC’s unanticipated shift toward aggressive rate hikes.”  In 
addition, despite the rapid tightening to date, the authors contend that additional monetary 
 
6 The borderline, as it were, between the inflationary era that the authors argue is critical for obtaining 
plausible results in their conditional forecasting exercise and the Great Moderation period is the Volcker 
disinflation of 1981 –82.  Sims and Zha (2006) argue that the Volcker disinflation is the only regime shift 
that can be unequivocally shown to be present in the data over the postwar period in their sample.   - 5 - 
policy tightening is likely to prove necessary to achieve 2 percent inflation by 2025 and is 
likely to lead to a mild recession.  
Second, there are the more general takeaways.  The authors favor aggressive 
monetary policy tightening—or preemption —over gradualism.  And they argue that the 
costs of increasing the target rate of inflation outweigh the benefits  because t he loss of 
credibility from showing a lack of resolve to achieve 2 percent inflation will persist.  
Now, let me share my takeaways.  First, figure 4.1 in the paper demonstrates that, 
standing at the end of 2020, it would have been difficult to forecast the increase in inflation we observed in 2021 and 2022:  The out -of-sample forecasts are far below the 
actual.  This result stands despite the authors having benefited from knowledge of how economic forces played out that would not have been available in real time.  Here, I emphasize the unprecedented nature of the pandemic, with its wide -reaching economic 
effects and comingling of economic and public health policies.  It’s just very difficult to 
formulate forecasts and implement preemptive monetary policy in real time, espec ially 
under such extraordinary circumstances.  
A corollary, of sorts, of this observation is that the idiosyncratic nature of the 
pandemic implies that economic models, while still useful in many respects, are going to have limited applicability.  Taken at face value, the model assumes, as all models do, that 
the past tells policymakers what they need to know.  But current inflation dynamics are being driven by some pandemic -specific factors not seen in the historical data.  It follows 
that policymakers need  to look at a broader range of  factors to understand recent inflation 
dynamics .   - 6 - 
Let me illustrate this point by considering three large categories that make up  core  
personal consumption expenditures inflation.  These are  core goods inflation, housing 
services inflation , and inflation in core services excluding housing.  I t’s useful to  look at 
these three categories separately because the driving forces behind each diffe r.  Some of 
these forces are pandemic specific, and u nderstanding the different causes s hould help us 
predict what will happen to inflation going forward.  
 Focusing on the price of core goods, the black line in the chart, you can see how 
goods prices started climbing in the second half of 2020 and rose sharply in 2021 as the 
pandemic -driven disruptions to social interactions induced a rapid shift in demand from 
services to goods, exacerbating snags in global supply chain s.  By the end of 2021, once 
vaccines were developed and deployed and people slowly emerged from isolation, the shift in dem and back to services began, and supply chain bottlenecks started to ease.  
Thus, inflation in this category came down substantially over the course of 2022.  The 
strengthening of the overall economy may have played a role in core goods price inflation, but  it was likely secondary to the roles played by goods -specific demand and by 
the production and distribution network for goods over this period.  In contrast, housing services inflation , the blue line in the chart, picked up appreciably in 2022 after havin g 
softened early in the pandemic.  Inflation in this sector is also driven by certain pandemic -specific factors.  In particular, t he surge in work from home led to an abrupt 
increase in the demand for bigger homes located in smaller metro areas or further from city centers .  House prices and rents increased significantly .  We have not seen a decline 
in housing services inflation  yet, but recent data on new leases and lease renewals 
indicate  that we soon will .  Lastly, we have inflation in other core service s, the red line in  - 7 - 
the graph, a large category that covers activities as varied as travel and recreation, and 
medical and legal services.  Inflation for these services , most of which are labor 
intensive, has remained stubbornly high.  An  important source o f inflation pressures in 
this category has likely been the shortage of workers, which has pushed up labor costs at rates above those consistent with 2 percent inflation .  The inflation outlook for this 
nonhousing category of core services will likely depend in large part on whether labor 
demand moves into better balance with labor supply and growth  in nominal labor costs .  
Recent data suggest that labor  compensation has indeed started to decelerate somewhat 
over the past year  but is still running too high t o be consistent with returning inflation to 
2 percent in a timely and sustainable fashion.  The point is that the inflationary forces impinging on the U.S. economy at present represent a complex mixture of temporary and more long- lasting elements that defy  simple, parsimonious explanation.  
The ongoing imbalance between the supply and demand for  labor , combined with 
the large share of labor costs in the services sector, suggests that high inflation may come down only slowly.  The paper notes the role of cent ral bank credibility in managing 
disinflations, but I do not attribute the persistence in inflation to  a lack of Fed credibility .  
Indeed, there is evidence in support of central bank credibility, including that long- term 
inflation expectations are not far from the FOMC’s 2 percent target.  
Let me conclude with a summary of my takeaways.  History is useful, but it can only tell us so much, particularly in situations without 
historical precedent .   
The current situation is different from past episodes in at least four  ways .  First, 
the pandemic created unprecedented disruptions to global supply chains.  Second, the  - 8 - 
pandemic is having a long- lasting effect on labor force participation rates.  Third, t he 
credibility of the central bank is higher now than it was in the 1960s and 1970s.  Fourth 
and most importantly, unlike in the late 1960s and 1970s, the Federal Reserve is addressing the outbreak in inflation promptly and forcefully to maintain that credibility and to preserve the “well anchored” property of long- term inflation expectations.  
Finally, e conomic models are important tools but  need to be used with careful 
interpretation and judgment when history does not speak to the current situation.  Sound decisionmaking requires that their findings be comple mented with additional  analytical 
tools , including careful scrutiny of real -time data.  
Thank you!

Inaugural Janet L. Yellen Award for Excellence in Community Development 
 
Washington, D.C. 
 
 
 
 
 
December 3, 2018Thank you, Anna.  It’s an honor to be part of this important occasion.  Tonight is an 
opportunity to recognize the vital contributions of the Federal Reserve’s communi ty 
development staff, and an opportunity to honor Chair Yellen, who did so much to advance the 
Fed’s community development mission.  
Briefly, I would like to focus on the importance of promoting a strong economy that 
extends opportunity to all and on the r ole our community development staff plays  to advance that 
goal.  
The Federal Reserve ’s mission is to promote a strong economy and sound financial 
system ; I am glad to say we have made a great deal of progress toward those goals.   
Unemployment is 3.7 percent , the lowest in nearly half a century.  Over 17 million jobs have 
been created during this expansion, with an additional 250,000 created in October.  
Beyond the labor market, there are other signs of economic strength.  The steady decline 
in the unemployment rate is mirrored by the decline in financial hardship reported by 
respondents to the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Household Economics and Decisionma king over 
the past five years.1  Wage gains, increased household wealth, and elevated consumer confidence 
are supporting robust consumer spending.  Since the crisis, we have also taken numerous steps to 
make the financial system safer and stronger, leaving  it better equipped to support the financial 
needs of consumers and communities through good times and bad.2

However, the benefits of this strong economy and sound financial system have not 
reached all Americans.  The aggregate statistics tend to mask impo rtant disparities by income, 
race, and geography.  
Moreover , the economy faces a number of longer -term challenges.3  While there have 
been gains in the pace of wage growth recently, wages for lower -income workers have grown 
quite slowly over the past few decades.  Productivity has picked up in recent months after several 
years of very slow growth, but it is not clear whether this is a trend that will be sustained.  An 
aging population is limiting growth in labor supply, which in turn limits potential growth.   And a 
decades -long decline in economic mobility in the United States reflects the difficulty faced by  
lower -income Americans in moving  up the economic ladder.4  
The Fed’s community development function plays a key role in helping us carry out our 
broad responsibilities.  Information gathered by the community development staff ensures that 
the perspectives of individuals and communities inform the Fed’s research, p olicy, and actions.  
Soliciting diverse views on issues affecting the economy and financial markets improves the 
quality of our research, the fairness of our policies, and the transparency of our actions.  Raising 
awareness of emerging economic trends and risks makes regulation and supervision more 
responsive to evolving consumer financial services markets and technologies.  T he Fed’s 
community development function also advances our Community Reinvestment Act

successful approaches for attracting and deploying capital.  These efforts strengthen the capacity 
of both financial institutions and community organizations to meet the needs of the communities 
they serve.

economic and financial conditions, the Federal Reserve’s community development staff is deeply 
engaged in helping lower -income and underserved communities overcome their chall enges and 
capitalize on their assets.  One thing that was apparent during the recession and the uneven 
recovery that followed was that people and the places they live are linked.  W hen one struggles, 
both struggle.  Successful community development invests  in and builds up both the physical 
infrastructure and human capital in underserved areas.  The Federal Reserve is uniquely 
positioned to bring together diverse stakeholders to disseminate information, exchange ideas, and 
identify shared interests that fos ter local partnerships and comprehensive solutions.  
This event is an opportunity to recognize your efforts to advance solutions that build 
resilient and more prosperous communities.  I want to thank Ariel Cisneros --our distinguished 
inaugural recipient of the Yellen Award for Excellence in Community Development --as well as 
each of you for your individual and collective service to this effort.  
And speaking of service:  It is fitting that this award for excellence in community 
development will today and thenc eforth be given in honor of Janet Yellen.  During your tenure 
as Chair, Janet, you elevated the importance of economic and financial inclusion and the Fed’s 
role in community development.  You reminded us that an inclusive economy is a vibrant 
economy.  Governor Brainard, the principal oversight governor for community development, and - 4 - 
 
I are honored to carry  this message  forward.  The economy benefits when we successfully tap 
into the underutilized potential of more of our fellow Americans.5  
Thank you, Janet, for everything that you accomplished as Chair and over a lifetime of 
public service that thankfully continues today.  And congratulations, Ariel, for what you have 
accomplished in service to others, which has made you such a deserving recipient of this award.

The Evolving Structure of the U.S. Treasury Market: Second Annual  Conference  
 
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York  
 
New York, N.Y.  
 
October 24, 2016  
  1 
   This panel will focus on the settlement infrastructure for U.S. government securities  -- a 
vital component of the Treasury market  and one that  is undergoing  an important transition .  This 
segment of the industry has been in a period of slow but steady consolidation for several decades 
now.  Thirty years ago, there were six banks providing a full suite of settlement services for U.S. government securities.  Due to  mergers and exits, two firms , Bank of New York Mellon 
(BNYM)  and J.P. Morgan Chase (JPMC) , have been the two dominant providers of  these 
services  since the 1990s .  And soon there will be just one, given JPMC’s planned exit. 
  Given the importance of these  services, t he official sector has had a long involvement as 
the market structure has evolved.  After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the Federal 
Reserve c onvened the private- sector Working Group on Government Securities Clearance and 
Settleme nt to recommend steps to mitigate risks to the financial system from a disruption to 
these services.  That work led to the  “NewBank” proposal .
1  Although the proposal was 
ultimately put aside , NewBank would have been a dormant financial institution that could spring 
into action in the event  of potential disruptions from an exit from this business by either of the 
clearing banks.  Some of today’s panelists were actively involved in that  work.  Of course, at that 
time, the business was roughly evenly split between the two providers.   Today’s situation is very 
different – BNYM now has over 80 percent  market share,  due mainly to consolidation among 
end users.    
 The Federal Reserve has been working closely with the Department of the Treasury to 
ensure a smooth transition as JPMC prepares to exit .   JPMC  has said that it recognizes the need

 for, and its own interest in, ensuring that its  exit does not disrupt the market.  Indeed, JPMC  will 
itself need to rely on these services going forward .  The timeline set for a gradual transition over 
the next two years should be sufficient to avoid significant dislocations ; however , if unexpected 
complications arise , that timeline may need to be adjusted.  
  In the near term, this exit will leave BNYM as the sole provider of U.S. government 
securities settlement and triparty repo  services  for broker- dealers .  We have been  working 
intensively with BNYM in anticipation of this  transition.  W e have long  recognized that any 
disruptions to the se critical market s ervices could have serious consequences  for financial 
stability , and have calibrated our supe rvisory expectations accordingly.  To ensure  financial 
stability, we expect the provision of U.S. government securities settlement services to be robust 
in nearly all cont ingencies . 
  As BNYM becomes the sole provider, w e will raise our expectations  even higher.  The 
bank has anticipated and welcomed this higher bar.  BNYM is one of 8 U.S.- based systemically 
important banks .  The bank is therefore subject to heightened capital and liquidity requirements  
and a resolution process that explicitly requires planning to ensure the continuity of critical services even in the event of a default.   
   BNYM is unique in that it also plays the dominant – and soon the sole – role in 
government securities settlement and in the triparty repo market.  These activities  are comparable 
in their importance to  those  of the financial market utilities that have been designated as 
systemicall y important by the FSOC.  Thus, BNYM will continue to be held to the high 
standards to which all U.S. bank SIFIs are held.  And it will also be expected to operate in a 
manner that provides confidence that it is as resilient and robust as a systemically important 
financial market utility  (FMU) .  Such FMUs are, of course, held to the P rinciples for Financial 3 
 Market Infrastructures  (PFMIs).2   The PFMIs overlap with our banking regulation in many 
areas; for example, both emphasize the need for sound risk management and the importance of 
resilience and recovery.  The PFMIs also emphasize a strong governance role in support of 
financial stability and the interests of market functioning, and this has been a focus of our  work 
with Bank of New York Mellon regarding  the transition.         
  Although our current task is to establish appropriate  expectations for Bank of New York 
Mellon  as a sole oper ator, that focus should not be taken as an indication that the Federal 
Reserve or other public authorities have pre -judged what the longer -term landscape for 
government securities settlement should look like.  In fact, we do not have a specific market 
design end state in mind.  Rather, we recognize the systemic importance of these activities and the need to ensure their continued availability in nearly all states of the world, regardless of the 
firms that offer them or the  specific market structure.   
  The industry as a whole should play an important role in shaping  the evolution of the 
settlement infrastructure.  Other firms may seek to enter this market. The re have also been 
discussions over time of  a settlement utility, and the D epository T rust & Clearing C orporation is 
currently considering a new variant of such a model.  Our focus is on the quality  of the services 
offered -- their safety , resilience, and support of the market --  and not on the particular 
mechan ism for offering them.  If new proposals come forward that are consistent with our goals 
of a safe and resilient settlement system, then the y will receive fair consideration.

The 2014 Michel Camdessus Central Banking Lecture  
International Monetary Fund 
 
Washington, D.C. 
  
 
 
   
July 2, 2014  
  
It is an honor to deliver the inaugural Michel Camdessus Central Banking 
Lecture.  Michel Camdessus served with distinct ion as g overnor  of the Banque de France 
and was one of  the longest -serving m anaging directors  of the  International Monetary 
Fund ( IMF).  In these roles, he was well aware of the challenges central banks face in 
their pursuit of price stability and full employment, and of the interconnections between 
macroeconomic stability and financial stability.  Those interconnections were apparent in 
the Latin American debt crisis, the Mexican peso crisis, and the East Asian financial crisis , to which the IMF responded under Camdessus’ s leadership .  These episodes took 
place in emerging market economies,  but since then, the global financial crisis and , more 
recently , the euro crisis have reminded us that no economy is immune from  financial 
instability and the adverse effects  on employment, economic activity, and price stability 
that financial crises cause.   
The r ecent  crises have appropriately increased the focus on financial stability at 
central banks around the world.  At the Federal Reserve, we have devoted substan tially 
increased resources to monitoring financial stability and have refocused our regulatory and supervisory efforts to limit the buildup of systemic risk.  There have also been calls, 
from some quarters, for a fundamental reconsideration of the goals and strategy  of 
monetary policy.  Today I will focus on a key  question spurred by this debate:   How 
should monetary and other policymakers balance macroprudential approaches and 
monetary policy in the pursuit of financial stability ? 
In my remarks, I will arg ue that monetary policy faces significant limitations as a 
tool to promote financial stability:  Its effects on financial vulnerabilities, such as 
excessive leverage and maturity transformation, are not well understood and are less  - 2 - 
direct than a regulatory  or supervisory approach; in addition, efforts to promote financial 
stability through adjustments in interest rates would increase the volatility of inflation and 
employment.  As a result, I believe a macroprudential approach to supervision and 
regulation needs to play the primary role.  Such an approach should focus on “through the cycle” standards that increase the resilience of the financial system to adverse shocks and on efforts to ensure that the regulatory umbrella will cover previously uncovered systemically important institutions and activities.   These efforts should be complemented 
by the use of  countercyclical macroprudential tools, a few of which I will describe.  But 
experience with such tools remains limited , and we have much to learn to use th ese 
measures  effectively.  
I am also mindful of the potential for low interest rates to  heighten the incentives  
of financial market participants to reach for yield and take on risk, and of the limits of  
macroprudential measures  to address these and other financial stability concerns .  
Accordingly, there may be times when an adjustment in monetary policy may be appropriate to ameliorate emerging risks to financial stability.  Because of this possibility, and because transparency enhances the effectiveness of monetary policy, it is crucial that policymakers communicate their views clearly on the risks to financial stability and how 
such risks influence the appropriate monetary policy  stance.  I will conclude by briefly 
laying out h ow financial stability concerns affect my current assessment of the 
appropriate stance of monetary policy.  
Balancing F inancial Stability with Price Stability:   Lessons from the Recent Past  
When considering the connections  between financial stability, price  stability, and 
full employment, the discussion often focus es on the potential for conflict s among these 
  - 3 - 
objectives.  Such situations are important, since it is only when conflicts arise that 
policymakers need to weigh the tradeoffs among multiple objectiv es.  But it is important 
to note that, in many ways, the pursuit of financial stability is complementary to the goals 
of price stability and full employment.  A  smoothly operating financial system promotes 
the efficient allocation of saving and investment, facilitating economic growth and employment.  A strong labor market contributes to healthy household and business balance sheets, thereby contributing to financial stability.  And price stability contributes not only to the efficient allocation of resourc es in the real economy , but also to reduced 
uncertainty and efficient pricing in financial markets, which  in turn support s financial 
stability.  
Despite these complementarities,  monetary policy has powerful effects on  risk 
taking .  Indeed, the accommodative policy stance of recent years has supported the 
recovery, in part, by providing increased incentives for households and businesses to take 
on the risk of potentially productive investments .  But such risk- taking can go too far, 
thereby contributing to fragility in the financial system.
1  This possibility does not 
obviate the need for monetary policy to focus primarily on price stability and full 
employment-- the costs to society in terms of  deviations from price stability and full 
employment that would a rise would likely be significant .  I will highlight these potential 
costs and the clear need for a macroprudential policy approach by looking  back at the 
vulnerabilities in the U.S. economy before the crisis .  I will also discuss  how the se 
1 The possibility that periods of relative economic stability may contribute to risk -taking and the buildup of 
imbalances that may unwind in a painful manner is often linked to the ideas of Hyman Minsky ( see 
Hyman  P. Minsky (1992), “ The F inancial Instability Hypothesis ,” Working Paper 74 (Annandale -on-
Hudson, N.Y.:  Jerome Levy Economics Institute of Bard College, May) , 
www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/wp74.pdf).    For a recent example of an economic model that tries to explore 
these ideas, see, for example, Markus K. Brunnermeier and Yuliy Sannikov ( 2014 ), “A Macroeconomic 
Model with a Financial Sector ,” American Economic Review,  vol. 104 (February), pp. 379- 421. 
                                                   - 4 - 
vulnerabilities might have been affected had the Federal Reserve tightened monetary 
policy in the mid -2000s to promote financial stability.   
Looking B ack at the M id-2000s  
Although it was not  recognized at the time, r isks to financial stability  within the 
United States  escalated  to a dangerous  level  in the mid -2000s.  D uring that period, 
policymakers --myself included --were aware that homes seemed overvalued by a number 
of sensible metrics  and that home  prices might decline , although there was disagreement 
about how likel y such a decline was and how large it might be .  What was not 
appreciated was how serious the fallout from such a decline would be for the financial sector and the macroeconomy .  Policymakers failed to anticipate  that the reversal of the 
house  price bubble  would trigger the most significant financial crisis in the United States 
since the Great Depression because that reversal  interacted with critical vulnerabilities in 
the financial system and in government regulation.   
In the private sector, key vulnerabi lities included high levels of leverage, 
excessive dependence on unstable short -term funding, weak underwriting of loans, 
deficiencies in risk measurement and risk management, and the use of exotic financial instruments that redistributed risk in nontransparent ways.   
In the public sector, vulnerabilities included gaps in the regulatory structure that 
allowed some systemically important financial institutions  (SIFIs) and markets to escape 
comprehensive supervision, failures of supervisors to effectively use their existing powers, and insufficient attention to threats to the stability of the system as a whole.  
It is not uncommon to hear it suggested that the crisis could have been prevented 
or significantly mitigated by substantially tighter monetary polic y in the mid -2000s .  At 
  - 5 - 
the very least, however, such an approach would have been insufficient to address the full 
range of critical vulnerabilities  I have just described.  A tighter monetary policy would 
not have closed the gaps in the regulatory structur e that allowed some SIFIs and markets 
to escape comprehensive supervision;  a tighter monetary polic y would not have shifted 
supervisory attention to a macroprudential perspective ; and a tighter monetary policy 
would not have increased the transparency of e xotic financial instruments or ameliorated 
deficiencies in risk measurement and risk management within the private sector.  
Some advocates of the view that a substantially tighter monetary policy may have 
helped prevent the crisis might acknowledge these points,  but they might also argue that a 
tighter monetary policy could have limited the rise in house prices , the use of leverage 
within the private sector, and the excessive reliance on short -term funding, and that each 
of these channels would have conta ined--or perhaps even prevented --the worst effects  of 
the crisis.  
A review of the empirical evidence suggests that the level of interest rates does 
influence house prices, leverage , and maturity transformation , but it is also  clear that a 
tighter monetary policy would have been a very blunt tool :  Substantially mitigating  the 
emerging financial vulnerabilities  through higher interest rates would have had sizable 
adverse effects in terms of higher unemploym ent.  In particular, a range of studies 
conclude  that tighter monetary policy during the mid -2000s m ight have contributed to a 
slower rate of house price appreciation.  But the magnitude of this effect would likely 
have been  modest relative to the substantial momentum in these  prices over the period;  
hence, a very significant  tightening, with large increases in un employment, would have 
  - 6 - 
been necessary to halt  the housing bubble.2  Such a slowing in the housing market m ight 
have constrained the rise in household leverage, as mort gage debt growth would have 
been slower .  But the job losses  and higher interest payments associated with higher 
interest rates would have directly weakened households’  ability to repay previous debts, 
suggesting that a sizable tightening may have mitigated vulnerabilities  in household 
balance sheets only modestly .3 
Similar mixed results would have been likely with regard to the effects of tighter 
monetary policy on leverage and reliance on short -term financing within the financial 
sector.  In parti cular, the evidence that low interest rates contribute to increased leverage 
and reliance on short -term funding  points toward some ability of higher interest rates to 
lessen these vulnerabilities, but that evidence is typically consistent with  a sizable range 
2 For a discussion of this issue encompassing experience across a broad range of advanced economies in the 
2000s, including the United States, see Jane Dokko , Brian M. Doyle , Michael T. Kiley , Jinill Kim , Shane 
Sherlund , Jae Sim , and  Skander Van Den Heuvel  (2011), “ Monetary Policy  and the Global Housing 
Bubble,”  Economic Policy , vol. 26  (April), pp.  233-83.  Igan and Loungani (2012) highlight how interest 
rates are an important, but far from the most important, determinant of housing cycles across countries  (see 
Deniz Igan and Prakash Loungani (2012), “Global Housing Cycles,” IMF Working Paper Series 
WP/12/217 (Washington:  International Monetary Fund, August), 
www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=26229.0).  Bean and others (2010) , examining the 
tradeoffs between unemployment, inflation, and stabilization of the housing market in the United Kingdom , 
imply  that reliance on monetary policy to contain a housing boom may be too costly in terms of other 
monetary policy goals  (see Charles Bean, Matthias Paustian, Adrian Penalver, and Tim Taylor (2010), 
“Monetary Policy after the Fall,” paper presented at “Macroeconomic Challenges:  The Decade Ahead,” a 
symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson Hole, Wyo., 
August  26-28, www.kansascityfed.org/publicat/sympos/2010/2010- 08-23-bean.pdf).   Saiz (2014) suggests 
that about 50 percent of the variation in house prices during the 2000s boom can be explained by low 
interest rates, and finds that it was the remaining, “non -fundamenta l” component that subsequently 
collapsed --that is, the interest rate component was not a primary factor in what Saiz terms “the bust ” (see 
Albert Saiz (2014), “Interest Rates and Fundamental Fluctuations in Home Values,” paper presented at the Public Polic y and Economics Spring 2014 Workshops, hosted by the Harris School of Public Policy, 
University of Chicago, April 8, 
http://harrisschool.uchicago.edu/sites/default/files/SAIZ%20FUNDAMENTALS1_0.pdf ). 
3 The notion that tighter monetary policy may have ambiguous effects on leverage or repayment capacity is 
illustrated in, for example, Anton Korinek and Alp Simsek (2014 ), “Liquid ity Trap and Excessive 
Leverage,” NBER Working Paper Series 19970 (Cambridge, Mass.:  National Bureau of Economic 
Research, March) . 
                                                   - 7 - 
of quantitative effects  or alternative views regarding the causal channels at work .4  
Furthermore , vulnerabilities  from excessive leverage and reliance on shor t-term funding  
in the financial sector grew  rapidly through the middle of 2007, well after monetary 
policy had already tightened significantly relative to the accommodative policy stance of 
2003 and early 2004.  In my assessment, macroprudential policies , such as regulatory 
limits on leverage and short -term funding , as well as stronger underwritin g standards , 
represent far more direct and likely more effective methods  to address these 
vulnerabilities.5 
Recent International Experience  
Turning to recent experience outside the United States , a number of foreign 
economies have seen  rapidly rising real estate prices , which has rais ed financial stability 
concerns despite, in some cases,  high unemployment and shortfalls in inflation relative to 
the central bank ’s inflation target.6  These developments have prompted debate  on how to 
4 See, for example, Tobias  Adrian  and Hyun Song Shin (2010 ), “Liquidity and Leverage ,” Journal of 
Financial Intermediation, vol.  19 (July), pp.  418-37; and Tobias Adrian and Hyun Song Shin (2011),  
“Financial Intermediaries and Monetary Economics ,” in Benjamin Friedman and Michael Woodford, eds., 
Handbook of Monetary Economics , vol. 3A (San Diego, Ca.:  Elsevier), pp. 601 -50.  For a study 
emphasizing how changes in the response of monetary policy to f inancial vulnerabilities would  likely 
change the relationship between monetary policy and financial vulnerabilities, see Oliver de Groot (2014 ), 
“The Risk Channel of Monetary Policy,”  International Journal of Central Banking,  vol. 10 (June), pp. 115 -
60, www.ijcb.org/journal/ijcb14q2a6.pdf . 
5 This evidence and experience suggest that a reliance on monetary policy as a primary tool to address the 
broad range of vulnerabilities that emerged in the mid -2000s would have had uncertain and limited effects 
on risks  to financial stability.  Such uncertainty  does not imply that a modestly tighter monetary policy may 
not have been marginally helpful.  For example , some research suggests that financial imbalances that 
became apparent in the mid -2000s may have signaled a  tighter labor market and more inflationary pressure 
than would have been perceived solely from labor market conditions and overall economic activity.  Hence, 
such financial imbalances may have called for a modestly tighter monetary policy through the trad itional 
policy lens focused on inflationary pressure and economic slack.   See, for example, David M. Arseneau and 
Michael Kiley (2014), “ The Role of Financial Imbalances in Assessing the State of the Economy ,” FEDS

best balance the use of monetary policy and macroprudential  tools  in promoting financial 
stability . 
For example, Canada, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom have expressed a 
willingness to use monetary policy to address financial stability  concerns in unusual 
circumstances, but they have similarly concluded that macroprudential policies should 
serve as the primary tool to pursue financial stability .  In Canada, w ith inflation below 
target and output growth quite subdued, the Bank of Canada has kept the policy rate at or 
below 1 percent, but  limits on mortgage lending were tightened in each of the years from 
2009 through 2012, including changes in loan- to-value and  debt -to-income caps, among 
other measures .7  In contrast, in Norway and Sweden, monetary policy decisions have 
been in fluenced somewhat by financial stability concerns , but the steps taken have been 
limited .  In Norway, policymakers increased the  policy interest rate in mid -2010 when 
they were facing escalating household debt despite  inflation below target and output 
below capacity, in part as a way of “guarding against the risk of future imbalances.”8  
Similarly, Sweden’s Riksbank held its policy rate “slightly higher than we would have 
done otherwise” because of  financial stability concerns .9  In both cases, macroprudential 
actions were also either taken or under consideration.

In reviewing  these experiences, it seems clear that monetary policymakers have 
perceived significant hurdles to using sizable adjustments in monetary policy  to contain 
financial stability risks .  Some proponents of a larger  monetary policy response to 
financial stability concerns might argue that these perceived hurdles have been 
overblown and that financial stability concerns  should be elevated significantly in 
monetary policy discussions .  A more balanced assessment , in my view, would be that 
increased focus on financial stability risks is appropriate in monetary policy discussions , 
but the  potential  cost, in terms of diminished macroeconomic performance, is likely to  be 
too great  to gi ve financial stability risks a central role  in monetary policy decisions, at 
least most of the time.  
If monetary policy is not to play a central  role in addressing financial stability 
issues, this task must rely on  macroprudential policies.  In this regard, I would note that 
here, too, policymakers abroad have made important strides, and not just those in the 
advanced economies.  E merging market economies have in many ways been leaders in 
applying macroprudential policy tools, employing in recent years a variety of restrictions on real estate lending or other activities that were perceived to create vulnerabilities.
10  
Although it is probably too soon to draw clear conclusions , these experiences will help 
inform our understanding of these policies and their efficacy.  
Promoting Financial Stability through  a Macroprudential Approach  
If macroprudential tools are to play the primary role in the pursuit of financial 
stability , questions  remain  on wh ich macroprudential tools  are likely to be mo st effective,

what the limits of such tools  may be , and when , because of such limits,  it may be  
appropriate  to adjust monetary policy to “ get in the  cracks” that persist i n the 
macroprudential framework.11 
In weighing these questions , I find it helpful to distinguish between tools that 
primarily build through- the-cycle resilience against adverse financial developments and 
those  primarily intended  to lean against financial excesses.12   
Building Resilience  
Tools that build resilience aim to make the financial system better able to 
withstand unexpected adverse developments.  For example, requirements  to hold 
sufficient loss -absorbing capital make financial institutions more resilient in the face of 
unexpected losses .  Such requirements take on a macroprudential dimension when they  
are most stringent for the largest, most systemically important firms, thereby minimizing 
the risk that losses at such firms will reverberate through the financial system.  Resilience against runs can be enhanced both by stronger capital positions and requirements for sufficient liquidity buffers among the most interconnected firms .  An effective resolution 
regime for SIFIs can also enhance resilience by better protecting the financial system 
from c ontagion in the event of a SIFI collapse .  Further, the stability of the financial 
system can be enhanced through measures that address interconnectedness between financial firms , such as margin and central clearing requirements for derivatives 
transaction s.  Finally, a regulatory umbrella wide enough to cover previous gaps in the 
11 These questions have been explored in, for example, International Monetary Fund (2013), The 
Interaction of Monetary and Macroprudential Policies  (Washington:  IMF,  January 29 ), 
www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2013/012913.pdf . 
12 The IMF recently discussed  tools to build resilience and lean against excesses ( and provided a broad 
overview of macroprudential tools and their interaction with other policies, including monetary policy ); see  
International Monetary Fund (2013),  Key Aspects of Macroprudent ial Policy  (Washington:  IMF, June 10),

regulation and supervision of systemically important firms and markets can help prevent 
risks from migrating to areas where they are difficult to detect or address.  
In the United States, considerable progress has been made on each of these fronts .  
Changes in bank capital regulation s, which will include  a surcharge for systemically 
important institutions , have significantly increased requirements for loss -absorbing 
capital at the l argest banking firms.  The Federal Reserve ’s stress tests and  
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review  process  require that large financial 
institutions maintain sufficient capital to weather severe shocks, and that they demonstrate that their internal capital planning processes are effective, while providing perspective on the loss -absorbing capacity across  a large swath of the financial system .  
The Basel III framework also includes liquidity requirements designed to mitigate excessive reliance by glob al banks on short -term wholesale funding.   
Oversight of the U.S. shadow banking system also has been strengthened.  The 
new Financial Stability Oversight Council has design ated some nonbank financial firms 
as systemically important institutions  that are s ubject to consolidated supervision by the 
Federal Reserve.   In addition, measures are being undertaken to address some of the 
potential sources of instability in  short -term wholesale funding markets, including 
reforms to  the triparty repo  market and money market mutual funds --altho ugh progress in 
these areas has , at times, been frustratingly slow .   
Additional measures should be taken to address residual risks in the short -term 
wholesale funding markets.  Some of these measures --such as requiring firms to hold 
larger amounts of capital, stable funding, or highly liquid assets based on use of short -
term wholesale funding-- would likely apply only to the largest, most complex 
  - 12 - 
organizations.  Other measures --such as minimum margin requirements for repurchase 
agreements and other securities financing transactions --could, at least in principle, apply 
on a marketwide basis.  To the extent that minimum margin requirements lead to more 
conservative margin levels during normal and exuberant times, they could help avoid 
potentially destabilizing procyclical margin increases in short -term wholesale funding 
markets  during times of stress.  
Leaning Agai nst the Wind  
At this point, i t should be clear that I think efforts to build resilience  in the 
financial system  are critical to minimizing the chance of financial instability  and the 
potential damage from it.  This focus on resilience differs from  much of the public 
discussion, which often concerns whether some particular asset class is experiencing a “bubble ” and whether policymakers should attempt to pop the bubble.  Because a 
resilient financial system can withstand unexpected developments, identification of 
bubble s is less critical .  
Nonetheless, some macroprudential tools can be adjusted in a manner that may 
further enhance resilience as risks emerge.  I n addition, macroprudential tools can, in 
some cases, be targeted at areas of concern .  For example, the new Basel III regulatory 
capital framework includes a countercyclical capital buffer, which may help build additional loss -absorbing capacity  within the financial sector during periods of rapid 
credit creation while also leaning against  emerging excesses.  The stress tests include a 
scenario design process in which the macroeconomic stresses in the scenario become more severe during buoyant economic expansions and incorporate the possibility of highlighting salient risk scenarios, both of which may contribute to increasing resilience 
  - 13 - 
during periods in which risks are rising.13  Similarly, minimum margin requirements for 
securities financing transactions could potentially vary on a countercyclical basis so that 
they are higher in normal tim es than in times of stress.    
Implications for Monetary Policy, Now and in the Future  
In light of the  considerable efforts under way to implement a macroprudential 
approach to enhance financial stability and the increased focus of policymakers on 
monitorin g emerging financial stability risks , I see three key princip les that should guide 
the intera ction of monetary policy and macroprudential policy in the United States.  
First, it is critical for regulators to complete their efforts at implementing a 
macroprudential approach to  enhance resilience within the financial system , which will 
minimize the likelihood that monetary policy will need to focus on financial stability 
issues rather than on price stability and full employment .  Key steps along this  path 
include completion of the transition to full implementation of Basel III, including new 
liquidity requirements; enhanced prudential standards for systemically important firms, including risk -based capital requirements,  a leverage ratio , and tighter prudent ial buffers 
for firms heavily reliant on shor t-term wholesale funding; expansion of the regulatory 
umbrella to incorporate all systemically important firms; the institution of an effective, cross -border resolution regime for systemically important fi nancial institutions; and 
consideration of regulations, such as minimum margin requirements for securities financing transactions , to limit leverage in sectors beyond the banking sector and  SIFIs .

                                                   - 14 - 
Second, policymakers must carefully monitor evolving risks to the financial 
system  and be realistic about the ability of macroprudential tools to influence these 
developments.  The limitations of macroprudential policies reflect the potential for risks 
to emerge outside sectors subject to  regulation, the potential  for supervision and 
regulation to miss emerging  risks, the uncertain efficacy of new macroprudential tools 
such as a countercyclical capital buffer , and the potential for such policy steps  to be 
delayed or to lack public support.14  Given such limitations , adjustments in monetary 
polic y may, at times, be need ed to curb  risks to financial stability.15 
These first two principles will be more effective in helping to address financial 
stability  risks when the public understands how monetary policymakers are wei ghing 
such risks in the setting of monetary policy.  Because these issues are both new and 
complex, there is no simple rule that can prescribe , even in a general sense,  how 
monetary policy should adjust in response to shifts in the outlook for financial st ability.  
As a result, policymakers should clearly and consistently communicate their views on the stability of the financial system and how those views are influencing the stance of monetary policy.  
To that end, I will briefly lay out  my current assessment of f inancial stability risks 
and their relevance, at this time, to the stance of monetary policy  in the United States.  In 
recent years, accommodative monetary policy has contributed to low  interest rates, a flat 
14 For a related discussion , see Elliott, Feldberg, and Lehnert,  “The History of Cyclical Macroprudential 
Policy in the United States .” 
15 Adam and Woodford (2013) present a model in which macroprudential policies are not present and 
housing prices experience swings for reasons not driven by “fundamentals .”  In this context, adjustments in 
monetary policy in response to house price booms --even if such adjustments lead to undesirable inflation or 
employment outcomes --are a component of optimal monetary policy.   See Klaus Adam and Michael 
Woodford (2013), “Housing Prices and Robustly Optimal Monetary Policy,” working paper, June 29,

yield curve, improved financial conditions more broadly, and a stronger labor market .  
These effects have contribut ed to balance sheet repair among households, improved 
financial conditions among businesses, and hence a strengthening in the health of the 
financial sector.   Moreover, the improvement s in household and business balance sheets 
have been accompanied by the increased safety of the financial sector associated with the macroprudential efforts I have outlined.  Overall , nonfinancial credit growth remains 
moderate, while leverage in the financial system , on balance, is much reduced.  Reliance 
on short -term wholesale funding is also significantly lower than  immediately before the 
crisis,  although important structural vulnerabilities remain in short -term funding  market s.   
Taking all of these factors into consideration, I do not presently see a need for 
monetary policy to deviate from a primary focus on attaining price stability and maximum employment, in order  to address financial stability concerns.  That said, I do 
see pockets of increased risk-taking across the financial system, and an acceleration or 
broadening of these concerns could necessitate a more robust macroprudential approach.  For example, corporate bond spreads, as well as indicators of expected volatilit y in some 
asset markets, have fallen to low levels, suggesting that some investors may underappreciate the potential for losses and volatility going forward.  In addition, terms and conditions  in the leveraged -loan market, which provides credit to lower -rated 
companies , have eased significantly, reportedly as a result of a “reach for yield” in the 
face of persistently low interest rates.  The Federal Reserve, the O ffice of the C omptroller 
of the C urrency,  and the Federal D eposit Insurance C orporation issued guidance 
regarding leveraged lending practices in early 2013 and followed up on this guidance late last year.  To date, we do not see a systemic threat  from leveraged lending , since broad 
  - 16 - 
measures of credit outstanding do not suggest that nonfinanc ial borrowers, in the 
aggregate, are taking on excessive debt  and the improved capital and liquidity positions at 
lending institutions should ensure resilience against potential losses  due to their 
exposures .  But we are mindful  of the possibility that credit provision could accelerate , 
borrower losses could rise unexpectedly sharply , and that leverage and liquidity in the 
financial system could deteriorate.   It is therefore important that  we monitor  the degree to 
which  the macrop rudential steps we have tak en have built sufficient resilience , and  that 
we consider the deployment of other tools, including adjustments to the stance of 
monetary policy, as conditions change in potentially unexpected ways . 
Conclusion  
In closing, the policy approach to promoting financial stability has changed 
dramatically in the wake of the global financial crisis.  We have made considerable 
progress in implementing a macroprudential approach in the United States , and these 
changes have also had a significant effect on our moneta ry policy discussions .  An 
important contributor to the progress made in the United States has been the lessons we learn ed from the experience gained by central banks and regulatory authorities all around 
the world.  T he IMF plays an important role in this  evolving process  as a forum for 
representatives from the world’s economies and as an institution  charged with promoting 
financial and economic stability globally .  I expect to both contribute to and learn from 
ongoing discussions on these issues.

Thank you for inviting me to speak today.    
Climate change is real, but I do not believe it poses a serious risk to the safety and 
soundness of large banks or the financial stability of the United States.1  Risks are risks.  
There is no need for us to focus on one set of risks in a way that crowds out our focus on other s.  My job is to make sure that the financial system is resilient to a range of risks.  
And I believe risks  posed by climate change are not sufficiently unique or material to 
merit special treatment relative to other s.
2  Nevertheless, I think it’s important to continue 
doing high-quality academic research regarding the role that climate plays in economic 
outcomes , such as  the work presented at today’s conference.  
In what follows, I want to be careful not to conflate my views on climate change 
itself with my views on how we should deal with financial risks associated with climate 
change.  I believe the scientific community has rigorously established that our climate is 
changing.  But my role is not to be a climate policymaker.  Consistent with the Fed’s mandates, I must focus on financial risks, and the questions I’m exploring today are about 
whether the financial risks associated with climate change are different enough from 
other financial s tability risks to merit special  treatment.  But before getting to those 
questions , I’d like to briefly explain how we think about financial stability at the Federal 
Reserve.   
 
1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal 
Reserve Board.  
2 While the actions the Federal Reserve has taken to date are mostly in an  exploratory spirit, they could lead 
to the perception that we intend to give climate change special treatment in the future.  For example, recent 
actions include the organization of a Supervision Climate Committee and a Financial Stability Climate Committee, the issuance of Principles for Climate -Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial 
Institutions in December 2022, and the pilot Climate Scenario Analysis exercise initiated with the issuance of scenarios in January 2023.   - 2 - 
 
Financial stability is at the core of the Federal Reserve and our mission.  The 
Federal Reserve was created in 1913, following the Banking Panic of 1907,  with the goal 
of promoting financial stability and avoiding banking panics.  Responsibilities have 
evolved over the years.  In the aftermath of the 2007- 09 financial crisis, Congress 
assigned the Fed additional responsibilities related to promoting financial stability, and 
the Board of Governors significantly increased the resources dedicated to that purpose.  
Events in recent years, including the pandemic , emerging geopolitical risks, and recent 
stress in the banking sector have only highlighted the important role central banks have in 
understanding and addressing financial stability risks .  The Federal Reserve’s goal in 
financial stability is to help ensu re that financial institutions and financial markets remain 
able to provide critical services to households and businesses so that they  can continue to 
support a well -functioning economy through the business cycle.   
Much of how we think about and monitor financial stability at the Federal 
Reserve  is informed by our understanding of how shocks can propagate across financial 
markets and affect  the economy.  Economists have studied the role of debt in the 
macroeconomy dating all the way back to Irving Fisher in the 1930s, and in the past 40 
years it has been well  established that financial disruptions can reduce the efficiency of 
credit allocation and have real effects  on the broader economy.3  When borrowers’ 
financial conditions deteriorate, lenders tend to  charge higher rates on loans .  That, in 
turn, can lead to less overall lending and negativ ely affect  the broader economy.4  And in 
 
3 For example, Bernanke (1983) showed how financial disruptions  can reduce the availability of credit and 
reduce aggregate demand , and Diamond and Dybvig (1983)  showed how bank runs can affect the real 
economy. 
4 In their articulation of the financial accelerator, Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchris t (1999) demonstrate 
concepts like this.   - 3 - 
 
the wake of the 2007-09 financial crisis, we’ve learned more about the important roles 
credit growth and asset price growth play in “boom -bust” cycles .5     
  Fundamentally, financial stress emerges when someone is owed something and 
doesn’t get paid back or becomes worried they won’t be paid back.  If I take out a loan from you and can’t repay it, you take a loss.  Similarly, if I take out a mortgage from a 
bank and I can’t repay it, the bank could take a loss.  And if the bank hasn’t built 
sufficient ability to absorb those losses, it may not be able to pay its depositors back.  
These dynamics can have knock-on effects on as set prices.  For example, when people 
default on their home mortgage loans, banks foreclose and seek to sell the homes, often at steep discounts.  Th ose foreclosure sales  can have contagion effects on nearby house 
prices .
6  When a lot of households and businesses take such losses around the same time, 
it can have real effects on the economy as consumption and investment spending take a 
hit and overall trust in financial institutions wanes.  The same process works when 
market participants fear they won’t be  paid back or be able to sell their assets.  Those 
fears themselves can drive instability.  
The implication is that risks to financial stability have a couple of features.  First, 
the risks must have relatively near -term  effects , such that the risk manifesting could result 
in outstanding contracts being breached.  Second, the risks must be materi al enough to 
create losses large enough to affect  the real economy.    
These insights about vulnerabilities across the financial system inform how we 
think about monitoring financial stability at the Federal Reserve.  We identify risks and 
 
5 For example, see Schularick and Taylor (2012) ; Jorda, Schularick, and Taylor (2013) ; and Kiley (2021) . 
6 For examp le, Harding, Rosenblatt, and Yao (2009)  identify a contagion discount on properties close to 
foreclosed properties.   - 4 - 
 
prioritize resou rces around those that are most threatening to the U.S. financial system.  
We distinguish between shocks, which are inherently difficult to predict, and 
vulnerabilities of the financial system, which can be monitored through the ebb and flow 
of the economi c cycle.  If you think about it, there is a huge set of shocks that could hit at 
any given time.  Some of those shocks do hit, but most do not.  Our approach promotes general resiliency, recognizing that we can’t predict, prioritize, and tailor specific po licy 
around each and every shock that could occur .
7   
Instead, we focus on monitoring broad groups of vulnerabilities , such as 
overvalued assets , liquidity risk in the financial system,  and the amount of debt held by 
households and businesses, including banks.  This approach implies that we are 
somewhat agnostic to the particular sources of shocks that may hit the economy at any 
point in time.  Risks are risks, and from a policymaking perspective , the source of a 
particular shock isn’t as import ant as building a financial system that is resilient to the 
range of risks we face.  For example, it is plausible that shocks could stem from things 
ranging from increasing dependence on computer systems and digital technologies to a 
shrinking labor force to geopolitical risk.  Our focus  on fundamental vulnerabilities like 
asset overvaluation , excessive leverage , and liquidity risk in  part reflects our humility 
about our ability to identify the probabilities of each and every potential shock to our 
system i n real time .   
Let me provide a tangible example from our capital stress test for the largest 
banks.  We use that stress test to ensure banks have sufficient capital to withstand the types of severe credit -driven recessions we’ve experienced in the United States since 
 
7 There are also unanticipated risks, which makes it all the more important to be comprehensive and 
effective in mitigating known risks.   - 5 - 
 
World War II.8  We use a design framework for the hypothetical scenarios that  results in 
sharp declines in asset prices coupled with a steep rise in the unemployment rate, but we 
don’t detail the specific shocks that cause the recession becau se it isn’t necessary.  What 
is important is that banks have enough capital to absorb losses associated with those 
highly adverse conditions .  And the losses implied by a scenario like that are  huge: last 
year’s scenario resulted in hypothetical losses of more than $600 billion for the largest banks .  This resulted in a  decline in the ir aggregate common equity capital ratio from 
12.4 percent to 9.7 percent, which is still more than double the minimum requirement.    
That brings us back to my original questio n:  Are the financial risks stemming 
from climate change somehow different or more material such that we should give them special treatment ?  Or should our focus remain on monitoring and mitigating general 
financial system vulnerabilities, which can be aff ected by climate change over the long -
term just like  any number of other sources of risk?  B efore I answer , let me offer some 
definitions to make sure we’re all talking about the same things.   
Climate -related financial risks are generally separated into two groups:  physical 
risks and transition risks.  Physical risks include the potential higher frequency and 
severity of acute events , such as fires, heatwaves, and hurricanes, as well as slower 
moving events like rising sea levels.  Transition risks refer to those risks associated with 
an economy and society in transition to one that produces less greenhouse gas es.  These 
can owe to government  policy changes, changes in consumer preferences, and technology 
transitions.  The question is not w hether these risks could result in losses for individuals

declining asset prices tend to put significant stress on the balance sheets of the largest banks , making them 
well suited for a capital stress test.   - 6 - 
 
or companies .  The question is whether the se risks are unique enough to merit special 
treatment  in our financial stability framework .   
Let’s start with physical risks.  Unfortunately, like every ye ar, it is possible  we 
will experience forest fires, hurricanes, and other natural disasters in the coming months .  
These events, of course, are devastating to local communities.   But they are not material 
enough to pose an outsized risk to the  overall U.S. economy.   
Broadly speaking, physical risks could affect the financial system  through two 
related channels .  First, physical risks can have a direct impact on property values.  
Hurricanes, fires, and rising sea levels can all drive down the values of prop erties.  That 
in turn could put stress on financial institutions  that lend against those properties , which 
could lead them to curb their lending,  and suppress economic growth.  T he losses that 
individual  property owners can realize might  be devastating, but  evidence  I’ve seen so far  
suggests that these sort s of events don’t have much of an effect on bank performance .9  
That may be in part attributable to banks  and other investors  effectively pricing physical 
risks from climate change into loan contracts .  For example, recently researchers have 
found that heat stress —a climate physical risk that is likely to affect the economy —has 
been priced in to bond spreads and stock returns since around 2013.10  In addition, while it 
is difficult to isolate the effects  of weather events on the broader economy, there is 
evidence to suggest severe weather events like hurricanes do not likely have an outsized 
effect on growth rates  in countries like the United States .11  
 
9 Blickle, Hamerling, and Morgan (2021)  study FEMA disasters and find that they have an insignificant or 
small effect on U.S. banks’ performance.  
10 See Acharya, Johnson, Sundaresan, and Tomunen (2022) .  
11 See Linder, Peach, and Stein (2013)  for a study of  the effect of Hurricane Sandy on the economy.   - 7 - 
 
Over time, it is possible some of these physical ris ks could contribute to an 
exodus of people from certain cities or regions.  For example, some worry that rising sea 
levels could significantly change coastal regions.  While the cause may be different, the 
experience of broad property value declines is not  a new one.  We have had entire 
American cities that have experienced significant declines in population and property 
values over time.  Take, for example, Detroit.  In 1950, Detroit was the fifth largest city 
in the United States, but now it isn’t even in the top 20, after losing two -thirds of its 
population.  I’m thrilled to see that Detroit has made a comeback in recent years, but the 
relocation of the automobile industry took a serious toll on the city and its people.  Yet 
the decline in Detroit’s popul ation, and commensurate decline in property values, did not 
pose a financial stability risk to the United States.  What makes the potential future  risk 
of a population decline in coastal cities different?   
Second, and a more compelling concern, is the not ion that property value declines 
could occur more -or-less instantaneously and on a large scale when, say, property 
insurers leave a region en masse.  That sort of rapid decline in property values, which 
serve as collateral on loans, could certainly result in losses for banks and other financial 
intermediaries.  But there is a growing body of literature that suggests economic agents 
are already adjusting behavior to account for risks associated with climate change .12  That 
should mitigate the risk of these p otential “Minsky moments.”13  For the sake of 
argument though, suppose a great repricing does occur ; would those losses be big enough 
to spill over into the broader financial system?  Just as a point of comparison, let’s turn 
 
12 For example, in addition to the previously mentioned Acharya et al. paper, in a recent paper Meisenzahl 
(2023) shows that banks have reduced lending in areas more affected by climate change.  
13 Based on the w ork of economist Hyman Minsky, this is the sudden onset of a market crash when 
sentiment shifts following a period of rapid speculative growth.   - 8 - 
 
back to the stress tests I mentioned earlier.  Each year the Federal Reserve stresses  the 
largest banks against a hypothetical severe macroeconomic scenario.  The stress tests 
don’t cover all risks, of course, but that scenario typically assumes broad real estate price 
declines of more  than 25 percent across the United States.  In last year’s stress test, the 
largest banks were able to absorb nearly $100 billion in losses on loans collateralized by 
real estate, in addition to  another half a trillion dollars of losses on other positions .14 
What about transition risks?  Transition risks are generally neither near -term nor 
likely to be material given their slow -moving nature and the ability of economic agents to 
price transition costs into contracts.  There seems to be a consensus  that orderly 
transitions will not pose a risk to financial stability .15  In that case, changes would be 
gradual and predictable.  Households and businesses are generally well  prepared to adjust 
to slow -moving and predicable changes.  As are banks.  For ex ample, if banks know that 
certain industries will gradually become less profitable  or assets pledged as collateral will 
become stranded , they will account for that in their loan pricing , loan duration, and risk 
assessments.  And , because assets held by ban ks in the United States reprice in less than 
five years on average, there is  ample time to adjust to all but the most abrupt of 
transitions .16 
But what if the transition is disorderly?  One argument is that uncertainty 
associated with a disorderly transition will make it difficult for households and businesses 
 
14 Total losses were $612 billion, of which losses on first-lien mortgages, home equity, and commercial real 
estate loans were $98.8 billion.  See https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2022- dfast -results -
20220623.pdf . 
15 In their reports on climate -related ris ks to the financial system, both the Financial Stability Board (2020) 
and the Financial Stability Oversight Council (2021) indicate that risks to the financial system associated 
with an orderly transition are most likely contained.  
16 Drechsler, Savov, and Schnabl (2021) estimated the average asset repricing maturity  between 1997 and 
2013 was 4.23 years .     - 9 - 
 
to plan.  It is certainly plausible that there could be swings in policy,  and those swings 
could lead to changes in earnings expectations for companies, property values, and the 
value of commodities.  But policy development is often disorderly and subject to the 
uncertainty of changing economic realities.  In the United States, we have a long history 
of sweeping policy changes ranging from revisions to the tax code to things like changes 
in healthcare coverage and environmental policies .  While these policy changes can 
certainly  affect the composition of industries , the connection to broader financial stability 
is far less clear .  And when policies  are found to have large  and damaging consequences, 
policymakers always have, and frequently make use of , the option to adjust course to 
limit those disruptions .  
There are also concerns that  technology development associated with climate 
change will be disorderly.  Much technology development is disorderly.  T hat is why 
innovators are often referred to as “disruptors.”  So,  what makes climate-related 
innovations more disruptive or less predictable than other innovations?  Like the innovations of the automobile and the cell phone, I’d expect those stemming from the 
development of cleaner fuels and more efficient machines to be welfare -increasing  on 
net.   
So where does that leave us?  I don’t see a need for special treatment for climate-
related risks in our financial stability monitoring and policies.  As policymakers, we must 
balance the broad set of risks we face , and we have a responsibility to prioritize using 
evidence and analysis.   Based on what I’ve seen so far, I believe that placing an outsized 
focus on climate -related risks is not  needed , and the Federal Reserve should focus on 
more near -term and material risks  in keeping with our mandate .    - 10 - 
 
I’d be happy to take a few questions.

Opening Remarks  
 
 
 
by 
 
Jerome H. Powell  
 
Chair  
 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  
 
at the 
 
Gender and the Economy Conference,  a symposium hosted by 
the Division of Consumer and Community Affairs  
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  
 
Washington, D.C.  
(via webcast)

Good morning.  I am pleased to welcome everyone to today’s conference on 
gender and the economy.  Thank you for being here, for participating, and for lending 
your expertise on this important topic . 
We have gathered an impressive lineup of speakers  and panelists, who will 
address a range of ti mely and important issues.   
To open the conference, I will give a brief tour  of the important research on 
display here, then discuss how the pandemic has affected the economy along gender lines.  
Research  
The speakers and panelists will be exploring  a wide  range of topics, from a 
historical review of gender issues and the economy to how someone’s education options —and the financing of those choices —affect that person’s early career and 
financial stability.  Speakers and panelists will also be looking at the  influence of family 
and caregiving on career advancement and will discuss timely topics of wealth and retirement.     
The Pandemic and Gender  
The pandemic widened  deep -rooted inequities  in our economy.  Along racial, 
gender, and socioeconomic lines, those  least able to bear it, unfortunately, were those 
who were most affected.  Women make up the majority of frontline workers, who have been under substantial strain—and subject to personal risks —during the pandemic.  
Additionally, women took on the majority of caring responsibilities, for older relatives and children alike.  As schools closed and childcare services shuttered during the worst of the pandemic, that added responsibility and stress made working more difficult for some  - 2 - 
and took many away from thei r jobs.  These burdens are real and have been an additional 
challenge during an already challenging time.  
In a reversal of previous recessions, women  suffered more from job losses in the 
COVID- 19 recession than men.  In April 2020, the unemployment rate f or women was 
16.1 percent , compared with 13.6 percent for men.  The gap persisted until September of 
that year, and while it has since reversed, it does not account for the many women who 
left the workforce entirely.1   
Increased  childcare responsibilitie s during the pandemic also affected many 
parents’ working lives.  Mothers of small children were more likely to exit the labor force during the pandemic compared with previous periods.  These increases were larger among mothers who earned less before the pandemic.
2  
This issue was widespread and had significant financial consequences on many 
households.  The Federal Reserve’s  2020 Survey of Household Economics and 
Decisionmaking shows t hat the pandemic disrupted childcare or in- person schooling for 
nearly 70 percent of parents, with 25 percent of mothers reporting they did not work or 
worked less as a result.   Many faced substantial financial difficulty.  Only 37 percent of 
mothers who reported not working or working less because of childcare or schooling disruptions would cover a $400 expense with cash or its equivalent.  
As households and the economy continue to recover, the lessons learned during 
this er a will help inform how policymakers  and communities work to bridge those gaps.

Long-standing disparities weigh on the productive capacity of our economy, which  can 
only realize its full potential if everyone has a solid  chance to contribute to, and to reap 
the benefits of , broad- reaching  prosperity.    
Conclusion  
In closing, I want to thank you all for taking the time to join this discussion.  
These are vital issues not just to the economy, but to families across the country.  There is 
more to be done, but this conference highlights the number of world- class researchers, 
practitioners, and policymakers who are  dedicated to understanding and addressing these 
deeply entrenched issues.  
As a group, we have an opportunity to reaffirm  the importance of gender parity 
and diversity in our professions, in our research, and in our policymaking.   Thank you. ",2021-11-08,powell

 The economic recovery began more than two ye ars ago, but it doesn’t feel like 
much of a recovery for many Americans --certainly for those of you  who depend on the 
housing sector for your living , as well as  for the millions of others  who have  seen their 
home values plummet or  lost their home s through foreclosure .  Though  some progress 
has been made in reversing the losses in jobs and income  sustained during the recession, 
the pace of expansion  has been frustratingly slow  and the unemployment rate remains 
very high by historical standards .  The state of the housing sector has been a key  
impediment to a faster recovery.  In the typical economic recovery , a resurgent  housing 
sector helps fuel reemployment and rising incomes.  But as you know all too well, th at 
scenario has not played out this time .  Although the precip itous declines in construction 
that began in 2006 are , thankfully,  now behind us, homebuilding  remains depressed  in 
most areas , relative both  to where it was before the downturn and to where it will need to 
be to meet the needs of a growing population in t he longer term .   
The Federal Reserve has a keen interest in the state of housing and has been 
actively  engaged in analyzing the housing and mortgage market s.1  Issues related to the 
housing market and housing finance are important factors in the Federal R eserve’s 
various roles  in formulating monetary policy, regulating banks, and protecting consumers 
of financial services.   Traditionally, mortgage interest rates have been a  key transmission 
                                                 
1 These remarks draw heavily on research conducted by Federal Reserve staff, including work presented in 
the white paper on the U.S. housing market that was transmitted to the Congress in January (see Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2012), “The U.S. Housing Market:  Current Conditions and 
Policy Considerations,” white paper  (Washington:  Board of Governors, January), 
http://federalreserve.gov/publications/other -reports /files/housing -white -paper -20120104.pdf) and in a 
publication on real estate owned and vacant properties (see Federal Reserve Banks of Boston and 
Cleveland and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2010), REO and Vacant Properties:  
Strateg ies for Neighborhood Stabilization , report (Washington:  Board of Governors, September),

 channel of monetary policy ; and banks’ mortgage lending policies d irectly affect their 
own safety and soundness  as well as  the access of creditworthy households to mortgage 
credit .  My remarks today will focus on current housing market conditions  and on how 
housing problems have affected  borrowers, lenders, communities, and the broader 
economy .  I’ll also discuss  some specific sources of our housing problems , including  
tight conditions  in the mortgage market and  the overhang of foreclosed and vacant 
homes.  
Overview of the State of the Hou sing Market  
One way to understand conditions in  the housing market is to focus on the balance 
of supply and demand .  For the past few years, the actual and potential supply of single -
family ho mes has greatly exceeded the effective demand.  The elevated number of homes 
that are currently vacant instead of  owner  occupied reflects the imbalance .  According to 
the most recent  estimate, about 1 -3/4 million homes are currently unoccupied  and for 
sale.  While this figure has declin ed slightly during the past few years, it is nonetheless up 
dramatically from the first half of the 2000s , when readings  of about 1-1/4 million  vacant 
homes  were the norm.  Of course,  housing conditions vary by region, and  vacancy rates 
in some locations a re substantial ly higher than the national average.  For example, here in 
Florida the homeowner vacancy rate in the third  quarter of 2011 averaged 3.2 percent, 
compared with the national average of 2.4 percent.2   
Moreover, a very large number of additional  homes are poised to come on the 
owner -occupied  market.  In each of the past few years, roughly 2 million homes have 
entered the foreclosure process, and many  of these homes have  been put up for sale , 
                                                 
2 National and state level homeowner vacancy rates are available on the U.S. Census Bureau website at 
www.census.gov/hhes/www/housing/hvs/ charts/index.html.  - 3 - 
 
 
 crowding out much of the need for new building.   Lookin g ahead,  the relatively high rate 
of foreclosures is likely to continue for a while, putting additional homes on the market  
and dislocating families  and disrupting communities  in the process . 
At the same time, a number of factors are constraining demand.  Household 
formation has been down, particularly among young adults.  High unemployment and 
uncertain job prospects may have  reduced the willingness of some households to commit 
to homeownership .  Availability of mortgage credit is an important constraint, to which I 
will return later.  Additionally, housing may no longer be viewed as the secure 
investment it once was thought to be, given uncertainty about future home prices  and the 
economy more generally .   
Not surprisingly, the large imbalance of supply an d demand  has been reflected in 
a drop in home values of historic proportions.  Nationally , hou se prices have plunged 
about 30  percent in nominal terms from their peak and nearly 40  percent in real, or 
inflation -adjusted, terms.  The imbalance of supply and demand has also been reflected in 
the decline in home construction that I mentioned earlier.  Since 2009, the pace of single -
family housing starts has averaged less than 500,000  units per year.  During the 15 years 
before the financial crisis, the pace of  single -family starts had never  fallen below 
1 million units per year.  
In contrast to the situation for owner -occupied homes, rental markets ar ound the 
country have strengthened  somewhat .  In particular, vacancy rates for rental properties 
have declined and  now stand near the lower end of their range over the p ast eight years .  
Not surprisingly, rents have been increasing and the construction of apartment buildings  
has picked up .  - 4 - 
 
 
 To recap , the housing sector continues to suffer from  serious imbalances --a 
marked excess supply for owner -occupied housing  accompanied by  a stronger  rental 
markets .  The narrative of the housing market over the next several years will revolve 
around the resolution of those imbalances.      
Broade r Implications of the  Problems in the Housing Market   
As homebuilders, you naturally  pay close attention  to the demand for new homes 
and the ir prices.  These factors are important for the health of your industry, including its 
ability to create jobs in con struction and related activities.  But the problems in housing 
also have important implications outside the construction industry.  
For instance, consider the effects on neighborhoods and communities.  
Foreclosures , particularly when they  are geographically  concentrated, can diminish the 
values of  nearby properties . 3  Many foreclosed homes are neglected or abandoned, as 
legal proceedings or other factors delay their resale.   Deteriorating or vacant properties 
can, in turn,  directly affect the quality of life in a neighborhood , for example, by leading 
to increases in vandalism or crime .  Moreover, the continuing price declines typical in 
neighborhoods with many foreclosures  depress  the tax base o f the community.  A  vicious 
circle can get started:  Increasing vacancies together with d ecreas ing tax revenue and 
consequent cutbacks in services can further depress home prices, putting the goal of 
neighborhood stabilization even further out of reach.

 As I mentioned earlier, p roblem s in the housing market have also restrained the 
broader economic recovery.  For example, by some estimates, declines in house prices 
have reduced homeowners’ equity by  more than 50 percent in the aggregate since the 
peak of the housing boom, resulting in more than a  $7 trillion loss of household  wealth.4  
Indeed , about 12 million homeowners --more than 1 out of 5 with a  mortgage --are 
underwater , meaning they owe more on their mortgages than their home s are worth .  One 
of the effects of d eclines in housing wealth is to reduce the ability and willingness of 
households to spend.  While e stimates vary, homeowners are believed to spend 
somewhere between $3 and $ 5 per year less for every $100 of housing value lost.5  Based 
on those estimates, i t appears that recent declines in housing wealth may be reducing  
consumer spending  between $200  billion and $ 375 billion per year.   That reduction  
corresponds to lower living standards for many Americans.  And, importantly, lower 
sales of goods and service s also reduce  the incentives of firms to invest and hire , thereby 
slowing the recovery.   Of course, these consumer -related effects are on top of the direct 
consequences of low rates of home construction for job creation and income.  
 Low or negative equity creates additional problems  for households .  It reduces 
financial flexibility:  Homeowners who are underwater on their mortgages cannot tap

 home equity to pay for emergency health expenses or their children’s college education s.  
Mobility may be affected t o some degree; underwater borrower s who ha ve difficulty 
selling their home s may find it more difficult to move to take new job s.  Moreover, 
homeowners with underwater mortgages may find it difficult or impossible to take 
advantage  of low interest  rates by refinancing their mortgages, even if they are current on 
their payments.6   
The state of housing and mortgage markets may also be holding back the recovery 
of our financial system  and the normalization of credit conditions .  Mortgage 
delinquencies surg ed between 2007 and 2009 and remain high, imposing losses on 
lenders , mortgage insurers , and investors .  Although some of the losses were the result of 
poorly underwritten mortgages, an increasing  share of losses have arisen from prime 
mortgages that were  originally fully  documented with significant down payments , but 
that have  default ed due to the weak economy  and housing market .  The Federal Reserve 
and other bank regulators have used stress tests and other tools to help ensure that banks 
have enough capi tal to cover mortgage losses while continuing to lend.  On the margin, 
though, some lenders might be inclined to respond to losses by tightening credit terms or 
being more cautious about extending loans rather than by raising additional capital.7  In

financial positions, see Christopher Mayer, Karen Pence, and Shane M. Sherlund (2009), “The Rise in 
Mortgage Defaults,” Journal of Economic Persp ectives , vol. 23 (Winter), pp. 27 -50. 
7 The effect of bank capital on lending is a critical determinant of the linkage between financial conditions 
and real activity, and has received special attention in the recent financial crisis.  Modest effects of ban k 
capital ratio changes on lending are reported in Jose M. Berrospide and Rochelle M. Edge (2010), “The 
Effects of Bank Capital on Lending:  What Do We Know, and What Does It Mean?”  International Journal 
of Central Banking,  vol. 6 (December), pp. 5 -54.

 short , housing  problems  affect the homebuilding industry, of course, but also ha ve much 
broader effects --on neighborhoods and communities, on homeowners, on the financial 
system, and on the vitality of the economy as a whole.   This observation underscores the 
importance of efforts  to improve the condition of the housing market.  
Availability of Mortgage Credit     
So why has the recovery in housing been so slow?  One important factor is 
restraints on mortgage credit.  Since its peak in 2007, U.S. home mortgage credit 
outstanding has contracted  about 13 percent in real terms .  In prior recoveries, mortgage 
credit had begun to grow four years after the business cycle peak --but not this time 
around .8   
One reason for the very slow  recovery  in mortgage  credit, despite m onetary 
policy actions that have helped drive  mortgage rates to historically low levels, is that 
many lending institutions  have tightened underwriting  conditions dramatically , relative to 
the pre -recession period .9  Given the lax standard s during the credit boom, some 
tightening was doubtless appropriate to protect consumers and ensure lenders’ safety and 
soundness.   However, current lending practices appear to reflect, in part, obstacles that 
are limit ing or prevent ing lending even to creditworthy households.

8 For an analysis of four types of credit --home mortgages, commercial mortgages, consumer credit, and 
nonfinancial business credit --around business cycle peaks since 1952, see Diana Hancock and Rochelle M. 
Edge (2009), “U.S. Credit Cycles:  Past and Present,” study available at

9 For example, bank responses to the Federal Reserve Board’s qu arterly Senior Loan Officer Opinion 
Survey on Bank Lending Practices indicate net tightening in lending standards for mortgage originated 
from 2007 through 2009.  Surveys since then have yet to provide evidence of unwinding that tightness even 
for prime mo rtgages that can be backed by guarantees from Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or the Federal 
Housing Administration.  - 8 - 
 
 
 For example, m ortgage originators appear to be reluctant to extend  credit to  some  
potential borrowers who could meet the underwriting standards currently set by the 
government -sponsored enterprises (GSEs).  Indeed, f ewer than half of lenders are 
offering mortgages to borrowers with a FICO score of 620 and a down payment of 
10 percent, even though such loans could be within the GSE purchase parameters.10  A 
number of possib ilities could expla in this reluctance to lend .  In some cases,  borrowers 
cannot obtain private mortgage insurance required by  the GSE s.  Thus, the weakened 
financ es of private mortgage insurers could be damp ing mortgage credit availability for 
some potential borrowers.   In other cases, lender s may be concerned about high servicing 
costs if mortgage s become delinquent .  Another set of concerns relates to so -called 
representations  and warrant ies, which are contractual commitments by an originator 
concerning the quality of the loan.  These contracts were designed to protect the GSEs  or 
other purchasers of loans , but originators appear uncertain about how they will be 
enforced  going forward  and thus have been very cautious about making loans that could 
be viewed as less than perfect  from an underwriting perspective .  Learning from our 
experience with securitizations over the past decade, lenders and regulators alike should  
look carefully  at rules and practices  that may unduly diminish the origination  of 
prudently underwritten mortgages . 
Another  reason for  tight lending standards is that private -label mortgage 
securitizations  have virtually disappeared .  The difficulty of funding loans in the private -
label securitization market may have discouraged lenders from originating loans to some 
                                                 
10 FICO scores are based on information that a credit bureau (for example, Experian, TransUnion , and 
Equifax) keeps on an individual.  The higher the score, which ranges from 300 to 850, the lower the credit 
risk.  Credit scores are used to inform lenders when they assess an individual’s credit risk.  See Board of 
Governors, “The U.S. Housing Market ,” p. 6 (see note 1).   - 9 - 
 
 
 borrowers who may be  creditworthy b ut may not exactly fit the criteria of the GSEs or 
the Federal Housing Administration  (FHA) . 
Potential first -time homebuyers have been disproportionately affected by the  very 
tight conditions in mortgage markets.   Lending to potential first-time homebuyers  has 
dropped precipitously,  even in parts of the country where unemployment rates and 
housing conditions are better than the national average .  Indeed , the propensity of 
younger households --headed by adults aged 29 to 34 --to take out their first mortgage h as 
been much lower recently than it was 10 years ago , a period well before the most recent 
run-up in home prices.11  First-time homebuyers are typically an important source of 
incremental housing demand , so their smaller presence in the market affects house  prices 
and construction quite broadly .12  Moreover, the lack of demand from first -time 
homebuyers  may prevent current homeowners  from moving up to larger homes, for 
example, to accommodate growing families.       
An additional issue  is the implication of ti ght mortgage credit conditions for 
monetary policy.  Because some creditworthy households are finding it difficult to obtain 
mortgage credit or to refinance, the strong actions taken by the Federal Reserve to put 
downward pressure on longer -term rates and to improve financial conditions have had 
less effect on the housing sector and overall  econom ic activity  than they otherwise would 
have had.   
                                                 
11 For example, consumer credit record data show that the share of 29 - to 34 -year-olds obtaining their first 
mortgage was significantly lower in the past two years (mid -2009 to mid -2011) at 9 percent than it was 
10 years earlier (mid -1999 to mid -2011) at 17 percent.

 The problem of tight mortgage credit will not be solved easily or quickly .  The 
Federal Reserve, in its supervisor y capacity , continues to encourage lenders to find ways 
to maintain prudent lending standards while serving creditworthy borrowers .  But the 
slow recovery of the housing market and the economy, continued uncertainty surrounding 
the future of the GSEs and t he regulatory environment for mortgage lending, the likely 
continued absence of a private -label market, and more cautious attitudes by lenders are 
all barriers to rapid normalization of the flow of mortgage credit.   
Overhang of Empty and Foreclosed Homes  
To date, policymakers have been focus ing on refinancing creditworthy (but 
sometimes underwater ) borrowers, on loan modification s, and on other ways to avert 
additional foreclosures.  This work is obviously very important.  But unfortunately , not 
all forecl osures can be prevented .  Given the weak economy and high unemployment  
rates , some borrowers simply do not have the wherewithal to meet monthly mortgage 
payments even if their loans were to be substantially modified .  Therefore, we have seen 
increased inte rest in whether anything can be done to reduce  the overhang of empty and 
foreclosed homes.13 
We estimate that about one -fourth  of the excess supply of vacant homes for sale 
in the second quarter of 2011 was  owned  by credito rs; these homes are  often referred to 
as real estate owned , or REO properties.14  Moreover , Federal Reserve staff estimate that 
distressed sales, which include both short sales and non -auction sales of foreclosed 
                                                 
13 For a discussion of some of the tradeoffs that poli cymakers might take into account in considering 
whether to expand these efforts to reduce the overhang of empty and foreclosed homes further, see Board 
of Governors,  “The U.S. Housing Market ” (see note 1).  
14 The inventory of REO for sale is roughly 140,000  units above its 2004 level, while the inventory of 
vacant homes for sale is roughly 600,000 units above its 2004 level, per Federal Reserve staff calculations 
based on data from CoreLogic and the Housing Vacancy Survey.  - 11 - 
 
 
 homes by REO holders, now account for 30 percent of home sales.   Although it is 
difficult to forecast future REO flows, we estimate that  an additional  1 million foreclosed 
properties could  be added to the  REO held by banks, guarantors, and servicers  in each of 
the next few years .  The se inflows will continue to exert  downward pressure on home 
prices.    
In contrast to the markets for owner -occupied homes, rental housing markets 
across the nation ha ve recently strengthened somewhat , as I mentioned earlier .  Fueled by 
increased demand from families who are either unable o r reluctant to purchase homes , 
rents are up and vacancy rates for multifamily properties are down in most metropolitan 
areas.     
With home prices  falling  and rents rising , it could  make sense in some markets to 
turn some of the foreclosed homes into renta l properties.  According to Federal Reserve 
staff calculations, most REO properties are in neighborhoods with median house values 
and incomes that are roughly similar to the medians for the metropolitan area overall.15  
Moreover, these  properties are not un usually far, in terms of  commut ing times, from 
where jobs are located.16  We have compared comp utation s of the expected annual cash 
flows from renting properties to  the discounted prices that REO property holders 
typically receive when selling a home .  The comparison suggest s that some REO holders 
might come out ahead by renting, rather than by selling, some of their properties.   
                                                 
15 More precisely, Federal Reserve s taff estimate that about 75 percent of REO properties are in 
neighborhoods where the median house values and incomes are greater than 80 percent of the medians for 
the metropolitan area.  
16 Data on median home values, income, and commute times are from the 2000 census, available on the 
U.S. Census Bureau website at www.census.gov/main/www/cen2000.html.  - 12 - 
 
 
 Moreover, k eeping paying tenants in homes --including leasing to the former 
owners  at market rents --may, in some cases, be the best way to maintain property values 
and the quality of neighborhoods.  REO -to-rental programs could potentially also 
minimize the amount of time that a vacant property languishes  in REO inventory.  That 
is, appropriately structured programs could  help some involuntary renters become owners 
again by giving them options to purchase the homes they are renting .   
REO -to-rental programs are not a “silver bullet”  for the housing market, and, 
indeed, implementing them presents some challenges.   For example, s elling the properties 
in bulk to investors to rent out has proven difficult at times because of lack of financing , 
although the GSEs have just announced a pilot program to facilitate such purchases .  In 
addition, many REO properties may not be appropriate for REO -to-rental programs, 
either because they are in very poor condition or because they are not part of a 
sufficiently large cluster of properties to allow for economies of scale in their 
management.  
Nevertheless, REO -to-rental programs appear to have some potential for success .  
As of early November 2011, about 60 metropolitan areas each had at least 250 REO 
properties for sale by the GSEs and the FHA --a scale that could be large enough to 
realize efficiency gains.17  Atlanta has the largest number of R EO properties for sale by 
these institutions, with about 5,000 units.  The next -largest inventories are in the 
metropolitan areas of Chicago ; Detroit ; Phoenix ; Riverside , Calif ornia ; and Las Vegas, 
                                                 
17  Federal  Reserve staff calculations from data on the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s 
Real-Estate Owned Properties Portal, available at www.hud user.org/reo/reo.html.  Recently, only around 
half of the properties in the REO inventories of the GSEs have been offered for sale at any given point.  
The other properties are leased to existing tenants under the provisions of the Protecting Tenants at 
Foreclosure Act, are located in states with a redemption period after foreclosure, or are under renovation or 
otherwise unavailable for sale.  - 13 - 
 
 
 each of which have between 2,000 and 3,000 units.  As I no ted, not all REO properties 
are appropriate for rental, but many do appear to be physical ly adequa te and potential ly 
attractive to tenants.  The number of properties suitable for rental is bound to increase, as 
the number of properties currently in the for eclosure process is more than four times the 
number of properties in the REO inventory.  
Other o ptions can help with  foreclosed houses that have  low value and are in poor 
condition , homes that  are not likely to be dealt with adequately through the private 
market.  For example, land banks could handle some of these  properties.  Land banks are 
typically governmental entities that have the ability to purchase and sell real estate, clear 
titles, and accept donated properties.  Properties may be rehabilitated as rental or owner -
occupied housing or , in extreme cases , demolished, depending on the needs of individual 
markets.  While land banks are a promising option, only some states have passed 
legislation to establish land banks , and most existing land banks lack t he resources to 
keep pace with the number of low -value properties in the current inventory.  It  is, of 
course,  critical that  local governments pursuing land banking, or similar strategies,  have 
staff members with the appropriate skills a s well as adequate  oversight to ensure that 
public funds  are employed efficiently.   
REO -to-rental programs , land banks, and other neighborhood stabilization efforts  
are just a few examples of the approaches that policymakers could consider  to help 
facilitate the adjustment of the housing market.18  To be sure , every program requires 
                                                 
18 Other potential approaches include loan modification programs, principal reduction protocols, and the 
use of short  sales and deeds -in-lieu of foreclosure.  Such approaches are discussed in Board of Governors, 
“The U.S. Housing Market ” (see note 1).  - 14 - 
 
 
 careful analysis to ensure that it is effective and meets reasonable cost -benefit tests.  
Experimentation with alternative approaches could help  find the best way forwar d.  
Conclusion  
In sum , the economic r ecovery has been disappointing  in part because U.S. 
housing markets remain  out of balance .  Many local markets hav e an overhang of empty 
and foreclosed homes , and many potentially creditworthy homebuyers cannot obtain 
mort gages.  The weak  housing market also impairs homeowners ’ financial health  and 
diminishes the quality and stability of neighborhoods and communities.  For these 
reasons, and because the troubled housing market depresses  construction activity and 
employment, we need to continue to develop and implement policies that will help the 
housing sector get back on its feet .  No single solution  will be  sufficient .  But sustained 
efforts to address the many interlocking factors hol ding back the housing market will pay 
dividends in the long run.  ",2012-02-10,bernanke

Nine years into an expansion that has sometimes proceeded slowly, the U.S. 
economy is performing very well.  Growth is meaningfully above most estimates of its 
long-term trend --though admittedly, that trend is not as strong as we would like it to be .  
The labor market is particularly robust , with unemployment at its lowest level since April 
2000.  Inflation has moved up close to our 2 percent objective, although we have yet to 
see it remain near that objective on a sustained basis.   
Today, most Americans who want jobs can find them.  High demand for workers 
should support wage growth and labor force participation--the latter a measure on which 
the United States now lags most other advanced economies.1  A tight labor market may 
also lead businesses to invest more in technology and training, which should support 
productivity growth.  And groups such as some racial and ethnic minorities that still have 
higher unemployment and lower participation rates could see increasing benefits from a 
tight labor market.2  In short, there is a lot to like about low unemployment.    
Achieving our statutory goal of maximum em ployment in a context of price 
stability and financial stability is both our responsibility and our challenge.  Earlier in the 
expansion, as the economy recovered, the need for highly accommodative monetary 
policy was clear.  But with unemployment low and expected to decline further , inflation 
close to our objective , and the risks to the outlook roughly  balanced , the case for 
continued gradual increases in the federal funds rate is strong.

2 These groups tend to both suffer most from labor market downturns and benefit most from improving 
labor markets.   - 2 - 
Current L abor M arket Conditions  
At 3.8 percent, the unemployment  rate is below most estimates of its long -run 
level, which are now clustered in the mid- 4s.  Many other labor market indicators also 
suggest an economy near full employment.  To name just a few, these indicators include 
an elevated level of job vacancies.  For the first time since the Labor Department began 
collecting the data in 2000, there are now more job vacancies than there are people 
counted as unemployed.  In addition, the rate at which workers are quitting their jobs is 
elevated, a sign that workers  are able to find another job when they seek one.  And 
surveys show that businesses are finding it difficult to fill vacancies , and that households 
perceive jobs as plentiful.   
Some other indicators are less clear.  The labor force participation rate of p rime-
age workers has moved up in recent years but remains below pre -crisis levels.3  In 
addition, wage growth has been moderate, consistent with low productivity growth but 
also an indication that the labor market is not excessively tight.    
Looking ahead , the job market is likely to strengthen further.  Real gross domestic 
product in the United States is now reported to have risen 2- 3/4 percent over the past four 
quarters, well above most estimates of its long -run trend.  Expansionary fiscal policy is 
expected to add to aggregate demand over the next few years.  Many forecasters expect 
the unemployment rate to fall into the mid -3s and to remain there for an extended period.  
If that comes to pass, it will mean the lowest unemployment in the United States s ince the 
late 1960s. 
                                                 
3 The labor force participation rate is defined as the number of people either with a job or who have actively 
looked for work within the past four weeks, a s a share of the total population.  Prime -age refers to 
individuals from 25 to 54 years old.   - 3 - 
A historical comparison 
Because we have so little experience with very low unemployment, it is 
interesting to compare today’s labor market with  that earlier period.  Unemployment was 
below 4 percent from February 1966 through January 1970.  During that time, inflation as 
measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures increased from 
below 2 percent in 1965 to about 5 percent in 1970.  In hindsight, unemployment is now 
widely thought to have been unsustainably low at that time and to have contributed to 
escalating inflation.   
But how significant is this precedent for today?  The U.S. economy has changed 
in many ways over the past 50 years.  By some estimates, the natural rate of 
unemployment is substantially lower now.4  For example, the Congressional Budget 
Office now estimates that the natural rate was about 5 -3/4 percent (and rising) in the late 
1960s, compared with  4-3/4 percent at present.5   
Rising education levels do point to a decline in the natural rate since the 1960s, 
because more highly educated people are less likely to be unemployed.  The share of the 
population with a college degree has risen from less than 15 percent in the late 1960s to 
nearly 40 percent now, and the share with less than a high school degree has declined 
                                                 
4 The natural rate of unemployment is the unemployment rate over the longer term that is consistent with 
low and stable inflation.  It comprises both the “friction al” unemployment of people who are temporarily 
between jobs or searching as they have reentered the labor force and the more “structural” unemployment 
of people whose skills or physical location are not a good match for the jobs available.  For more 
discus sion, see Janet L. Yellen (2017), “The Goals of Monetary Policy and How We Pursue Them,” speech 
delivered at the Commonwealth Club, San Francisco, January 18, 
https://www. federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20170118a.htm . 
5 Contemporaneous estimates of the natural rate (or “full employment”) from the late 1960s were lower 
than current estimates for that period.  For example, the Economic Report of the President  from 1968 
defined potential output as occurring when the unemployment rate is 4 percent.  See Executive Office of 
the President of the United States (1968), Economic Report of the President  (Washington:  U.S. 
Government Printing Office, February), p. 61,  http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/economic_reports/1968.pdf .   - 4 - 
from 45 percent to about 5 percent.6  Another important difference from the 1960s is that 
inflation has been low and stable for an extended period, which has better anchored 
inflation expectations.  Today policymakers have a greater appr eciation of the role 
expectations play in inflation dynamics  and a clearer commitment to maintaining low and 
stable inflation.   
Unfortunately, with the passage of a half -century and important changes in the 
structure of our economy and in central bank pra ctices, in my view the historical 
comparison does not shed as much light  as we might have hoped.  
Questions prompted by a tight labor market  
The lack of useful historical precedent leaves us with some uncertainty about the 
answers to several  important and challenging questions .  First, estimates of the natural 
rate of unemployment by F ederal O pen M arket C ommittee  (FOMC) participants and 
others have drifted lower as unemployment has declined without much apparent reaction 
from inflation.  How reliable are these estimates?  Natural rate estimates have always 
been uncertain, and may be even more so now as inflation has becom e less responsive to 
the unemployment rate .7  The anchoring of expectations is a welcome development and 
                                                 
6 Other changes in the workforce since the late 1960s seem less likely to have much affected the natural 
rate of unemployment .  Th ere are many more women in the workforce now, but while women used to have 
higher unemployment rates than men, that is no longer the case.  And while younger workers tend to have 
less stable employment patterns and higher unemployment rates than older workers, the working 
population is , on net , only a little bit older now than it was in the late 1960s.   (The average age of people in 
the workforce declined through the 1970s as more of the baby -boom generation entered their working 
years , but it increased sub sequently. ) 
7 For evidence on the changing effects of labor market utilization on inflation, internationally as well as in 
the U nited States, see Olivier  Blanchard, Eugenio Cerutti, and Lawrence Summers (2015), “Inflation and 
Activity --Two Explorations and T heir Monetary Policy Implications,” in Inflation and Unemployment in 
Europe,  proceedings of the 2015 ECB Forum on Central Banking (Sintra, Portugal:  European Central 
Bank) , pp. 25- 46, 
www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/ecbforumoncentralbanking2015en.pdf .  Regarding uncertainty about 
estimates of the natural rate, a classic reference is Douglas Staiger, James H. Stock, and Mark W. Watson 
(1997), “How  Precise Are Estimates of the Natural Rate of Unemployment? ” in Christina D. Romer and  - 5 - 
has likely played a role in flattening the Phillips curve.  But a flatter Phillips curve makes 
it harder to assess whether movements in inflation refle ct the cyclical position of the 
economy or other influences.   
Second, what would be  the consequences for inflation if unemployment were to 
run well below the natural rate for an extended period?  The flat Phillips curve suggests 
that the implications for inflation might not be large, although a very tight labor market 
could lead to larger, nonlinear effects.  Research on this question is ambiguous, again 
reflecting the limited historical experience.8  We should also remember that where 
inflation expectatio ns are well anchored, it is likely because central banks have kept 
inflation under control.  If central banks were instead to try to exploit the 
nonresponsiveness of inflation to low unemployment and push resource utilization 
significantly and persistently  past sustainable levels, the public might begin to question 
our commitment to low inflation, and expectations could come under upward pressure.  
So far, we see no signs of this.  If anything, some measures of longer -term inflation 
expectations in the U nited States have edged lower in recent years.  
Third, can persistently strong economic conditions pose financial stability risks?  
Of course, strong economic conditions are a good thing!  Such conditions can make the 
financial system better able to absorb shocks through strong balance sheets and investor 
confidence.  But we have often seen confidence become overconfidence and lead to 
excessive borrowing and risk- taking, leaving the financial system more vulnerable.

Indeed, the fact that the two  most recent U. S. recessions stemmed principally from 
financial imbalances, not high inflation , highlights the importance of closely monitoring 
financial conditions .  Today I see U.S. financial stability vulnerabilities as moderate and 
broadly in line with their long -run averages.  While some asset prices are high by 
historical standards, I do not see broad signs of excessive borrowing or leverage.  In 
addition, banks have far greater levels of capital and liquidity than before the crisis.   
Fourth, while persistently str ong economic conditions can pose risks to inflation 
and perhaps financial stability, we can also ask whether there may be lasting benefits.  As 
I mentioned, a tight labor market could draw more people into the labor force.  In fact, as 
the labor market has  tightened, more workers have been moving back to work and off 
disability rolls.9  There could also be benefits to productivity and potential growth.  All 
told, though, the persistence of any such “positive hysteresis” benefits is  uncertain, since , 
again, the historical evidence is sparse and inconclusive. 
Conclusion  
As is often the case, in the current environment , significant uncertainty  attends the 
process of making monetary policy.  Today, with the economy strong and risks to the 
outlook balance d, the case for continued gradual increases in the federal funds rate 
remains strong and broadly supported among FOMC participants.

Rebalancing the Global Recovery  
 
Remarks by  
Ben S. Bernanke  
Chairman  
Board  of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  
at the  
Sixth European Central Bank Central Banking Conference  
Frankfurt, Germany  
   
November 19, 2010   
The global economy is now well into its second year of recovery  from the  deep 
recession triggered by the most devastating financial crisis since the Great Depression.   In 
the most intense phase of the crisis , as a  financial  conflagration  threatened to engulf  the 
global economy , policymakers in both advanced and emerging market economies found 
themsel ves confronting common challenges.  Amid this shared sense of urgency , national  
policy responses were forceful, timely, and mutually reinforcing .  This policy 
collaboration was  essential in averting a much deeper global economic contraction and 
providing a foundation for renewed stability and growth.   
In recent months, however, that sense of common purpose  has waned.  Tensions 
among nations over economic policies have emerged and intensified, potentially 
threatening our ability to find global solutions to global problems.  One  source of these 
tensions  has been the bifurcated nature of the global economic recover y:  Some 
economies  have fully recouped their losses while others  have  lagged behind.  But at a 
deeper level, the tensions ar ise from the lack of an agreed -upon framework to ensure that 
national policies take appropriate account of interdependencies across countries  and the 
interests of the international system as a whole.  Accordingly, the essential challenge for 
policymakers around the world is to work together to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome --namely , a robust global economic expansion that is balanced, sustainable, and 
less prone to cris es.   
The Two -Speed Global Recovery  
International policy cooperation is especially difficult now because of the two-
speed nature  of the global recovery.  Specifically, as shown in figure  1, since the recovery 
began, economic growth in the emerging market economies (the dashed blue line) has far - 2 - 
 
 
 outstripped  growth  in the advanced economies (the solid red line).   The se differences are 
partially attributable to  longer -term differences in growth potential  between t he two 
groups of countries, but to a significant extent they also reflect the relatively weak pace 
of recovery thus far in the advanced economies .  This point is illustrated by figure 2, 
which  shows the level s, as opposed to the growth rates, of real gross domestic product 
(GDP) for the two groups of countries.  As you can see, generally speaking, output in the advanced economies ha s not returned to the levels prevailing before the crisis , and real 
GDP in these economies  remains  far below  the l evels  implied by pre -crisis trends.   In 
contrast , economic activity in  the emerging market economies has not only fully made up 
the losses induced by the global recession, but  is also rapidly approaching its  pre-crisis 
trend .  To cite some illustrative numbers , if we were to extend forward from the end of 
2007 the 10- year trends in output for the two groups of countries, we would find that  the 
level of output in the advanced economies is currently about 8 percent below its longer -
term trend,  whereas econ omic activity in the emerging markets is only about 1 -1/2 
percent below the corresponding  (but much steeper)  trend  line for that group of countries.  
Indeed, f or some emerging market economies, the crisis appears to have left  little lasting  
imprint on grow th.  Notably, since the beginning of 2005, real output has risen more than 
70 percent in China and about 55 percent in India.  
In the United States, the recession officially ended in mid- 2009, and--as  shown in 
figure  3--real GDP growth was  reasonably  strong i n the fourth quarter  of 2009 and the 
first quarter of this year.  However, m uch of that  growth appears to have stemmed from 
transitory  factors, including  inventory adjustments and fiscal stimulus .  Since the second 
quarter of this year , GDP growth  has moderated to around 2 percent  at an annual rate, - 3 - 
 
 
 less than the Federal Reserve’s estimates  of U.S. potential growth and insufficient to 
meaningful ly reduce unemployment .  And indeed, a s figure 4 shows, the U.S. 
unemployment rate ( the solid black line) has stagnated for about eighteen months  near 10 
percent of the labor force, up from about 5 percent before the crisis ; the increase of 5 
percentage points in the U.S. unemployment rate is roughly double  that seen in the euro 
area, the United Ki ngdom, Japan, or Canada .  Of some 8.4 million  U.S.  jobs  lost between 
the peak of the expansion and the end of 2009, only about  900,000 have been restored  
thus far .  Of course, t he jobs gap is presumably even lar ger if one takes into account the 
natural inc rease in the size of the working age population over the past three years .   
Of particular concern  is the substantial increase in the  share of unemployed 
workers  who have been without work for six months or more  (the dashed red line  in 
figure 4) .  Long -term unemployment  not only imposes extreme hardship on jobless 
people  and their families , but, by eroding these workers’ skills and weakening their 
attachment to the labor force, it may also convert what might otherwise be temporary 
cyclical unemployment into much more intractable long -term structural unemployment.  
In addition, persistently high unemployment, through its adverse effects on household 
income and confidence, could threaten the strength and sustainability of the recovery.  
Low rates of resource utilization in the United States are creating disinflationary 
pressures.   As shown in figure  5, various measures  of underlying inflation have been 
trending downward and are currently around 1 percent , which is below  the rate of 
2 percent or a bit  less that most Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants  
judge as being most consistent with the Federal Reserve’s  policy objectives  in the long - 4 - 
 
 
 run.1
Monetary Policy  in the United States    With inflation expectations stable, and with levels of resource slack expected to 
remain high, inflation trends are expected to be quite subdued for some time. 
Because the genesis  of the financial crisis was in the  United States and other  
advanced economies, the much weaker recovery in those economies compared with  that 
in the emerging markets  may not be entirely unexpected  (although, given their traditional 
vulnerability  to crises , the resilience of the  emerging market  economies  over the past few 
years  is both notable  and encouraging).  What is clear is that the  different cyclical 
positions of the advanced and emerging market economies call for different policy 
settings.  Although the details of the outl ook vary among jurisdictions, most  advanced 
economies  still need  accommodative policies to continue to lay the groundwork for a 
strong, durable recovery .  Insufficiently supportive policies  in the advanced economies  
could undermine the recover y not only in those  economies , but for the world as a whole .  
In contrast, emerging market economies increasingly face the challenge of maintaining 
robust growth while avoiding  overheating , which may in some cases involve  the 
measured withdrawal of policy s timulus.  
Let me address the case of the United States specifically.  As I described, the U.S. 
unemployment rate is high and, given the slow pace of economic growth, likely to remain 
so for some time.  Indeed,  although I expect  that growth will pick up and unemployment 
will decline somewhat next year,  we cannot rule out the possibility  that unemployment 
might rise further  in the near term , creating added risks for the recovery.  Inflation has 
                                                           
1 Figure  5 shows core and trimmed -mean measures to better display the decline in underlying , or trend , 
inflation.  Total inflation measures have been volatile in recent years but are currently a bit above  1 percent 
on a 12- month basis.  Projections by FOMC participants have indicated that, under appropriate monetary 
policies, inflation as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures should converge 
to 2 percent or a bit less in the long run . - 5 - 
 
 
 declined noticeably since the busine ss cycle peak , and further disinfla tion c ould hinder 
the recovery .  In particular, w ith shorter -term nominal interest rates close to zero, 
declines in actual and expected inflation imply both higher realized and expected real 
interest rates, creating furth er drags  on growth.2
The Federal Reserve’s policy target for  the federal funds rate has been near zero 
since December 2008, so an other  means of providing monetary accommodation ha s been 
necessary  since that time .  Accordingly, the FOMC purchase d Treasury  and agency -
backed  securities  on a large scale from December 2008 through March 2010, a policy 
that appears to have been quite successful in helping to stabiliz e the economy and support 
the recovery  during that period.  Following up on this  earlier success,  the Committee 
announced thi s month that it would purchase additional Treasury securities .  In taking 
that action, the Committee seeks to support the economic recovery, promote a faster pace of job creation, and reduce the risk of  a further decline in inflation that would prove  
damag ing to the recovery .   In light of the significant risks to the 
economic recovery, to the health of the labor market, and to price stability , the FOMC 
decid ed that additional policy support was warranted.   
Although securities purchase s are a  different  tool for conducting monetary policy 
than the  more familiar  approach of managing the overnight  interest rate , the goals and 
transmission mechanisms are very similar .  In particular, securities purchases by the 
central bank  affect the economy primarily by lowering interest rates on securities of 
longer maturities, just as conventional monetary policy , by affecting the expected path of 
short -term rates, also influences longer -term rates .  Lower long er-term rates  in turn lead 
                                                           
2 Unexpectedly  high realizations of re al interest rates increase the real burden of household and business 
debts, relative to what was anticipated when the debt contracts were signed.   Higher expected real interest 
rates deter capital investment and other forms of spending.  - 6 - 
 
 
 to more accommodative financial conditions, which support household and business 
spending.  As I noted, the evidence suggests that asset purchases can be an effective tool; indeed, financial conditions eased notably in anticipation of the Federal Reserve’s policy announcement.  
Incidentally, in my view, the use of the term “quantitative easing” to refer to  the 
Federal Reserve’s policies  is inappropriate.  Quantitative easing typically refers to 
policies that seek to have  effects by changing the quantity of bank reserves, a channel 
which seems relatively weak , at least in the U.S. context .  In contrast, securities 
purchases work by affecting the yields on the acquired securities and, via substitution effects in investors’ portfolios, on a wider range of assets . 
This policy tool will be used in a  manner that is  measured and responsive  to 
economic co nditions .  In particular, t he Committee stated that it would review its asset -
purchase program regularly in light of incoming information and would adjust the program as needed to meet its objectives.  Importantly, t he Committee remains 
unwaveringly  committed to price stability and does  not seek  inflation above the level of 2 
percent or a bit less that most FOMC participants  see as consistent with  the Federal 
Reserve’s mandate.  In that regard, it bears emphasizing  that the Federal Reserve has 
worked hard to ensure that it  will not have any problems exiting from this program at the 
appropriate time.  The Fed’s power  to pay interest on banks’  reserves  held at the Federal 
Reserve will allow it to manage short- term interest rates effectively  and thus to tighten 
policy when needed , even if bank reserves remain high.  Moreover, t he Fed has invested 
considerable effort in developing  tools that will allow it to  drain or immobilize bank 
reserves as needed to  facilitate the s mooth withdrawal of policy accommodation when - 7 - 
 
 
 conditions warrant.  If necessary, the Committee could also tighten policy by redeeming 
or selling securities.  
The foreign exchange value of the dollar has fluctuated considerably during the 
course of the crisis , driven by a range of factors .  A significant portion of these 
fluctuations has reflect ed changes in  investor risk aversion, with the dollar tending to 
appreciate when risk aversion is high.  In particular, much of the decline over the summer 
in the  foreign exchange value of the dollar  reflected an unwinding of  the increase in the 
dollar’s value  in the spring  associated with the European sovereign debt crisis.  The 
dollar’s role as a safe haven during  periods of market stress stems in no small part f rom 
the underlying strength and stability that the U.S. economy has exhibited over the years.  Fully aware of the important role that the dollar plays in the international monetary  and 
financial system, the Committee believes that the best way to continue to deliver the 
strong economic fundamentals that underpin the value of  the dollar , as well as to support 
the global recovery,  is through policies that lead to a resumption of  robust  growth in  a 
context of price stability in  the United States.  
In sum, on its current economic trajectory the United States runs the risk of seeing 
millions of workers unemployed or underemployed for many years.  As a society, we should find that outcome unacceptable.  Monetary policy is working in support of  both 
economic recovery and price stability, but there are limits to what can be a chieved by the 
central bank alone.  The Federal Reserve is nonpartisan and does not make recommendations regarding specific tax and spending programs.  However, in general terms, a fi scal program that combines near -term measures to enhance growth with strong, - 8 - 
 
 
 confidence -inducing steps to reduce longer -term structural deficits would be an important 
complement to the policies of the Federal Reserve.  
Global Policy Challenges and Tensions  
The two -speed nature of the global recovery implies that different policy stances 
are appropriate for different groups of countries.  As I have noted, advanced economies 
generally need accommodative policies  to sustain economic growth.  In the emerging 
market  economies , by contrast, strong growth and incipient concerns about inflation have 
led to somewhat tighter policies.  
Unfortunately, the differences in the cyclical positions and policy stances of the 
advanced and emerging market economies have intens ified the challenges for 
policymakers around the globe .  Notably, i n recent months, some officials in emerging 
market  economies  and elsewhere have argued that  accommodative monetary policies in 
the advanced economies , especially the United States , have bee n producing negative 
spillover effects on their economies .  In particular, they are concerned that advanced 
economy policies are inducing excessive capital inflows  to the  emerging market  
economies, inflows that  in turn put unwelcome upward pressure on emerging market  
currencies and threaten to create asset  price bubbles .  As is evident in figure  6, net private 
capital flows to a selection of  emerging market economies  (based on national balance of 
payments data) have rebounded from the large outflows experienced during  the worst of 
the crisis.  O verall, by this broad measure, such  inflows through the second quarter of this 
year were not any larger than in the year before the crisis , but they were nonetheless 
substantial.   A narrower but timelier measure of demand for emerging market assets --net 
inflows to equity  and bond funds investing in emerging markets, shown in figure  7--- 9 - 
 
 
 suggests  that inflows of capital to emerging ma rket economies  have indeed picked up in 
recent months .  
To a large degree, these capital flows have been driven by perceived return 
differentials  that favor emerging markets , resulting from factors such as stronger 
expected growth --both in the short term and in the longer run-- and higher interest rates , 
which reflect differences in policy settings as well as other forces .  As figures 6 and 7 
show, e ven before the crisis,  fast-growing emerging market economies  were attractive 
destination s for cross -border investment .  However,  beyond these fundamental factors, an 
important  driver  of the rapid capital inflows to some  emerging markets is incomplete 
adjustment of exchange rates in those economies, which leads investors to anticipate 
additional returns arising from expected exchang e rate appreciation . 
The exchange rate adjustment is incomplete, in part, because the  authorities in 
some emerging market economies  have intervened in foreign exchange markets to 
prevent or slow the appreciation of their currencies .  The degree of intervention  is 
illustrated for select ed emerging market economies in figure 8.  The vertical axis of this 
graph shows the percent change in the real effective exchange rate in the 12 months through September.  The horizontal axis shows the accumulation of  foreign exchange 
reserves as a share of GDP over the same period.  The relationship evident in the graph suggests that the economies that have most heavily intervened in foreign exchange markets have succeeded in limiting the appreciation of their currencies.   The graph also 
illustrates that some emerging market economies have interven ed at very high levels and 
others relatively little.  Judging from the changes in the real effective exchange rate, the emerging market economies that have largely let market  forces determine their exchange - 10 - 
 
 
 rates  have seen their competitiveness reduced relative to those emerging market  
economies  that have intervene d more aggressively.  
It is striking that, amid all the concerns about renewed private capital inflows  to 
the emerging market  economies , total capital, on net, is still flowing from relatively 
labor -abundant emerging  market economies to capit al-abundant advanced economies.  In 
particular, the current account deficit of the United States implies that it experience d net 
capital inflows exceeding 3 percent of GDP in the first half of this  year.  A key driver of  
this “uphill” flow of capital is o fficial reserve accumulation in the  emerging market  
economies  that exceeds private capital inflows  to these economies .  The t otal holdings of 
foreign exchange reserves by selected  major emerging market economies, shown in 
figure 9, have risen sharply since the crisis and now surpass  $5 trillion --about  six times 
their level a decade ago.  China holds about half of the total  reserves of these selected 
economies , slightly more than $2.6 trillion.  
It is instructive to c ontrast th is situation  with what would happen in a n 
international system in which exchange rates were allowed to fully reflect market 
fundamentals .  In the curre nt context, advanced economies would pursue accommodative 
monetary policies as needed to foster recovery and to guard against unwanted 
disinflation.  At the same time , emerging market economies  would tighten their own 
monetary polic ies to the degree needed to prevent overheating and inflation.  The 
result ing increase in emerging  market  interest rates relative to those in the advanced 
economies would naturally lead to increased capital flows from advanced to emerging economies  and, consequently, to cur rency appreciation in emerging market  economies.  
This currency appreciation would in turn tend to reduce  net exports and current account - 11 - 
 
 
 surpluses  in the emerging market s, thus  help ing cool these rapidly growing economies  
while adding to demand in the advanced economies .  Moreover, currency appreciation 
would help shift a greater proportion of domestic output toward satisfying domestic needs  
in emerging markets .  The net result would be more balanced and sustainable global 
economic growth.   
Given th ese ad vantages  of a system of market -determined  exchange rates , why 
have officials in  many emerging markets  leaned against appreciation  of their currencies 
toward  level s more consistent with market fundamentals?   The principal  answer is that 
currency undervaluation on the part of some countries  has been part of a  long -term 
export -led strategy for growth and development.  This strategy, which allows a country’s 
producers to operate at a greater scale and to produce a more diverse set of products than 
domestic demand alone might sustain, has been viewed as promot ing economic growth 
and, more broadly, as making an important contribution to the development of a number 
of countries.  However, increasingly over time , the strategy of currency undervaluation 
has demonstrated important drawbacks, both for the world system and for the countries 
using that strategy . 
First, as I have described , currency undervaluation  inhibits necessary 
macroeconomic adjustment s and creates challenges for policymakers in both advanced 
and emerging market economies .  Globally, both growth and trade are unbalanced , as 
reflected in the two -speed recovery and in persistent  current account surpluses and 
deficits .  Neither situation is  sustainable.  Because a  strong expansion in the emerging 
market economies will ultimately depend on a recovery in the more advanced economies, this pattern of two -speed growth  might very well be resolved in favor of slow growth for - 12 - 
 
 
 everyone  if the recover y in the advanced economies falls short.  Likewise, large and 
persistent imbalances in current accounts represent a growing financial and economic 
risk. 
Second, the current system leads to uneven burdens of adjustment among 
countries, with those countries that allow substantial flexibility in their exchange rates bearing the greatest burden  (for example, in having to make potentially large and rapid 
adjustments in the scale of export -oriented industries)  and those that  resist appreciation 
bearing the least.  
Third, c ountries that maintain undervalue d currencies  may themselves  face 
important costs  at the national level , including a reduced ability to use independent 
monetary polic ies to stabilize their economies  and the risk s associated with  excessive or 
volatile  capital inflows.   The latter can be managed to some extent  with a variety of tools, 
including  various forms of capital control s, but such approaches  can be difficult to 
implement or  lead to microeconomic distortions.  The high levels of reserv es associated 
with currency undervaluation may also imply significant fiscal costs if  the liabilities 
issued to sterilize reserves bear interest rates that exceed those on the reserve assets themselves.  Perhaps most important, the ultimate purpose of economic growth is to deliver higher living standards at home; thus, eventually , the benefits of  shifting 
productive resources  to satisfying domestic needs must  outweigh the development 
benefits of continued reliance on export -led growth.   
Improv ing the International System  
The current international monetary system is not working  as well as it should.  
Currency undervaluation by surplus countries is inhibiting needed international - 13 - 
 
 
 adjustment and creating spillover effects that would not exist if exchange rates better 
reflected market fundamentals.  In addition, differences in the degree of currency 
flexibility impose unequal burdens of adjustment, penalizing countries with relatively flexible exchange rates.  What should be done?  
The answer s differ depending on whether one is talking about the long term or the 
short term .  In the longer term, significantly greater flexibility in exchange rates  to reflect 
market forces  would be desirable and achievable.  That flexibility would help facilitate 
global r ebalancing and reduce the problem s of policy spillovers that emerging market  
economies  are confronting today.  The  further liberalization of exchange  rate and capital 
account regimes  would be most effective if it were accompanied by  complementary 
financial  and structural  policies to  help achieve better global balance in trade and capital 
flows.  For example, surplus countries could speed adjustment with policies that boost domestic spending, such as strengthening the social safety net, improving retail credit markets to encourage domestic consumption, or other structural reforms.  For their part, deficit countries need to do more over time to narrow the gap between investment and national saving.  In the United States, putting fiscal policy on a sustainable path is a 
critical step toward increasing national saving in the longer term.  Higher private saving would also help.  And resources will need to shift into the production of export - and 
import -competing goods.  Some of these shifts in spending and product ion are already 
occurring; for example,  China is taking steps to boost domestic demand and the U.S.  
personal saving rate has risen sharply since 2007.  
In the near term , a shift of the international regime toward one in which exchange 
rates respond flexibly  to market forces is , unfortunately, probably not practical  for all - 14 - 
 
 
 economies .  Some emerging market economies  do not have the infrastructure to support a 
fully convertible, internationally traded currency and to allow unrestricted capital flows.  
Moreover , the internal rebalancing associated with exchange rate appreciation --that is, 
the shifting of resources and productive capacity from production for ex ternal markets  to 
production for the domestic market --takes time.  
That said, in the short term, rebalancing  economic growth between the advanced 
and emerging market economies  should remain a common objective , as a two -speed 
global recovery  may not be  sustainable.  Appropriately accommodative policies in the 
advanced economies help  rather hinder this process .  But the rebalancing of growth 
would also be facilitated if fast- growing countries, especially those with large current 
account surpluses, would take action to reduce their surpluses, while slow -growing 
countries, especially those with large  curre nt account deficits, take parallel  action s to 
reduce th ose deficits.  Some  shift of demand from surplus to deficit countries , which 
could be compensated for if necessary by actions to strengthen domestic demand in th e 
surplus  countries , would accomplish tw o objectives.  First , it would be a down payment 
toward global rebalancing of trade and current accounts, an essential outcome for long -
run economic and financial stability.  Second, improving the trade balances of slow -
growing countries would help them gr ow more quickly, perhaps reducing the need for 
accommodative policies  in those countries  while enhancing the sustainability of the 
global recovery .  Unfortunately, so long as exchange  rate adjustment is incomplete  and 
global growth prospects are markedly uneven, the problem of excessively strong capital inflows to emerging markets may persist. 
Conclusion  - 15 - 
 
 
 As currently constituted, the international monetary system has a structural flaw :  
It lacks a mechanism, market  based or otherwise, to induce needed adjustments by 
surplus countries , which can result in persistent imbalance s.  This problem is not new.  
For example, in the somewhat different context of the gold standard in the period prior to 
the Great Depression, t he United States and France ran large current account surpluses, 
accompanied by  large inflows of gold.  However, in defiance of the so- called rules of the 
game of the international gold standard, neither country allowed the higher gold reserves to feed thr ough to their domestic money supplies and price levels, with the result that the 
real exchange rate in each country remained  persistently undervalued.  These policies 
created deflationary pressures in  deficit countries that were losing gold, which help ed 
bring on the Great Depression.
3  The gold standard was meant to ensure economic and 
financial stability, but failures of international coordination undermined these very goals.  Although the parallels are  certainly  far from perfect,  and I am certainly not  predicting a 
new Depression,  some  of the lessons from that grim period are applicable today .
4
Thus, it would be desirable for the global community, over time, to devise a n 
international monetary system that more consistently aligns the interests of individual   In 
particular, f or large, systemically important countries  with persistent current account 
surpluses , the pursuit of export -led growth cannot ultimately succeed  if the  implications 
of that strategy for global growth and stability are not taken into account.

 countries with the interests of the global economy as a whole.  In particular, such a 
system would provide more effective checks on the tendency for countries to run large and persistent external imbalan ces, whether  surpluses or deficits.  Changes to accomplish 
these goals  will take considerable time, effort, and coordination to implement.  In the 
meantime, without such a system in place, the countries of the world must recognize their collective responsi bility for bringing about the rebalancing required to preserve global 
economic stability and prosperity.  I hope that  policymakers  in all countries  can work 
together cooperatively to achieve a strong er, more sustainable, and more balanced global 
economy.

Town Hall Meeting with Educators  
 
Washington, D.C. 
       
September  30, 2010 
On behalf of my colleagues throughout the Federal Reserve System, I want to 
thank you for joining us today.  As educators, your work is critical to our economy  and 
our nation.  Well -prepared students make for a productive  and innovative  workforce and 
a well -functioning democracy.  
The economist Alfred M arshall said that economics is the  study of people  in the 
ordinary business of life.1  What could be more fundamental?   Learning about economics 
helps students understand how the decisions of millions of people about what to produce 
and consume determine what Adam Smith called “the wealth of nations” --our living 
standard s.2
I am sure that your students have been eager to understand the economic and 
financial events of the past few years.  T he recent financial crisis was among the most 
profound challenges to economic and financial stability  since the Great Depression , and 
its causes and its ultimate remedies have been, and will continue to be, widely debated.  The study of econom ics will allow your students to join the debate in a responsible and 
informed way.    In particular, economics helps students understand both the strengths and the 
shortcomings of our market -based economic system.   
One of the  key lessons of the recent financial crisis is the importance of personal 
financial literacy.  Many of you teach your students the skills  necessary to make good 
financial decisions .  Your efforts are of paramount importance in helping  students  
understand how to save for the future and how to invest their  money to make it grow.  In 
retrospect, s ome of the people who were hurt the most during the crisis borrowed mone y 
that they should not have borrowed and signed financial contracts they should not have

Brief remarks  
 
by 
 
Ben S. Bernanke  
 
Chairman  
 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  
 
at the 
 
Annual Conference of the Union of Arab Banks  
 
on the Occasion of its 40th Anniversary  
 
Beirut, Lebanon  
  
 
 
   
November 14, 2013  
(via prerecorded video )  
Good morning.  I am pleased to address the Annual Conference of the Union of 
Arab Banks (UAB) as it celebrates 40 years of success representing the interests of the 
Arab banking and financial communities.   
The UAB may justifiably take great pride in its many accomplishments during the 
past four decades.  Among other achievements, the UAB has emerged as a key 
international and regional parti cipant in developing policies that promote financial 
stability, economic integration, and sustainable development and prosperity.  The UAB has also been a champion of sharing best practices and training among regulators and bankers.  
The partnership that ha s developed between the Federal Reserve and the UAB 
may be counted among these successes.   Ten years ago, the Federal Reserve helped 
establish --with the support of many of the countries represented at this conference --the 
Middle East and North Africa (MENA ) Financial Regulators’ Initiative.  Sarkis 
Yoghourtdjian of the Federal Reserve Board, who is attending with you today, was asked to lead this i nitiative, whose aim has been to provide technical assistance and bank 
supervision training to central banks and bank supervisory authorities.  Now in its 10th  
and final year, the Financial Regulators’ Initiative has sponsored more than 40 training programs and conferences throughout the MENA region, and it has  provided many short -
term, on- the-job training opportunities for MENA regulators with U.S. banking agencies.  
We are grateful to the UAB for its many contributions to the success of this initiative.  
In addition to celebrating accomplishments, anniversaries also provide a time for 
reflection and self -assessment .  Governments, central bankers, financial regulators, and 
the banking industry still labor today in the long shadow cast by the global financial  - 2 - 
crisis.  Against that backdrop, financial regulators around the world are engaged in a 
historic and sweeping r enovation of the global financial structure.   
One of the most important goals is to ensure that banks hold more and higher -
quality capital, and have sufficient liquid assets on hand, to be able to survive a market shock or severe economic downturn.  In addition, we must push banking organizations of all sizes to ensure their compensation practices link pay to performance and do not encourage excessive risk -taking.  
Past and current crises underscore an additional lesson.  Then as  now, 
international or reg ional financial crises require a coordinated response to safeguard the 
stability of the world’s financial system.  To that end, the UAB can play an important regional role by facilitating efforts to address potential cross -border issues, and by 
providing a  local platform for strong cooperation between home and host supervisors 
during normal and crisis periods. 
At your conference this week, I anticipate you will discuss the opportunities and 
challenges that lay ahead for your members.  Among the topics , no doubt , will be the 
prospects for partnership between the public and private sectors, the importance of establishing institutions capable of managing crises, the effects  of new regulatory and 
supervisory structures on the banking industry, and the role of the banking sector in promoting economic growth. 
We at the Federal Reserve face similar challenges and opportunities, and we  look 
forward to working with you to  find common approaches and solutions.  I wish you a 
successful and productive conference.  Warm congratulations on your 40th  anniversary, 
and best wishes for another 40 years of success.  ",2013-11-14,bernanke

Labor Market Dynamics and Monetary Policy  
 
 
 
Remarks by  
 
Janet L. Yellen  
 
Chair  
 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  
 
at the 
 
Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Economic Symposium  
 
Jackson Hole, Wyoming  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
August  22, 2014 
  
In the five years since the end of the Great Recession, the economy has made 
considerable progress in recovering from the largest and most sustained loss of 
employment in the United States since the Great Depression.1  More jobs have now been 
created in the recovery than were lost in the downturn, with payroll employment in May 
of this year finally exceeding the previous peak in January 2008.  Job gains in 2014 have 
averaged 23 0,000 a month, up from the 190,000 a month pace during the preceding two 
years .  The unemployment rate, at 6.2 percent  in July, has declined nearly 4  percentage 
points from  its late 2009 peak.  Over the p ast year, the unemployment rate has fallen 
considerably, and at a surprisingly rapid pace.  These developments are encouraging, but 
it speaks to the depth of the damage that , five years after the end of the recession, the 
labor market has yet to fully recover.   
The Federal Reserve’s monetary polic y objective is to foster maximum 
employment and price stability .  In this regard, a key challenge is to assess just how far 
the economy now stands from the attainment of its maximum employment goal.  
Judgments concerning the size of that gap are complicate d by ongoing shifts in the 
structure of the labor market and the possibility that the severe recession caused 
persistent changes in the labor market’s functioning.     
These and other questions about the labor market are central to the conduct of 
monetary policy, so I am pleased that the organizers of this year’s symposium chose 
labor market dynamics as its theme.  My colleagues on the Federal Open Market 
Committee (FOMC) and I look to the presentations and discussions over  the next two 
days for  insights in to possible changes that are affecting the labor market .  I expect, 
                                                 
1 Nonfarm employment contracted by 6.3 percent from its peak in 2008 to its trough in early 2010, 
compared with a 5.2 percent loss in the 1948 -49 recession, previously the largest since the 1930s.   - 2 - 
however, that our understanding of labor market developments and their potential 
implications for inflation will remain far from perfect.  As a consequence, monetary 
policy ultimately must  be conducted in a pragmatic manner that relies not on any 
particular indicator or model, but instead reflects an ongoing assessment of a wide range 
of information in the context of our ever -evolving understanding of the economy .  
The Labor Market Recovery  and Monetary Policy  
In my remarks this morning, I will review a number of developments relat ed to 
the functioning of the labor market that have made it more difficult to judge the 
remaining degree of slack.  Differing interpretations of these developments  affect 
judgments concerning the appropriate path of monetary policy.  Before turning to the 
specifics, however, I  woul d like to provide some context concerning the role of the labor 
market in shaping monetary policy over the past several years.  During th at time, the 
FOMC has maintained a highly accommodative monetary policy in pursuit of its 
congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment a nd stable prices.  The 
Committee judged such a stance appropriate because infl ation has fallen short of our 
2 percent objective while the labor market, until recently, operated very far from any 
reasonable definition of  maximum employment.    
The FOMC’s current program of asset purchases began when the unemployment 
rate stood at 8.1 percent and progress in lowering i t was expected to be much slower than 
desired.  The Committee’s objective was to achieve a substantial improvement in the 
outlook for the labor market, and as progress toward this goal has materialized, we have 
reduced our pace of asset purchases and expec t to complete this program in October.  In 
addition, in December 2012, the Committee modified its forward guidance for the federal  - 3 - 
funds rate, stating that “as long as the unemployment rate remain s above 6 -1/2 percent, 
inflation between one and two years a head is projected to be no more than a half 
percentage point above the Committee’s  2 percent longer -run goal, and  longer -term 
inflation expectations continu e to be well  anchored, ” the Committee would not even 
consider raising the federal funds rate above t he 0 to 1/4 percent range.2  This “threshold  
based” forward guidance was deemed appropriate under conditions in which inflation 
was subdued and the economy remained unambiguously far from maximum employment.   
Earlier this year, however, with the unemployment rate declining faster than had 
been anticipated and nearing the 6 -1/2 percent threshold , the FOMC recast its forward 
guidance, stating that “in determining how long to maintain the current 0  to 1/4 percent 
target range for the federal funds ra te, the Committee would assess progress --both 
realized and expected --toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent 
inflation .”3  As the recovery progresses, assessments of the degree of remaining slack in 
the labor market need to become more nu anced because of considerable uncertainty  about 
the level of employment consistent with the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.  Indeed, in 
its 2012 statement on longer -run goals and monetary policy strategy, the FOMC 
explicitly recognized that factors determi ning maximum employment “may change over 
time and may not be directly measurable,” and that assessments of the level of maximum 
employment “are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision.”4  Accordingly, the

reformulated forward guidance reaffirms the F OMC’s view that policy decisions will not 
be based on any single indicator, but will instead take into account a wide  range of 
information on the labor market, as well as inflation and financial developments.5 
Interpreting Labor Market Surprises:  Past and  Future  
The assessment of labor market slack is rarely simple and has been especially 
challenging recently.  Estimates of slack necessitate difficult judgments about the 
magnitudes of the cyclical and structural influences affecting labor market variables,  
including labor force participation, the extent of part -time employment for economic 
reasons, and labor market flows, such as the pace of hires and quits.  A considerable body 
of research suggests that the behavior of these and other labor market variable s has 
changed since the Great Recession.6  Along with cyclical influences, significant structural 
factors have affected the labor market, including the aging of the workforce and other 
demographic trends, possible changes in the underlying degree of dynami sm in the labor  
market, and the phenomenon of “polarization” --that is, the reduction in the relative 
number of middle -skill jobs.7   
                                                 
5 The central role of labor market conditions in monetary policy deliberations has also been apparent 
abroad .  Last year the Bank of England announced its inte ntion not to raise its policy rate at least until the 
unemployment rate reached 7 percent,  subject to conditions on inflation and financial stability.  Since that 
time, the unemployment rate in the United Kingdom has dropped unexpectedly rapidly , prompting 
policymakers  to consider data beyond this single indicator when assessing the extent of spare capacity in 
the U.K. economy .  As in the United States, an unexpectedly swift decline in unemployment has raised 
questions about the structural and cy clical effects of a severe recession.  
6 For a discussion of important differences in the evolution of labor market conditions during the Great 
Recession relative to typical postwar patterns, see Henry S. Farber (2011), “Job Loss in the Great 
Recession:  Hi storical Perspective from the Displaced Workers Survey, 1984 -2010,” NBER Working Paper 
Series 17040 (Cambridge, Mass.:  National Bureau of Economic Research, May).  
7 For convenience, the analysis here is presented as if cyclical factors and structural fact ors can be neatly 
delineated.  In reality, the line between the two may be  indistinct.  Moreover, what begins as cyclical 
weakness may evolve into structural damage.  For a discussion of the strategic issues that arise when 
policymakers believe such evolut ion from cyclical to structural to be an important feature of the economy, 
see Dave Reifschneider, William Wascher, and David Wilcox (2013), “Aggregate Supply in the United 
States:  Recent Developments and Implications for the Conduct of Monetary Policy,” Finance and 
Economics Discussion Series 2013 -77 (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 
November), www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2013/201377/201377abs.html.   - 5 - 
Consider first the behavior of the labor force participation rate, which has 
declined substantially since the end of the recession even as the unemployment rate has 
fallen.  As a consequence, the employment -to-population ratio has increased far less over 
the past several years than the unemployment rate alone would indicate, based on past 
experience.  For policymakers, the key question is : What portion of the decline in labor 
force participation reflects structural shifts and what portion reflects cyclical weakness in 
the labor market ?  If the cyclical component is abnormally large, relative to the 
unemployment rate, then it might be seen as an additional contributor to labor market 
slack.    
Labor force participation peaked in early 2000, so its decline beg an well before 
the Great Recession.  A portion of that decline clearly relates to the aging of the baby 
boom generation.  But the pace of decline accelerated with the recession.  As an 
accounting matter, the drop in the participation rate since 2008 can be  attributed to 
increases in four factors:  retirement, disability, school enrollment, and other reasons, 
including worker discouragement.8  Of these, greater worker discouragement is most 
directly the result of a weak labor market, so we could reasonably e xpect further 
increases in labor demand to pull a sizable share of discouraged workers back into the 
workforce.   Indeed, the flattening out of  the labor force participation rate since late last 
year could partly reflect discouraged workers rejoining the la bor force in response to the 
significant improvements that we  have seen in labor market conditions.  If so, the cyclical 
shortfall in labor force partic ipation may have diminished .

What is more difficult to determine is whether some portion of the increase  in 
disability rates, retirements, and school enrollments since the Great Recession reflects 
cyclical forces.  While structural factors have clearly and importantly affected each of 
these three trends, some portion of the decline in labor force participati on resulting from 
these trends could be related to the recession and slow recovery and therefore might 
reverse  in a stronger labor market.9  Disability applications and educational enrollments 
typically are affected by cyclical factors, and existing eviden ce suggests that the elevated 
levels of both may partly reflect perceptions of poor  job prospects.10  Moreover, the rapid 
pace of retirements over the past few years might reflect some degree of pull -forward of 
future retirements in the face of a weak labor  market.  If so, retirements might contribute

less to declining participation in the period ahead than would otherwise be expected 
based on t he aging workforce.11     
A second factor bearing on estimates of labor market slack is the elevated number 
of workers who are employed part  time but  desire full -time work (those classified as 
“part time for economic reasons”).  At nearly 5 percent of the labor force, the number of 
such workers is notably larger, relative to the unemployment rate, than has been typ ical 
historically, providing another reason why the current level of  the unemployment rate 
may understate the amount of remaining slack  in the labor market.  Again, however, 
some portion of the rise in involuntary part -time work may reflect structural rath er than 
cyclical factors.  For example, the ongoing shift in employment away from  goods  
produc tion and toward services, a sector which historically ha s used a greater portion of 
part-time workers, may be boosting the share  of part -time jobs.  Likewise, the continuing 
decline of middle -skill jobs, some of which could be replaced by part -time jobs, may 
raise the share  of part -time jobs in overall employment.12  Despite these challenges in 
assessing where the share  of those emp loyed part time for economic reasons may settle in 
                                                 
11 The effects of the Great Recession on retirements are difficult to identify.  During the recession and 
immediately after, the losses in wealth may have put upward pressure on labor force par ticipation; the 
persistently weak labor market may have subsequently contributed to more retirements and thus put 
downward pressure on participation.  Perhaps as a result of these confounding forces, early research on the 
effects of the Great Recession on retirement finds unclear results.  For example, see Alan L. Gustman, 
Thomas L. Steinmeier, and Nahid Tabatabai (2011), “How Did the Recession of 2007 -2009 Affect the 
Wealth and Retirement of the Near Retirement Age Population in the Health and Retirement S tudy?”

the long run, the sharp run -up in involuntary part -time employment during the recession 
and its slow decline thereafter suggest that cyclical factors are significant.    
Private sector l abor market flows  provide additional indications of the strength of 
the labor market.  For example, the quit s rate has tended to be pro-cyclical, since more 
workers voluntarily quit their jobs when they are more confident about their ability to 
find new ones and when firms a re competing more actively for new hires.  Indeed, the 
quits rate has picked up with improvements in the labor market over the past year, but it 
still remains somewhat depressed relative to its level before the recession .  A significant 
increase in job ope nings over the past year suggests notable improvement in labor market 
conditions, but the hiring rate has only partially recovered from its decline during the 
recession.  Given the rise in job vacancies, hiring may be poised to pick up, but the 
failure of hiring to rise with vacancies could also indicate that firms perceive the 
prospects for economic growth as still insufficient to justify adding to payrolls.  
Alternatively, subdued hiring could indicate that firms are encountering difficulties in 
finding q ualified job applicants.  As is true of the other indicators I  have discussed, labor 
market flows tend to reflect not only cyclical but also structural changes in the economy.  
Indeed, these flows may provide evidence of reduced labor market dynamism, whic h 
could prove quite persistent .13  That said, the balance of evidence leads me to conclude 
                                                 
13 For an analysis documenting declines in the rates of hiring, layoffs, and quits, along with lower job 
creation and destruction, see Steven J. Davis, R. Jason Faberman, and John Haltiwanger (2012), “Labor 
Market Flows in the Cross Section and over Time,” Journal of Monetary Economics , vol. 59 (January), 
pp. 1-18.  For a review of a range of evidence and possible explanations, see Henry R. Hyatt and James R. 
Spletzer (2013), “The Recent Decline in Employment Dynamics,” IZA Discussion Paper Series 7231 
(Bonn, Germany:  Institute for the Study of Labor (IZA), February), http://ftp.iza.org/dp7231.pdf.  These 
authors suggest that much additional work is needed to understand the role of different factors in changes in 
labor market dynamism.  For an analysis that ra ises the possibility that some of these shifts reflect better 
job matches, see Raven Molloy, Christopher L. Smith, and Abigail K. Wozniak (2014), “Declining 
Migration within the U.S.:  The Role of the Labor Market,” NBER Working Paper Series 20065

that weak aggregate demand has contributed significantly to the depressed levels of quits 
and hires during the recession and in the recovery.   
One convenient way to summarize the information contained in a large number  of 
indicators is through the use of so -called factor models.  Following this methodology, 
Federal Reserve Board staff developed a labor market conditions index from 19 labor 
market indicators, including  four I just discussed.14  This broadly based metric supports 
the conclusion that the labor market has improved significantly over the past year, but it 
also suggests that the decline in the unemployment rate over this period somewhat 
overstates the improve ment in overall labor market conditions.   
Finally, changes in labor compensation may also help shed light on the degree of 
labor market slack, although here , too, there are significant challenges in distinguishing 
between cyclical and structural influence s.  Over the past several years, wage inflation, as 
measured by several different indexes, has averaged about 2 percent , and there  has been 
little evidence of any broad -based acceleration in either wages or compensation.  Indeed, 
in real terms, wages have been about flat, growing less than labor productivity.  This 
pattern of subdued real wage gains suggests that nominal compensation could rise more 
quickly without exerting any meaningful upward pressure on inflation.  And, since wage 
movements have histori cally been sensitive to tightness in the labor market, the recent 
                                                 
14 Among the indicators in the “labor market conditions index” are the labor force participation rate, 
workers classified as part time for economic reasons, hires, and quits.  The index does not incl ude the 
JOLTS job openings series but instead uses the Board staff’s composite help -wanted index, which has a 
longer history; the two measures generally track each other closely.  See Hess Chung, Bruce Fallick,

behavior of both nominal and real wages point to weaker labor market conditions than 
would be indicated by the current unemployment rate.   
There are three reasons, however, why we should be cautious in drawing such a 
conclusion.  First, the sluggish pace of nominal and real  wage growth in recent years may 
reflect the phenomenon of “ pent-up wage deflation. ”15  The evidence suggests that many 
firms faced significant constraints in lowering comp ensation during the recession and the 
earlier part of the recovery because of  “downward nominal wage rigidity” --namely, an 
inability or unwillingness on the part of firms to cut nominal wages.  To the extent that 
firms faced limits in reducing  real and nom inal wages when the labor market was 
exceptionally weak, they may find that now they do not need to raise wages to attract 
qualified workers.  As a result, wages might rise relatively slowly as the labor market 
strengthens.  If pent -up wage deflation is ho lding down wage growth, the current very 
moderate wage growth could be a misleading signal of the degree of remaining slack.  
Further, wages could begin to rise at a noticeably more rapid pace once pent -up wage 
deflation has been absorbed .  
Second, wage de velopments reflect not only cyclical but also secular trends that 
have likely affected the evolution of labor’s share of income in recent years.  As I noted, 
real wages have been rising less rapidly than productivity, implying that real unit labor 
costs ha ve been declining, a pattern suggesting that there is scope for nominal wages to 
accelerate from their recent pace without creating meaningful inflationary pressure.  
However, research suggests that the decline in real unit labor costs may partly reflect

secular factors that predate the recession, including changing patterns of production and 
international trade, as well as measurement issues.16  If so, productivity growth  could 
continue to  outpace real wage gains even when the economy is again operating at its 
potential.  
A third issue that complicates the interpretation of wage trends is the possibility 
that, because of  the dislocations of the Great Recession, transitory wage and price 
pressures could emerge well before maximum sustainable employment has been reached , 
although they would abate over time as the economy moves back toward maximum 
employment.17  The argument is that workers who have suffered long -term 
unemployment --along  with, perhaps, those who have dropped out of the labor force but 
would return to work in a stronger economy --face significant impediments to 
reemployment.  In this case, further improvement in the labor market could entail 
stronger wage pressures for a time before  maximum employment has been attained.18

empirical literature on the New -Keynesian Phillips Curve (for example, see Jordi Galí and Mark Gertler 
(1999), “Inflation Dynamics:  A Structural Econometric Analysis,” Journal of Monetary Economics , vol. 
44 (October), pp. 195 -222), and the connections (or lack thereof) between the labor share and traditional 
measures of slack (in the statistical sense) were highlighted in, among others, Michael T. Kiley (2007), “A 
Quantitative Comparison of Sticky -Price and Sticky -Information Models of Price Setting,” Journal of 
Money, Credit and Banking , vol. 39 (February), pp. 101 -25; and Michael T. Kiley (2013), “Output Gaps,” 
Journal of Macroeconomics , vol. 37 (September), pp. 1 -18.  Moreover, recent research has highlighted the 
challenges that swings in the labor share have presented for the interpretation of inflation developments (for 
example, Marco Del Negro, Marc P. Giannoni, and Frank Schorfheide (2014), “Inflation in the Great 
Recession and New Keynesian Mod els,” NBER Working Paper Series 20055 (Cambridge, Mass.:  National

Implications of Labor Market Developments for Monetary Policy  
The focus of my remarks to this point has been on the functioning of the labor 
market and how cyclical and structural influences have complicated the task of 
determining the state of the economy relative to the FOMC’s objective of maximum 
employment.  In my remaining time, I will turn to the special challenges that these 
difficulties in assessing the labor market pose for evaluating the appropriate stance o f 
monetary policy.   
Any discussion of appropriate monetary policy must be framed by the Federal 
Reserve’s dual mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.  For much 
of the past five years, the FOMC has been confronted with an obvious and su bstantial 
degree of slack in the labor market and significant risks of slipping into persistent below -
target inflation.  In such circumstances, the need for extraordinary accommodation is 
unambiguous, in my view.  
However, w ith the economy getting closer to  our objectives, the FOMC’s 
emphasis is naturally shifting to questions about the degree of remaining slack, how 
                                                 
(2013), “The P hillips Curve Is Alive and Well:  Inflation and the NAIRU during the Slow Recovery,” 
NBER Working Paper Series 19390 (Cambridge, Mass.:  National Bureau of Economic Research, August).  
For research highlighting potential alternative interpretations, see Mi chael T. Kiley (2014), “An Evaluation 
of the Inflationary Pressure Associated with Short - and Long -Term Unemployment,” Finance and 
Economics Discussion Series 2014 -28 (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 
March), www.federalreserv e.gov/pubs/feds/2014/201428/201428pap.pdf; and Christopher Smith (2014),

state-level -relationships -20140602.html . 
     The interaction of labor force participation and inflationary pressures has been understudied, in part 
because the strong trend s in participation due to demographic factors have implied that it is difficult to 
identify the cyclical component.  For an important example of a study demonstrating, within the core 
macroeconomic framework widely used in research, that movements in parti cipation should be considered 
in models of wage and price determination, see Christopher J. Erceg and Andrew T. Levin (2013), “Labor 
Force Participation and Monetary Policy in the Wake of the Great Recession,” IMF Working Paper 
WP/13/245 (Washington:  Inte rnational Monetary Fund, July), 
www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2013/wp13245.pdf.   - 13 - 
quickly that slack is likely to be taken up, and thereby to the question of under what 
conditions we should begin dialing back our extraordinar y accommodation.  As should be 
evident from my remarks so far, I believe that our assessments of the degree of slack 
must be based on a wide range of variables and will require difficult judgments about the 
cyclical and structural influences in the labor m arket.  While these assessments have 
always been imprecise and subject to revision, the task has become especially 
challenging in the aftermath of the Great Recession, which brought nearly unprecedented 
cyclical dislocations and may have been associated wi th similarly unprecedented 
structural changes  in the labor market --changes that have yet to be fully understood.   
So, what is a monetary policymaker to do?  Some have argued that , in light of the 
uncertainties associated with estimating labor market slack , policymakers should focus 
mainly on inflation developments in determining appropriate policy.  To take an extreme 
case, if labor market slack was the dominant and predictable driver of inflation, we could 
largely ignore labor market indicators and look i nstead at the behavior of inflation to 
determine the extent of slack in the labor market.  In present circumstances, with  inflation 
still running below the FOMC’s  2 percent objective, such an approach would suggest that 
we could maintain policy accommodati on until inflation is clearly moving back toward 2 
percent, at which point we could also be confident that slack had diminished.   
Of course, our task is not nearly so straightforward.  Historically, slack has 
accounted for only a small portion of the fluc tuations in inflation.  Indeed, unusual 
aspects of the current recovery may have shifted the lead -lag relationship between a 
tightening labor market and rising inflation pressures in either direction.  For example, as 
I discussed earlier, if downward nomin al wage rigidities created a stock of pent -up wage  - 14 - 
deflation during the economic downturn, observed wage and price pressures associated 
with a given amount of slack or pace of reduction in slack might be unusually low for a 
time.  If so, the first clear si gns of inflation pressure could come later than usual in the 
progression toward maximum employment.  As a result, maintaining a high degree of 
monetary policy accommodation until inflation pressures emerge could , in this case , 
unduly delay the removal of a ccommodation, necessitating an abrupt and potentially 
disruptive tightening of policy later on.   
Conversely, profound dislocations in the labor market in recent years --such as 
depressed participation associated with worker discouragement and a still -subst antial 
level of long -term unemployment --may cause inflation pressures to arise earlier than  
usual as the degree of slack in the labor market declines.  However, some of the resulting 
wage and price pressures could subsequently ease as higher real wages dra w workers 
back into the labor force and lower long -term unemployment.19  As a consequence, 
tightening monetary policy as soon as inflation moves back toward  2 percent might, in 
this case, prevent  labor markets from recovering fully and so would not be consi stent 
with the dual mandate.  
Inferring the degree of resource utilization from real -time readings on inflation is 
further complicated by the familiar challenge of distinguishing transitory price changes 
from persistent price pressures.  Indeed, the recent firming of inflation toward our 
2 percent goal appears to reflect a combination of both factors.          
These complexities in evaluating the relationship between slack and inflation 
pressures in the current recovery are illustrative of a host of issues that the FOMC will be 
                                                 
19 See Rudebusch and Williams, “A Wedge in the Dual Mandate,” in note 17.  - 15 - 
grappling with as the recovery continues.  There is no simple recipe for appropriate 
policy in this context, and the FOMC is particularly attentive to the need to clearly 
describe the policy framework we are using to meet these challen ges.  As the FOMC has 
noted in its recent policy statements, the stance of policy will be guided by our 
assessments of how far we are from our objectives of m aximum employment and 
2 percent inflation as well as our assessment of the likely pace of progress  toward those 
objectives.   
At the FOMC’s most recent meeting, the Committee judged, based on a range of 
labor market indicators, that “labor market conditions improved .”20  Indeed, as I noted 
earlier, they  have improved more rapidly than the Committee had anticipated.  
Nevertheless, the Committee judged that underutilization of labor resources still remains 
significant.  Given this assessment and the Committee’s expectation that inflation will 
gradually move u p toward its longer -run objective, the Committee reaffirmed its view 
“that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds 
rate for a considerable time after our current asset purchase program ends, especially if 
projected inflation continues to run below the Committee ’s 2 percent longer -run goal, and 
provided that longer -term inflation expectations remain well anchored .”21  But if progress 
in the labor market continues to be more rapid than anticipated  by the Committ ee or if 
inflation moves up more rapidly than anticipated, resulting in faster convergence toward 
our dual objectives, then increases in the federal funds rate target could come sooner than 
the Committee currently expects and could be more rapid thereafter .  Of course, if 
                                                 
20 See paragraph 1 of Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2014), “Federal Reserve Issues  
FOMC Statement,” press release, July 30, 
www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20140730a.htm . 
21 See paragraph 5 in Board of Governors, “FOMC Statement” (July 2014), in note 2 0.  - 16 - 
economic performance turns out to be disappointing  and progress toward our goals 
proceeds more slowly than we expect , then the future path of interest rates likely would 
be more accommodative than we currently anticipate .  As I have noted many times, 
monetary policy is not on a preset path.  The Committee will be closely monitoring 
incoming information on the labor market and inflation in determining the appropriate 
stance of monetary policy.  
Overall, I suspect that many of the labor marke t issues you  will be discussing at 
this conference will be at the center of FOMC discussions for some time to come.  I thank 
you in advance for the insights you  will offer  and encourage you to continue the 
important research  that advances our understanding  of cyclical and structural labor 
market issues.  ",2014-08-22,yellen

 Thank  you, Lorie, it is great to be here, and to hear the broad range of 
perspectives that are represented here today.  In 2019, during a very different time  in our 
history , the Federal Reserve began a year of listening sessions with the public, tied to 
changes being considered  in our approach to monetary policy , which was:  how the 
Federal Open Market Committee uses interest rate s and other tools to promote a  healthy 
economy.   While data can tell us a lot, hearing the stories behind that data helps to paint a 
picture that brings it to life for me and for my colleagues.   We have heard a lot about how 
Americans  are faring in the economy, and about how they are a ffected by our policy 
decisions. And so, our effort to create opportunities to enhance our ability to  listen has 
continued, and has become what I expect will be, and certainly should be,  a permanent 
feature of the Federal Reserve’s decisi on-making.    
It is a simple fact that what the Fed does in Washington has a significant impact 
on how families and businesses spend , borrow and plan for the future.  That is exactly 
why we need to learn about the experiences of  people in Odessa , Midland  and other 
communities in the Permian Basin.  Lately, as you know, the Fed has been focused on 
lowering inflation, which is essential if we want to support a  growing economy and rising 
incomes.  We want to hear how inflation , along with the higher interest  rates needed to 
bring inflation down,  is affecting you and your communities .  These conversations 
provide important context to the economic data that we consider, and they help guide our 
thinking about how we can best achieve stability and support for the  economic well -being 
of all American s.   
One of the important issues we will talk about today is workforce development, 
which in every  community depends on effective partnerships with the private sector.  For  
 - 2 - 
many years, t his region has been challenged to  find qualified workers in certain 
industries .  But now, the challenge of finding willing and qualified workers stretches far 
beyond just those requiring specific skills training .  Our strong labor market has made it 
extremely difficult for  growing business es to find workers, which, if not addressed, could  
eventually undermine a strong economy.  I am very interested to learn about the different 
strategies and approaches being used in this region to provide  workers with the skills  they 
need to fill these jobs, and what additional considerations might be helpful in your efforts 
to improv e workforce development.  
Another issue we will focus on today  is education.  As a mother of two middle 
school students during the depths of the pandemic, I am particularly inter ested in 
understanding how your communities have managed and continue to manag e 
Kindergarten through 12th grade  education after the disruptions many places experienced 
as a result of  the pandemic  school closures .   
Student performance suffers during even brief periods of instruction disruption.  
So even in places where school closures may have been limited, there may continue to be 
lasting effects on attendance and student performance.  Where  schools  were permitted to  
remain  open, we know that teacher  and support staff shortages were , and continue to be , a 
significant challenge for many school districts.   I look forward to hearing your views and 
experiences during our time together.  
Thank you, again, for the invitation to be here today , and I look forw ard to our 
discussions .

“Monetary Policy  Implementation and Transmission in the Post -Crisis Period ,”  
a research conference sponsored by  
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System

November 12, 2015 
  
It is my pleasure to welcome you to the Federal Reserve Board’s conference on 
“Monetary Policy Implementation  and Transmission in the Post -Crisis Period.”  The 
conference aims to bring together academic and central bank economists, financial 
market practitioners, and policymakers to stimulate debate and research on a topic that is critically important to the Fede ral Reserve’s mission of conducting monetary policy in  
the pursuit of maximum employment and stable prices.  
The global financial crisis had profound effects on our economy,  and it altered the 
way many think about monetary policy.  At the peak of the crisi s and during its 
immediate aftermath, unconventional monetary policy measures were designed and implemented by the Federal Reserve and other central banks around the world.  The post -
crisis period has offered policymakers an opportunity to assess a range of novel policy 
and operational issues associated with the conduct of monetary policy and the 
effectiveness of different policy options.  Specifically, policymakers have to carefully 
weigh the advantages and disadvantages of alternative monetary implementat ion 
frameworks in the presence of new policy tools.  Moreover, policymakers should be 
mindful of new channels for monetary policy transmission that may have emerged from 
the intricate economic and financial linkages in our global economy that were revealed  
by the crisis.  Finally, it is crucial to understand the effect  of regulations and possible 
changes in financial intermediation on monetary policy implementation and transmission.  
The impressive conference program covers the  following topics in three sess ions:  
monetary policy implementation,  the transmission of monetary policy , and the effect of 
regulation and financial intermediation on monetary policy implementation and transmission .  The presentations and discussions of the 12 academic papers on the  - 2 - 
conference program will surely provide a foundation for what I expect will be a 
stimulating discussion of important topics over the next two days.  
Looking ahead to later today, I am delighted that Vice Chairman Fischer will 
deliver keynote remarks on the exchange rate mechanism in the transmission of monetary 
policy.  Tomorrow the conference concludes with two interesting policy panels on the 
effect  of regulations on monetary policy and the “optimal design” of monetary policy in 
the post-crisis world.  
Let me also say that I consider the topics covered during this conference highly 
relevant for the Federal Reserve System’s ongoing efforts to evaluate potential long -run 
monetary policy implementation frameworks and to assess a number of  issues related to 
the consideration of alternative frameworks.  I hope the work and ideas presented and discussed over the next two days will spur subsequent research on these issues and 
promote further collaboration among all of you.  
As I have often str essed before, in addition to its responsibilities for monetary 
policy and financial regulation and supervision, the Federal Reserve takes very seriously 
its role as a research institution.  I want to thank our research conference committee for 
putting toge ther this high-caliber research conference, which has gathered distinguished 
speakers and guests from around the world and , I am sure , will add to our understanding 
of the implementation and transmission of monetary policy.   
Welcome to the Federal Reserve Board.  I hope you all have enjoyable and 
productive discussions over the next two days.  ",2015-11-12,yellen

Community Banking in the 21st  Century   
Fifth Annual Community Banking Research and Policy Conference

I am very glad to welcome everyone here to this conference  sponsored by the 
Federal Reserve System and  the Conference of State Bank Supervisors.  Since the first of 
these gatherings five years ago, th is research and policy c onference has established itself 
as an important event where industry l eaders, academics , and supervisors  discuss the 
latest research and exchange ideas about promoting a healthy and growing community 
banking industry. 
All of us share an interest in seeing that community banks continue their vital role 
in their customers’  lives and in a strong and stable U.S. financial system.  T he Fed has 
been  working hard to ensure that its  regulation and supervision of banks are  tailored 
appropriately to the size, complexity , and role different institutions play in the financial 
system.  F or co mmunity banks, which by and large avoided the risky business practices 
that contributed to the financial crisis,  we have been focused on making sure that much -
needed improvements to regulation and supervision since the crisis are appropriate and 
not unduly burdensome.  
One way we are doing this is through the  regulatory review requir ed by the 
Economic Growth and Regulatory  Paperwork Reduction Act, known as EGRPRA.  The 
first step we took, pursuant to EGRPRA, was  to listen to industr y and others with a stake 
in how community banks are supervised, which was accomplished t hrough soliciting 
written comments  and by holding  six outreach meetings in  2014 and  2015.  Our 
EGRPRA report, issued in March, was focused on community banks, and it  noted steps  
that had al ready taken place,  for example, to simplify Call R eport requirements and 
expand the number of firms eligible for less  frequent examinations.  Since that report, t he 
Board of Governors , along with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporat ion and the  - 2 - 
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,  has proposed a rule expanding the number of 
commercial real estate transactions that will no longer require an appraisal, allowing for a 
less detailed evaluation.  A nd just la st week, the Fed,  along wi th other regulators, took a 
significant step to reduce the regulatory burden on community banks and other smaller 
and less complex institutions by proposing to simplify several requirements in the 
regulatory capital rule.    
 We have done this because we  have an abiding commitment to consider how our 
decisions affect  institutions and the customers they serve.  We are well aware that 
community banks serve communities , businesses, and households that are often 
underserved by larger institutions and offer mo re extensive and m ore personalized  
services than  are often otherwise available.  We know that community bankers are part of 
the communities they serve, and they are often better able to understand the needs and the 
aspirations of their customers.  
We hope t hat the research presented at this conference stimulate s discussion about 
the leading policy issues facing the industry and supervisors.  As in the past, I see that 
this year’s agenda includes presentations related to several important issues , including the 
effect of supervision on risk- tasking and the effects of greater competition on community 
banks.  I am cheered to see that finance students at the University of Akron remain 
interested enough in community banking to participate in a case -study competitio n 
related to community banking, and I am pleased that the conference will hear a 
presentation of the winning case study.   - 3 - 
In closing, let me thank the conference organizers  with the Fed and the 
Conference of State Bank Supervisors , the scholars and others m aking presentations, and 
all of you for attending.  I hope you have a terrific conference.  ",2017-10-04,yellen

From Adding Accommodation to Scaling It Back

I am pleased to join you today to discuss the U.S. economy and the Federal 
Reserve’s monetary policy.  I strongly  believe that  my colleagues and I  should expl ain, as 
clearly as we can , both the reasons for our decisions and the fundamental  principles that 
underlie our strategy.   
Today I will review the conduct of monetary policy during the nearly 10 years 
since the onset of the financial crisis.  Although the Federal Reserve’s policy strategy for 
systematically pursuing its congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability ha s not changed during this period, the Federal Open Market 
Committee ( FOMC ) has made s ignificant tactical adjustments along the way.  I will 
spend most of my time today discussing the rationale for the adjustments the Committee 
has made sin ce 2014, a year that I see as a turning point , when the FOMC began to 
transition from providing increasing amounts of accommodation to gradually scaling it 
back.   
The process of scaling back accommodation has so  far proceeded at a slower pace 
than most FO MC participants anticipated in 2014 .  Both unexpected economic 
developments and deeper reevaluations of structural trends affecting the U.S. and global economies prompted us to reassess our  views on the outlook and associated risks and, 
consequently, the a ppropriate stance of monetary policy, both in the near term and the 
longer run.  Looking ahead, we continue to expect the evolution of the economy to 
warrant further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate .  However, 
given how clos e we are to meeting our statutory goals, and in the absence of new 
developments that might material ly worsen the economic outlook, the process of scaling 
back accommodation likely will not be as slow  as it was in 2015 and 2016.  - 2 - 
I should note that I will di scuss the process of scaling back accommodation 
mostly from the perspective of our interest rate decisions, which my FOMC colleagues 
and I see as our primary tool for actively adjusting the stance of monetary policy when our actions are not constrained by the zero lower bound on short -term interest rates.
1 
Assessing the Degree of Monetary Policy Accommodation  
In our monetary policy deliberations, the FOMC  always face s two fundamental 
questions:  First, how do we  assess the current stance of monetary policy?  Second, what 
are the strategic and tactical considerations that underpin our decisions about the appropriate  stance of monetary policy  going forward ?  These questions are difficult 
because t he interactions between monetary polic y and the economy are complex .  Policy 
affects the economy through many different channels, and, in turn, many factors 
influence the appropriate course of policy.   
Gauging the current stance of monetary policy requires arriving at a judgment of 
what would constitute a neutral policy stance at a given time .  A useful concept in this 
regard is the neutral “real” federal funds rate , defined as the level of the federal funds rate 
that, when adjusted for inflation, is neither expansionary nor contractionary whe n the 
economy is operating near its potential.  In effect, a “neutral” policy stance is one where 
monetary policy neither has its foot on the brake nor is pressing down on the accelerator.  
Although the concept of the neutral real federal funds rate is exceptionally useful in assessing policy, it is difficult in practical terms to know with precision where that rate 
                                                 
1 When the federal funds rate w as near zero and we felt the economy still needed more support, the FOMC 
acted, beginning in 2008, to purchas e longer -term securities.  Although we stopped increasing the size of 
our securities portfolio in 2014, we have been reinvesting principal payments f rom our securities holdings 
ever since.  We have said that we expect to maintain this policy until normalization of the level of the 
federal funds rate is well under way.  We have also said that, when it becomes appropriate to reduce the 
size of our balance sheet, we will do so primarily by letting maturing assets run off our balance sheet.   - 3 - 
stands.  As a result, and as I described in a recent speech , my colleagues and I consider a 
wide range of information when assessing that rate.2  As I will discuss, our assessments 
of the neutral rate have significantly shifted down over the past few years.   
In the Committee’s most recent projections last December, most FOMC 
participants assessed the longer -run value of the neutral real federal funds rate to be in 
the vicinity of 1 percent.3  This level is quite low by historical standards, reflecting, in 
part, slow productivity growth and an aging population not only in the United States, but 
also in many advanced economies.  Moreover, the curre nt value of the neutral real 
federal funds rate appears to be even lower than this longer -run value because of several 
additional headwinds to the U.S. economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis, such as subdued economic growth abroad and perhaps a l ingering sense of caution on the part of 
households and businesses in the wake of the trauma of the Great Recession.   
It is difficult to say just how low the current neutral rate is because assessments of 
the effect of post -recession headwinds on the curr ent level of the neutral real rate are 
subject to a great deal of uncertainty.  S ome recent estimates of the current value of the 
neutral real federal funds rate stand close to zero percent.
4  With the actual value of the 
real federal funds rate currently near minus 1 percent, a near -zero estimate of the neutral 
real rate means that the stance of monetary policy remains  moderately accommodative , 
an assessment that is consistent with the fact that employment has been growing at a pace-- around 180,000 net new  jobs per month--that is notably above the level estimated 
                                                 
2 See Yellen (2017).   
3 This estimate of the neutral real federal funds rate is based on the difference between the medians of the 
longer -run projections for the federal funds rate and inflation submitted by individual FOMC participants 
for the December 2016 FOMC meeting.  The m ost recent Summary of Economic Projections, an addendum 
to the minutes of that meeting, is available on the Board’s website at 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypo licy/fomcminutes20161214ep.htm .

to be consistent with the longer -run trend in labor force growth--between 75,000 and 
125,000 per month.5  As I will explain, this policy stance seems appropriate given that 
the underlying trend in inflation appears to be still running somewhat below 2 percent.  
But as that gap closes, with labor market conditions now in the vicinity of our maximum 
employment objective, the Committee considers it appropriate to move toward a neutral policy stance. 
My colleagues and I generally anticipate that the neutral real federal funds rate 
will rise to its longer -run level over the next few years .  This expectation partly underlies 
our view that gradual increases in the federal funds rate will likely be appropriate in the months and years ahead :  Those increases would keep the economy from significantly 
overheating, thereby sustaining the expansion and maintaining price stability . 
Post-Crisis Period: Same Strategy, New Tactics    
I will now examine the str ategic and tactical considerations that go into FOMC 
deliberations by discussing past monetary policy decisions in the context of  our mandate 
from the Congress to pursue maximum employment and price stability.  
The FOMC’s monetary policy strategy is based o n three basic principles.  First, 
our monetary policy must be goal driven.  We must take care to ensure that our decisions over time are consistent with our commitment to achieve the Federal Reserve’s 
congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment an d price stability, and that the 
public understands and has confidence in that commitment .  Second, our monetary policy 
must be forward looking because our decisions tend to influence economic activity and 
                                                 
5 The estimate of the actual value of the real federal funds rate (around minus 1 percent) is based on the 
difference between the current value of the effective federal funds rate (close to 0.66 percent) and the latest 
reading on inflation as measured by the 12 -month change in the price index for personal consumption 
expenditures excluding energy and food items (1 -3/4 percent).   - 5 - 
inflation with a substantial lag.  Among other thin gs, this implies looking through short -
term and transitory developments and focusing on the medium -term outlook--roughly 
two or three years out --when making policy decisions.  Third, our monetary policy must 
be risk sensitive.  Because the outlook is uncer tain, we must assess appropriate policy 
with an eye to ward  the risk that our expectations about the economy turn out to be 
significantly wrong .   
We have followed this basic strategy for decades  and, in 2012, the FOMC  
formal ized it in our “Statement on Lon ger-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.”6  
The Committee has reaffirmed this commitment annually.  But the challenges brought 
about by the financial crisis, and the very deep recession and painfully slow recovery that followed, compelled us to adjust our tactics for carrying out our policy strategy.  In particular, once the Committee had cut the federal funds rate to near zero in late 2008, it became necessary to deploy new tools to supply the considerable monetary accommodation required by the extremel y weak state of the job market and persistently 
low inflation.
7  Those tools --especially our large- scale securities  purchases and 
increasingly explicit forward guidance  pertaining to the likely future path of the federal 
funds rate --enabled  the Federal Res erve to provide necessary additional support to the 
U.S. economy by pushing down longer -term interest rates and easing financial conditions 
more generally.  
Much has been written and said already about the provision of additional 
accommodation between 2008 and 2014, when the FOMC completed its latest round of

large- scale securities  purchases , so I will turn now to our policy stance since 2014, when 
the FOMC’s main focus started to shift from providing additional accommodation to 
scaling it back.8  
2014: A Turning Point for  Monetary Policy  
By late 2013, the FOMC concluded that the economy had made sufficient 
progress, and the outlook was sufficiently favorable, that it should reduce the pace of its large- scale securities purchases.  But we reiterated that these purchases would continue 
until the outlook for the labor market had improved substantially.  T he U.S. economy 
made notable progress toward the FOMC’s stat utory goals  during 2014, with t he 
unemployment rate dropping  to close to 6 percent  by mid -year--well below its Great-
Recession peak of 10 percent --and other measures of labor market conditions also 
showing improvement :  Payroll gains were  solid ; job openings had risen significantly; 
and the number of workers voluntarily quitting their jobs --a sign of confidence in the 
labor market --was rising back toward pre -crisis levels.   We were also seeing progress on 
achieving our price stability goal:  Total inflation  as measured by changes in the headline 
personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index reach ed about  1-3/4 percent by 
mid-2014 after hovering around 1 percent in the fall of 2013.  Inflation seemed to be 
moving toward the FOMC’s 2 percent objective, a  level that the FOMC judges to be 
consistent with price stability because it is low enough that it does  not need to figure 
prominently into people ’s and businesses ’ economic decisions  but high enough to serve 
as a buffer against deflation and provide great er scope for monetary policy to address 
economic weakness.   
                                                 
8 For a discussion of our monetary policy during the 2008- 14 period, s ee, for instance, Engen, Laubach, and 
Reifschneider (2015).   - 7 - 
The progress seen during 2014 indicated to the FOMC that it was no longer 
necessary to provide increasing amounts of support to the U.S. economy by continuing to 
add to the Federal Reserve’s holdings of longer -term securities.  Accordingly, the 
Committee continued to reduce the pace of asset purchases over the course of the year, ending its purchases in October .  That step, however, did not mark an immediate shift 
toward tighter monetary polic y because we also indicated then  that we did not expect to 
raise interest rates for a considerable time after the end of our securities purchases.  Moreover, as the Committee explained in a set of “normalization principles” issued that September, the inten tion was to maintain the overall size of the Federal Reserve’s balance 
sheet at an elevated level until sometime after the FOMC had begun to raise its target for the federal funds rate.
9  We decided that maintaining a highly accommodative stance of 
monetar y policy remained appropriate because, while the U.S. economy was stronger and 
closer to meeting our  statutory goals, we saw significant room for improvement.  In 
particular, the unemployment rate still stood above our assessment of its longer -run 
normal l evel--that is, the unemployment rate that we expect to prevail when the economy 
is operating at maximum employment-- and inflation remained below the 2 percent 
objective.  
Because my colleagues and I  expected that labor market conditions would 
continue to im prove and that inflation would move back to 2 percent over the medium 
                                                 
9 The FOMC’s Policy Normalization Principles and Plans are available on the Board’s website at  
https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20140917c.htm .   
    Several studies support the notion that maintaining the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet at an 
elevated level is consistent with keeping a highly accommodative policy stance, particularly when short -
term interest rates are close to zero, as it was the case in 2014 --see, for instance, D’Amico and  others  
(2012)  and many of the references in Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider (2015).  L arge Federal Reserve 
holdings of longer -term securities reduce the total amount of such securities available for purchase by the 
public, exert ing upward pressure on their prices  and, thus, depressing their yie lds and contributing to lower 
borrowing costs for American families and businesses .  - 8 - 
term, we anticipated that the time was approaching when the economy would be strong 
enough that we should start to scale back our support .  Indeed, the FOMC’s June 2014 
Summary  of Econom ic Projections (SEP) reported that nearly all FOMC participants saw 
a higher federal funds rate as appropriate in the next calendar year.  In contrast, only two participants in December 2013 thought that it would be appropriate to start raising that  
rate i n the next calendar year.  
Uneven Progress in 2015 and into 2016  
In 2015, t he unemployment rate fell  significantly faster than we generally had 
anticipated in 2014.  However, a series of unanticipated global developments beginning 
in the second half of 2014--including a prolonged decline in oil prices, a sizable appreciation of the dollar, and financial market turbulence emanating from abroad-- ended 
up having adverse implications for the outlook  for inflation and economic activity in the 
United States, prompting the FOMC to remove  monetary policy accommodati on at a 
slower pace than we  had anticipated in mid -2014. 
U.S. gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth generally surprised to the downside in 
2015, reflecting , in part, w eak economic activity abroad, the earlier appreciation of the 
dollar , and the effect of falling oil prices on business fixed investment.  This 
unanticipated slowing in the pace of the economic recovery caused us to worry about the sustainability of ongoing improvements in employment and, t hus, of likely progress 
toward our maximum employment goal.  Our worry was reinforced by our assessment 
that, with the federal funds rate still near zero, there would likely be only limited scope for us to respond by lowering short -term rates  if the weaken ing in economic activity 
turned out to be persistent.  In contrast, if the weakening proved transitory and the  - 9 - 
economy instead began to overheat, threatening to push inflation to an undesirably high 
level, the FOMC would have ample scope to respond through tighter monetary policy.  
Inflation also  was lower than expected , with headline PCE prices rising less than 
1 percent over the course of 2015, instead of a round 1- 3/4 percent as we had anticipated 
in June 2014.  Much of this shortfall reflected the effects  of falling oil prices and the 
appreciation of the dollar.  My colleagues and I typically look through the effects on inflation of fluctuations in oil prices and the dollar because these effects tend to be transitory.  However, we became concerned in 2015 about the risk that part of the decline in inflation could prove to be longer lasting, especially given that inflation had already been running below our 2 percent objective for quite some time.
10  These various 
considerations, along with our reassessment of longer -run economic conditions --which I 
will discuss shortly --explain why the Committee ended up raising the target range for the 
federal funds rate only 1/4 percentage point  in 2015, substantially less than the full 
percentage point increase suggested b y the median projection of FOMC participants 
reported in June 2014. 
2016 also brought some unexpected economic developments that led us to 
proceed cautiously.  During the first half of the year, mixed readings on the job market, along with additional disappointing data on real GDP growth, suggested again that progress toward the achievement of our maximum employment goal could be slowing markedly.  Meanwhile, i nflation  hovered just below 1 percent  as dollar appreciation 
continued to exert downward pressure on import prices , and financial market turbulence 
emanating from abroad --associated with concerns about the Chinese economy and the 
                                                 
10 These concerns were reinforced somewhat by a decline in market -based measures of inflation 
compensation .  - 10 - 
Brexit referendum --posed new risks to U.S. economic activity  and inflation.  Moreover, 
even as payroll gains turned solid again in the second half of 2016, the unemployment 
rate remained relatively flat, suggesting that perhaps  there was more room for 
improvement in the job market than we had previously thought.  Those unanticipated developments were part of the reason why the Committee again opted to proceed more slowly in removing accommodation than had been anticipated at the start of the year.  We ended up increasing the target range for the federal funds rate by only 1/4 percentage point over the course of 2016, rather than the full percentage point suggested by our  
December 2015  projections.   
Reassessing Longer -Run Conditions   
 The slower -than-anticipated increase in our federal funds rate target in 2015 and 
2016 reflected more than just the inflation, job market, and foreign developments I mentioned.  During that period, the FOMC and most private forecasters generally 
lowered their assessments of the longer -run neutral level  of the real federal funds rate.  
Indeed, at our October 2015 meeting, the FOMC had a comprehens ive discussion of 
neutral real interest rates and was impressed by the breadth of evidence suggesting that those rates had declined both here and abroad, and that the decline had been going  on for 
some time.  In response to this growing evidence, the media n assessment by  FOMC 
participants of the longer -run level of the real federal funds rate fell from 1 -3/4 percent in 
June 2014 to 1- 1/2 percent in December 2015 and then to 1 percent in December 2016.  
These reassessment s reflected, in part, the persistence of surprisingly sluggish 
productivity growth-- both in the United States and abroad-- and suggested that fewer  - 11 - 
federal funds rate increases would be necessary than previously thought to scale back 
accommodation.  
Partly in response to persistently slow wage  growth, FOMC participants and 
private forecasters have in recent years lowered  their estimates of the normal longer -run 
rate of unemployment.  The median projection of FO MC participants of the longer -run 
level of the unemployment rate fell from about 5 -1/4 percent in June 2014 to 
approximately 4 -3/4 percent in December 2016.  Other things being equal, a lower 
longer -run level of the unemployment rate suggests that the economy has greater scope to 
create jobs without generating too much inflation.11  Thus, t he downward revisions to 
FOMC participants’ views on the unemployment rate over the longer run contributed to 
our assessment that monetary policy could stay accommodative longer than we  had 
anticipated in 2014. 
Further Progress since Mid -2016 
The U.S. economy has exhibited remarkable resilience in the face of adverse 
shocks in recent years, and economic developments since mid -2016 have reinforced the 
Committee’s confidence that the economy is on track to achiev e our statutory goals.  J ob 
gains have remained quite solid, and the unemployment rate, at 4.8 percent in January, is 
now in line with the median of FOMC participants’ estimates of its longer -run normal 
level.  On the whole, the prospects for further moderate economic growth look 
encouragi ng, particularly as risks  emanating from abroad  appear to have receded 
                                                 
11 The assessment that there was perhaps more room for improvement in the labor market than previously 
thought was reinforced by data showing that the labor force participation rate remained relatively stable in 
2016, rather than declining as many had expected .  - 12 - 
somewhat.   The Committee currently assesses that the risks to the outlook are roughly 
balanced.  
Moreover , after remaining disappointingly low through mid- 2016, inflation 
moved up during the second half of 2016, mainly because of the diminishing effects of 
the earlier declines in energy prices and import prices.  More recently, higher energy prices appear to have temporarily boosted inflation, with t he total PCE  price index r ising  
nearly 2  percent in the 12  months ending in January .  Core PCE inflation --which 
excludes volatile energy and food prices  and, therefore, tends to be a better indicator of 
future inflation --has been running near 1 -3/4 percent .  Market -based measures of infl ation 
compensation have moved up, on net, in recent months, although they remain low.  
With the job market strengthening and inflation rising toward our target , the 
median assessment of FOMC participant s as of last December was that a cumulative 3/4 
percen tage point increase in the target range for the federal funds rate would likely be 
appropriate over the course of this year .  In light of current economic conditions, such an 
increase would be consistent with the Committee’s expectation that it will raise the target range for the federal funds rate at a gradual pace and would bring the real federal funds rate close to some estimates of its current neutral level .  However, partly because my 
colleagues and I expect the neutral real federal funds rate to rise somewhat  over the 
longer run, we projected additional gradual rate hikes in 2018 and 2019.   
Our individual projections for the appropriate path for the federal funds rate 
reflect economic forecasts  that generally envision that economic activity will expand at a 
moderate pace in coming years, labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further, and inflation will be at or near 2 percent over the medium term.  In short, we  - 13 - 
currently judge that it will be appropriate to g radually increase the federal funds rate if 
the economic data continue to come in about as we expect.  Indeed, at our meeting later 
this month , the Committee will evaluate whether employment and inflation are 
continuing to evolve in line with our  expectati ons, in which case a further adjustment of 
the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate.  
Nonetheless, as we have said many times --and as my discussion today 
demonstrates --monetary policy cannot be and is not on a preset course.  As in 2015 and 
2016, the Committee stands ready to adjust its  assessment of the appropriate path for 
monetary policy  if unanticipated developments materially change the  economic outlook. 
Monetary Policy Is Not a Panacea  
The U.S. economy has shown great improvement and is close to meeting our 
congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and price stab ility, but we of 
course recognize that important challenges remain.  For instance, as we noted in our latest 
Monetary Policy Report  to the Congress, the ongoing expansion ha s been the slowest 
since World War II , with real GDP growth averaging only about 2 percent per year.12  
This subdued pace reflects, in part, slower growth in the labor force in recent years --
compared with much of the post -World War II  period--and disappoint ing productivity 
growth both in the U nited S tates and abroad.  
Our report also noted that , despite a notable pickup in 2015, real incomes for the 
median family were still a bit lower than they were prior to the Great Recession, and the 
gains during this ec onomic recovery have been skewed toward the top of the income 
distribution, as has been the case for quite some time.  Families at the 10 th percentile of 
                                                 
12 See Board of Governors (2017).   - 14 - 
the income distribution earned about 4 percent less in 2015 than they did in 2007, 
whereas families at  the 90 th percentile earned about 4 percent more.  In addition, the 
economic circumstances of blacks and Hispanics, while improved since the depths of the recession, remain worse, on average, that those of whites or Asians.  
 These unwelcome developments unfortunately reflect structural challenges that 
lie substantially beyond the reach of monetary policy.  Monetary policy cannot, for instance, generate technological breakthroughs or affect demographic factors that would boost real G DP growth over the longer run or address the root causes of income 
inequality.  And monetary policy cannot improve the productivity of American workers.  Fiscal and regulatory policies --which are of course the responsibility of the 
Administration and the C ongress --are best suited to address such adverse structural 
trends. 
Conclusion  
To conclude , we at the Federal Reserve must remain squarely focused on our  
congressionally mandated goals.  T he economy has essentially met the employment 
portion of our mandate  and inflation is moving closer to our 2 percent objective .  This 
outcome suggest s that our goal -focused , outlook- dependent approach to scaling back 
accommodation over the past couple of years has served the U.S. economy well.   
This same approach will continue to drive our policy decisions in the months and 
years ahead.  With that in mind, our policy aims to support continued growth of the 
American economy in pursuit of our congressionally mandated objectives.  We do that, as I have noted, with an eye alwa ys on the risks.  To that end, we realize that w aiting too 
long to scale back some of our support could potentially require us to raise rates rapidly   - 15 - 
sometime  down the road, which in turn could risk disrupting financial markets and 
pushing the economy into recession.  Having said that, I currently see no evidence that 
the Federal Reserve has fallen behind the  curve, and I therefore continue to have 
confidence in our judgment that a gradual remov al of accommodation is likely to be 
appropriate .  However , as I  have noted, unless unanticipated developments adversely 
affect the economic outlook, the process of scaling back accommodation likely will not be as slow  as it was during  the p ast couple of years.

Let me begin by thanking the organizers for inviting me to participate in this 
important dialog ue on the role of finance in society.  The financial sector is vital to the 
economy.  A  well -functioning financial sector  promotes job creation, innovation, and 
inclusive economic growth .  But when the incentives facing financial firms are distorted, 
these firms may act in ways that can harm society.  Appropriate regulation, coupled with 
vigilant supervision, is  essential to address these issues.    
Unfortunately, in the years preceding the financial crisis, all too many firms took 
on risks they could neither meas ure nor manage.  Leverage, interconnectedness, and 
maturity and liquidity transformation escalated to dangerous levels across the financial 
system.  The result was the most severe financial crisis and economic downturn since the Great Depression.  Almost 9 million Americans lost their jobs , roughly twice as many 
lost their homes , and all too many households  ended up underwater on their mortgages 
and over burdened with debt .  To be sure, some individuals and families  borrowed 
unwisely , but too often financial  institutions encouraged the behavior that resulted in 
such excessive debt.   
In my remarks today I will discuss some important reasons why the incentives 
facing financial institutions  were distorted and the steps that regulators are taking to 
realign thos e incentives.    
The I mportant R ole of the F inancial S ector  
Before discussing the incentives  that contributed to the buildup of risk at financial 
institutions , I would like to highlight the important contributions that the financial sector 
makes to the eco nomy and society.  First and foremost, financial institutions channel 
society’s scarce savings to productive investments, thereby promoting business formation  - 2 - 
and job creation.  Access to capital is important for all firms, but it is particularly vital for  
startups and young firms, which often lack a sufficient stream of earnings to increase 
employment and internally finance capital spending.  Indeed, research shows that more highly developed financial systems disproportionately benefit entrepreneurship.

The financial sector also helps households save for retirement, purchase homes 
and cars, and weather unexpected developments.  Many financial innovations, such as the increased availability of low -cost mutual funds, have improved opportunities for 
househol ds to participate in asset markets and diversify their holdings.
2  Expanded credit 
access has helped households maintain living standards when suffering job loss, illness, or other unexpected contingencies.
3  Technological innovations have increased the ea se 
and convenience with which individuals make and receive payments.4  
The contribution of the financial sector to household risk management and 
business investment, as well as  the signif icant contribution of financial -sector 
development to economic growth, has been documented in many studies.5  Such research 
1 Recent reviews have highlighted potent ial costs of a distorted financial sector, but such reviews also 
emphasize the range of both theoretical and empirical work that has documented the many ways in which 
the financial sector c an support economic efficiency; see, for example, Greenwood and Scharfs tein (2013) 
and Zingales (2015) .  Guiso, Sapienza, and Zingales (2004) discuss evidence that financial development 
supports entrepreneurship, and Fort and others (2013) examine the importance of financing for business 
formation and young firms.  
2 Greenwood and Scharfstein (2013) discuss how an important fraction of growth in the U.S. financial 
sector reflects the greater demand of households for asset  management services and credit.  Malkiel (2013) 
considers similar issues and reviews how improved access to low -cost investment options has benefited 
households.  
3  Krueger and Perri (2006) analyze how an increase in access to credit contributed to households’ ability to 
smooth spending despite substantial income volatility.  
4 Changes in payment technolo gies have been rapid, and an area of particular interest is the fast growth of 
mobile payment and financial service technologies.  The Federal Reserve has conducted several surveys to 
understand these developments, and the most recent results are discussed  in Board of Governors (2015) .  
5 A substantial body of research finds that financial development supports economic growth, including 
Goldsmith (1969), King and Levine (1993), Rajan and Zingales  (1998), and Levine (2005).  It is 
noteworthy that this research emphasizes differences across countries, and that the United States is among 
the most financially developed countries in the world.                                                    - 3 - 
shows that, across countries and over time, financial development, up to a point, has 
disproportionately benefited the poor and served to alleviate economic inequality.6  
Distorted I ncentives in the F inancial S ector   
Despite these benefits, as we ha ve seen, actions by financial institutions have the 
potential to inflict harm on society.  Instead of promoting financial security through prudent mortgage underwriting, the financial sector prior to the crisis facilitated a bubble 
in the housing market an d too often encouraged households to take on mortgages they 
neither understood nor could afford.  Recent research has raised important questions 
about  the benefits  and costs  of the rapid growth of the financial services industry in the 
United S tates over t he past 40 years .

A combination of responses to distorted incentives by players throughout the 
financial system created an environment conducive to a crisis.  Excessive leverage placed 
institutions at great risk of insolvency in the event that severe, alb eit low -probability , 
problems materialized .  Over reliance on fragile short -term funding by many institutions 
left the system vulnerable to runs .  And excessive risk -taking increased the probability 
that severe problems would, in fact, materialize.  Moreove r, regulators --and the structure 
of the regulatory system itself --did not keep up with changes in the financial sector and 
were insufficiently attuned to systemic risks.   Once concerns began to develop about 
escalating losses at large firms, insufficient liquidity and capital interacted in an adverse 
6 Beck, Demirg üç-Kunt , and Levine (2007) show that financia l development reduces poverty and inequality 
in a study examining evidence across countries.  
7Zingales (2015) raises a number of questions regarding ways in which distortions in the financial sector 
may contribute to “rent seeking” activity that may promote inefficiency.  Philippon and Reshef (2012) 
examine trends in compensation in the financial sector and the contribution of such trends to the increase in 
income inequality in the United States in recent decades.  Philippon and Reshef (2013) and Cecchetti and Kharroubi (2012 ) revisit the links between financial development and economic growth, focusing 
particularly on these relationships around periods of rapid growth in the financial sector or among economies with a large financial sector.                                                    - 4 - 
feedback loop.  F unding pressures contributed to “ fire sales ” of financial assets and 
losses, reducing capital levels  and heightening liquidity pressures --culminating in the 
near collapse of the financial system in late 2008.  
Capital and l iquidity  
Several factors encouraged excessive leverage, including m arket perception s that 
some institutions were “too big to fail .”8  Financial institutions also had an incentive to 
engage in regulatory arbitrage, moving assets  to undercapitalized off -balance- sheet 
vehicles.  T he complexity of the largest banking organizations also may have impeded 
market discipline .  In addition, financial intermediation outside of the traditional banking 
sector grew rapidly in the years up to 2007, leaving gaps in the regulatory umbrella.  And 
conflicts in the incentives facing managers, shareholders, and creditors  may have induced 
banks to increase leverage .9   
To strengthen banks’ resilience , the Federal Reserve and the other banking 
agencies have substantially increased capital requirements .  Regulatory minimums for 
capital relative to risk -weighted assets are significantly higher , and c apital requirements  
now focus on the highest -quality ca pital, such as common equity .  In addition to risk-
based standards, bank holding companies and depositories face a leverage ratio requirement.  Also, significantly higher capital standards --both risk- weighted and 
leverage ratios --are being applied to the m ost systemically important banking 
organizations.  Such surcharges are appropriate because of the substantial harm that the 
8 For a review o f many factors that may have contributed to leverage in the financial sector and a  discussion 
of how, in some cases, these factors reflect distortions that  imply leverage was excessive, see Admati and 
others (2013a).  
9 The notion that “agency problems” --that is, conflicts in the interests o f managers and various stakeholders 
in firms --may contribute to excessive debt has a long history, most notably following the notion of “debt 
overhangs” from Myers (1977).  Hanson, Kashyap, and Stein (2011) emphasize the potential importance of 
this issue for the financial sector.  Admati and others (2013b) present a related mechanism.                                                    - 5 - 
failure of a systemic institution would inflict on the financial system and the economy.  
Higher capital standards provide  large, co mplex institutions with an incentive to reduce 
their systemic footprint.  We are also employing a nnual stress test s to gauge  large 
institutions’ ability to weather a very severe downturn and distress of counterparties and, importantly, continue lending to households and businesses.  Firms that do not meet these 
standards face restrictions on dividends and share buybacks.  As a result of these changes, for the largest banks, T ier 1 common equity --the highest -quality form of capital--has 
more than doubled since the financial crisis .   
New liquidity regulations will also improve incentives in the financial system.  
Prior to the crisis, institutions’ incentives to rely on short -term borrowing to fund 
investments in riskier or less  liquid instruments were di storted in two important ways.  
First, ma ny investors were willing to accept a very low interest rate on short -term 
liabilities of financial institutions or on securitizations without demanding adequate 
compensation for severe -but-unlikely  risks , such as a temp orary loss of market liquidity .  
Perhaps these firm s expected government support or  simply  considered illiquidity a very 
remote possibility.  S econd, institutions’ attempts to shift their holdings once concerns 
about credit or liquidity risk arose created a fire- sale dynamic that amplified declines in 
market values, causing unanticipated spillovers onto other institutions and across markets.
10   
Recently implemented regulations aim to strengthen liquidity.   For example, a 
new liquidity coverage ratio require s internationally active banking organizations to hold 
10 The notion that securities issued by financial institutions may provide liquidity services in a manner that 
potentially contributes to fr agility because such securities do not have the safety and liquidity of publicly 
issued securities is examined in, for example, Gorton, Lewellen, and Metrick (2012); Stein (2012); and 
Gorton and Ordoñez (2014).                                                    - 6 - 
sufficient high -quality liquid assets to meet their projected net cash outflows during a 30 -
day stress period.  A new process --the Comprehensive Liquidity Analysis and Review --
sets supervisory expectations for liquidity -risk management and evaluates institutions ’ 
practices against these benchmarks .  A propos al for a  net stable funding ratio would 
require better liquidity management at horizons beyond that covered by the liquidity  
coverage ratio .  A proposed capital surcharge for the largest firms would discourage 
overreliance on short -term wholesale funding.  Also, t he Securities and Exchange 
Commission has adopted changes in regulations that may help avoid future runs on prime 
money market mutua l funds  (that is, money funds that invest primarily in corporate debt 
securities) .  And reforms in the triparty repo market have reduced risks associated with 
intraday exposures.   
Large, complex  institutions and t oo big  to fail 
In the aftermath of the cri sis, the Congress tasked the banking regulators with 
challeng ing and chang ing the perception that any financial institution is too  big to fail by 
ensuring that  even very large banking organizations can be resolved without harming 
financial stability.  S teps are under  way to achieve this objective .  In particular, banking 
organizations are required to prepare “ living wills ”--plans for their rapid and orderly 
resolution in the event of insolvency.  Regulators are considering requiring that bank holding companies have sufficient total loss -absorbing capacity , including long -term 
debt, to enable them to be wound down without government support.
11  In addition, the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has designed a strategy that it could deploy 
11 For a discussion of total loss -absorbing c apacity, see Financial Stability Board (2014) , a consult ative 
document  on a proposal for a common international standard on t otal loss-absorbing capacity for global 
systemic banks .  The comment period on this FSB proposal ended in February of this year .                                                   - 7 - 
(known as S ingle  Point of Entry) to resolve a systemically important institution in an 
orderly manner.   
The crisis also revealed that r isk management at large, complex  financial 
institutions w as insufficient to handle the risks that some firms had taken.  Compensation 
systems all too frequently failed to appropriately account for longer -term risks 
undertaken by employees.  And lax controls in some cases contributed to unethical and 
illegal behavior by banking organizations and their employees.  T he Fed eral Reserve has 
made improving  risk management and internal controls a top priority .  For example, the 
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review , which  includes the stress tests that I 
mentioned, also involves an evaluation to ensure firms have a sound process in place for measuring and monitoring the risks they are taking and for matching their capital levels 
to those risks.  Also,  supervisors from the Fed and other agencies have pressed firms to 
improve their internal controls and to make their boards of directors more directly 
responsible for compensation decisions and employee conduct. 
Changes to Regulatory and Supervisory Focus  
As I noted, t he financial crisis revealed weaknesses in our nation’s system for 
supervising and regulating the financial industry.  Prior to the cr isis, regulatory agencies, 
including the Federal Reserve, focused on the safety and soundness of individual firms --
as required by their legislative  mandate at the time --rather than the stability of the 
financial system as a whole.  O ur regulatory system di d not provide any supervisory 
watchdog with responsibility for identifying and addressing risks associated with 
activities and institutions that were outside the regulatory perimeter.   The rapid growth of 
the “shadow” nonbank financial sector left signific ant gaps in regulat ion.  - 8 - 
In response, the Dodd- Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act  of 
2010 (Dodd- Frank Act)  expanded the mandate and authority of the Federal Reserve to 
allow it to consider  risks to financial stability in supervising financial firms under its 
charge.  Within the Federal Reserve System, we have reorganized our supervis ion of the 
most systemically important institutions to emphasize what we call a “horizontal 
perspective, ” which examines  institutions  as a group and in comparative terms , focusing 
on their interaction with the broader financial system.  We also created a new office within the Fed to identify emerging risks to stability in the broader financial system--both the ba nk and nonbank financial sectors --and to develop policies to mitigate systemic risk.  
The Dodd- Frank Act created the interagency Financial Stability Oversight Council, 
chaired by the Treasury Secretary, and the Federal Reserve is a member.  It is charged with identifying systemically  important financial institutions and systemically risky 
activities that are not subject to consolidated supervision and designating those 
institutions and activities for appropriate supervision.  A nd it is charged with  encourag ing 
greater information sharing and policy coordination across financial regulatory agencies . 
Where We S tand  
My topic is broad, and my time is short.  Let me end with three thoughts.  First, I 
believe that we and other supervisory agencies have made signif icant progress in 
addressing incentive problems within the financial sector, especially within the banking sector.  Second, policymakers, including those  of us  at the Federal Reserve, remain 
watchful for areas in need of further action or in which the steps taken to date need to be 
adjusted.  And, third, engagement with the broader public is crucial to ensuring that any future steps move our financial system  closer to where it should be.  Active debate and  - 9 - 
discussion of these issues  at this conference and i n other forums  is important to improve 
our understanding  of the challenges that remain .

 Good afternoon.  I am pleased to be he re at the National Press Club, and I’m 
especially glad for the opportunity to have  a conversation with journalists who write 
about economic policy from our nation’s capital.  Your job is not easy, but it is essential.  
Virtually every American is affected by de velopments in the economy and in economic 
policy.  But contemporary economic issu es can be highly complex, and few 
nonspecialists have the time or the background to master these issues on their own.  The 
public must therefore rely on the diligent re porting, clear thinking, and lucid writing of 
reporters determined to go beyond dueling bum per stickers and sound bites to help 
people understand what they need to make good decisions, both in their personal finances 
and at the polls.  These are we ighty responsibilities, and the journalists I know take them 
very seriously.  Today, I will provide a brief update on th e economy and how I expect it to evolve 
in the near term.  Then I will turn to the im plications for monetary policy.  Finally, I will 
briefly discuss the daunting fiscal ch allenges that we face as a nation.  
The Economic Outlook 
 The economic recovery that began in  the middle of 2009 appears to have 
strengthened in recent mont hs, although, to date, growth has not been fast enough to 
bring about a significant improvement in the job market.  The early phase of the 
recovery, in the second half of 2009 and in early 2010, was largely attributable to the 
stabilization of the financial system, the e ffects of expansionary monetary and fiscal 
policies, and a strong boost to production from businesses rebuilding their depleted 
inventories.  But economic growth slowed si gnificantly last spring as the impetus from  
 - 2 -
inventory building and fiscal stimulus diminished and as Europe’s debt problems roiled 
global financial markets.   
More recently, however, we have seen in creased evidence that a self-sustaining 
recovery in consumer and business spendi ng may be taking hold.  Notably, we learned 
last week that households increa sed their spending in the fourth  quarter, in real terms, at 
an annual rate of more than 4 percent.  Although a significant portion of this pickup 
reflected strong sales of moto r vehicles, the recent gains in consumer spending look to 
have been reasonably broad based.  Busine sses’ investments in new equipment and 
software grew robustly over most of last ye ar, as firms replaced aging equipment and as 
the demand for their products and services expa nded.  In contrast, in the housing sector, 
the overhang of vacant and foreclosed homes  continues to weigh heavily on both home 
prices and residential construction.  Over all, however, improving household and business 
confidence, accommodative monetary policy, and more-supportive financial conditions, 
including an apparent increase in the willingness of banks to make loans, seems likely to 
lead to a more rapid pace of economic recovery in 2011 than we saw last year. 
While indicators of spending and produc tion have, on balance, been encouraging, 
the job market has improved only slowly.  Following the loss of about 8-1/2 million jobs 
in 2008 and 2009, private-sector employment showed gains in 2010.  However, these 
gains were barely sufficient to accommodate  the inflow of recent graduates and other 
new entrants to the labor force and, therefore, not e nough to significantly reduce the 
overall unemployment rate.  Recent data do provide some grounds for optimism on the employment front; for example, initial claims for unemployment insurance have generally been trending down, and indicators of job openings and firms’ hiring plans  
 - 3 -
have improved.  Even so, with output growth likely to be moderate for awhile and with 
employers reportedly still reluctant to add to their payrolls, it will be several years before 
the unemployment rate has returned to a more normal level.  Until we see a sustained period of stronger job creation, we cannot consid er the recovery to be truly established. 
 On the inflation front, we have recently seen significant increases in some highly 
visible prices, notably for gasoline.  Ind eed, prices of many commodities have risen 
lately, largely as a result of the very strong demand fr om fast-growing emerging market 
economies, coupled, in some cases, with cons traints on supply.  Nevertheless, overall 
inflation remains quite low:  Over the 12 m onths ending in December, prices for all the 
goods and services purchased by households increased by only 1.2 percent, down from 
2.4 percent over the prior 12 months.
1  To assess underlying trends in inflation, 
economists also follow several alternative measur es of inflation; one such measure is so-
called core inflation, which excludes the mo re volatile food and energy components and 
therefore can be a better pred ictor of where overall inflation is headed.  Core inflation 
was only 0.7 percent in 2010, compared with  around 2-1/2 percent in 2007, the year 
before the recession began.  Wage growth has slowed as well, with average hourly 
earnings increasing only 1.8 per cent last year.  These downwar d trends in wage and price 
inflation are not surprising, given the substantial slack in the economy.  
Monetary Policy 
 In sum, although economic growth will probably increase this year, we expect the 
unemployment rate to remain stubbornly above , and inflation to remain persistently 
below, the levels that Federal Reserve policym akers have judged to be consistent over the 
longer term with our mandate from the C ongress to foster maximum employment and

price stability.  Under such conditions, the Federal Reserve would typically ease 
monetary policy by reduci ng the target for its short-term policy interest rate, the federal 
funds rate.  However, the target range fo r the funds rate has been near zero since 
December 2008, and the Federal Reserve has indicated that economic conditions are 
likely to warrant an exceptionally  low target rate for an exte nded period.  As a result, for 
the past two years we have been using alte rnative tools to provide additional monetary 
accommodation.   
In particular, over the past two years the Federal Reserve has further eased 
monetary conditions by purchasing longer-t erm securities on the open market.  From 
December 2008 through March 2010, we purchas ed about $1.7 trillion in longer-term 
Treasury, agency, and agency mortgage-back ed securities.  In  August 2010, we began 
reinvesting the proceeds from all securities th at matured or were redeemed in longer-term 
Treasury securities, so as to keep the size of our securities holdings roughly constant.  
Around the same time, we began to signal to fi nancial markets that we were considering 
providing additional monetary policy accommodation by conducting further asset purchases.  And in early November, we a nnounced a plan to purchase an additional 
$600 billion in longer-term Treasur y securities by the middle of this year.  All these 
purchases are settled thr ough the banking system, with the result that depository 
institutions now hold a very hi gh level of reserve ba lances with the Federal Reserve.   
Although large-scale purchases  of longer-term securities are a different monetary 
policy tool than the more familiar approach of targeting the federal funds rate, the two 
types of policies affect the economy in similar ways.  Conventional monetary policy easing works by lowering market expectations for the future pa th of short-term interest  
 - 5 -
rates, which, in turn, reduces the curren t level of longer-term interest rates and 
contributes to an easing in broader financial conditions.  These changes, by reducing 
borrowing costs and raising asset prices, bolster household and business spending and 
thus increase economic activity.  By comparison, the Federal Reserve’s purchases of longer-term securities ha ve not affected very short-term in terest rates, which remain close 
to zero, but instead put downward pressure di rectly on longer-term interest rates.  By 
easing conditions in credit a nd financial markets, these actions encourage spending by 
households and businesses through essentiall y the same channels as conventional 
monetary policy, thereby streng thening the economic recovery. 
A wide range of market indicators supports  the view that th e Federal Reserve’s 
securities purchases have been effective at  easing financial cond itions.  For example, 
since August, when we announced our polic y of reinvesting maturing securities and 
signaled we were considering more purchases , equity prices have risen significantly, 
volatility in the equity market has fall en, corporate bond spreads have narrowed, and 
inflation compensation as measured in the ma rket for inflation-indexed securities has 
risen from low to more normal levels.  Yi elds on 5- to 10-year Treasury securities 
initially declined markedly as markets priced  in prospective Fed purchases; these yields 
subsequently rose, however, as investors be came more optimistic about economic growth 
and as traders scaled back their expectations of future securities purchases.  All of these 
developments are what one would expect to  see when monetary policy becomes more 
accommodative, whether through conventional or less conventional means.  Interestingly, 
these developments are also remarkably simila r to those that occurred during the earlier 
episode of policy easing, notably in the months following our March 2009 announcement  
 - 6 -
of a significant expansion in securities pur chases.  The fact that financial markets 
responded in very similar ways to each of th ese policy actions lends credence to the view 
that these actions had the expected eff ects on markets and are thereby providing 
significant support to job creation and the economy. 
My colleagues and I have said that we  will review the asset purchase program 
regularly in light of incoming information and will adjust it as needed to promote 
maximum employment and stable prices.  In pa rticular, it bears emphasizing that we have 
the necessary tools to smoothly and effectivel y exit from the asset purchase program at 
the appropriate time.  In particular, our ability  to pay interest on reserve balances held at 
the Federal Reserve Banks will allow us to put upward pressure on short-term market 
interest rates and thus to tighten monetary  policy when required, ev en if bank reserves 
remain high.  Moreover, we have developed addi tional tools that will allow us to drain or 
immobilize bank reserves as re quired to facilitate the smooth withdrawal of policy 
accommodation when conditions warrant.  If needed, we could also tighten policy by 
redeeming or selling securities.  
Fiscal Policy 
 Fiscal policymakers also face significant challenges.  The federal budget deficit 
has expanded to an average of more than 9 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) over 
the past two years, up from an average of about 2 percent of GDP during the three years 
prior to the recession.  The extraordinarily wi de deficit largely re flects the weakness of 
the economy along with the actions that the Administration and the Congress took to ease 
the recession and steady financial markets.  However, even after economic and financial 
conditions have returned to normal, the fede ral budget will remain  on an unsustainable  
 - 7 -
path, with the budget gap becoming increasi ngly large over time, unless the Congress 
enacts significant changes in fiscal programs. 
For example, under plausible assumptions about how fiscal policies might evolve 
in the absence of major le gislative changes, the Congr essional Budget Office (CBO) 
projects the deficit to fall fr om around 9 percent of GDP curre ntly to roughl y 5 percent of 
GDP by 2015, but then to rise to about 6-1/ 2 percent of GDP by the end of the decade.2  
After that, it projects the budget outlook to deteriorate even  more rapidly, with federal 
debt held by the public reaching almost 90 percent of GDP by 2020 and 150 percent of 
GDP by 2030, up from about 60 percent at  the end of fiscal year 2010.   
The long-term fiscal challenges confron ting the nation are especially daunting 
because they are mostly the product of pow erful underlying trends, not short-term or 
temporary factors.  The two most important driving forces for th e federal budget are the 
aging of the U.S. population and rapidly ri sing health-care costs.  Indeed, the CBO 
projects that federal spen ding for health-care programs --which includes Medicare, 
Medicaid, and subsidies to purchase health insurance through new insurance exchanges--
will roughly double as a percentage of GDP over the next 25 years.3  The ability to 
control health-care costs, while still providing high-quality care to those who need it, will 
be critical for bringing the fede ral budget onto a sustainable path. 
The retirement of the baby-boom generation will also strain Social Security, as 
the number of workers paying taxes into the sy stem rises more slowly than the number of 
                                                 
2 The so-called alternative fiscal policy scenario, which assumes, among other things, that most of the tax 
cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003 are made permanent and that discretionary federal outlays rise at the same 
rate as GDP, is presented in Co ngressional Budget Office (2010), The Long-Term Budget Outlook  
(Washington:  CBO, June (revised August)), available at 
www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=11579&zzz=40884.

people receiving benefits.  Currently, there are about five individuals between the ages of 
20 and 64 for each person aged 65 and older.  By 2030, when most of the baby boomers will have retired, this ratio is projected to decline to around 3.
4  Overall, the projected 
fiscal pressures associated with Social Security are considerably smaller than the pressures associated with federal health  programs, but they are still notable.  
The CBO’s long-term budget projections, by design, do not account for the likely 
adverse economic effects of such high debt and deficits.  But if government debt and 
deficits were actually to grow at the pace envisioned, the economic and financial effects 
would be severe.  Sustained high rates of  government borrowing would both drain funds 
away from private investment and increase our  debt to foreigners, with adverse long-run 
effects on U.S. output, incomes, and standards of living.  Moreover, diminishing investor 
confidence that deficits will be brought unde r control would ultimately lead to sharply 
rising interest rates on government debt and, pot entially, to broader financial turmoil.  In 
a vicious circle, high and risi ng interest rates would cause debt-service payments on the 
federal debt to grow even fa ster, causing further increases in the debt-to-GDP ratio and 
making fiscal adjustment all the more difficult.   
How much adjustment is needed to restor e fiscal sustainability in the United 
States?  To help answer this question, it is  useful to apply the concept of the primary 
budget deficit, which is the government budget de ficit excluding interest payments on the 
national debt.  To stabilize th e ratio of federal debt to the GDP--a convenient benchmark 
for assessing fiscal sustainability--the prim ary budget deficit must be reduced to zero.

4 These figures are the inverse of the ratio of the population age 65 or older as a percentage of the 
population ages 20 to 64 shown in figure 3-2, p. 47, in CBO, The Long-Term Budget Outlook , in note 2. 
5 This result requires that the nominal rate of interest paid on government debt equal the rate of growth of 
nominal GDP, a condition which usually serves as a reas onable approximation.  If the rate of interest on

Under the CBO projection that I noted earlier, the primary budge t deficit is expected to 
be 2 percent of GDP in 2015 and then rise  to almost 3 percent of GDP in 2020 and 
6 percent of GDP in 2030.  These projections provide a gauge of the adjustments that will 
be necessary to attain fiscal sustainabilit y.  To put the budget on a sustainable trajectory, 
policy actions--either reductions in spendi ng or increases in revenues or some 
combination of the two--will have to be ta ken to eventually close these primary budget 
gaps. 
By definition, the unsustainable trajectories of deficits and debt that the CBO 
outlines cannot actually happen, because credito rs would never be willing to lend to a 
government with debt, relative  to national income, that is rising without limit.  The 
economist Herbert Stein succinctly described this  type of situation:  “If something cannot 
go on forever, it will stop.”6  One way or the other, fis cal adjustments sufficient to 
stabilize the federal budget mu st occur at some point.  The question is whether these 
adjustments will take place through a careful  and deliberative process that weighs 
priorities and gives people adequate time to  adjust to changes in government programs or 
tax policies, or whether the n eeded fiscal adjustments will be a rapid and painful response 
to a looming or actual fiscal crisis.  Acting now to develop a credible program to reduce 
future deficits would not only enhance economic  growth and stabilit y in the long run, but 
could also yield substantial ne ar-term benefits in terms of lower long-term interest rates 
and increased consumer and business confid ence.  Plans recently put forward by the 
President’s National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform and other 
                                                                                                                                                 
government debt is higher than the growth rate of nominal GDP, as might happen if creditors become wary 
of lending, then a primary budget surplus rather than pr imary balance is needed to stabilize the ratio of debt 
to GDP.

prominent groups provide useful starting point s for a much-needed national conversation.  
Although these proposals differ on many details, th ey demonstrate that realistic solutions 
to our fiscal problem s are available.   
Of course, economic growth is affected  not only by the levels of taxes and 
spending, but also by their composition and stru cture.  I hope that, in addressing our long-
term fiscal challenges, the Congress and th e Administration will seek reforms to the 
government’s tax policies and spending priorities  that serve not only to reduce the deficit, 
but also to enhance the long-term growth  potential of our economy--for example, by 
reducing disincentives to work and to save, by encouraging investment in the skills of our 
workforce as well as in new machinery a nd equipment, by promoting research and 
development, and by providing necessary public infrastructure.  Our nation cannot 
reasonably expect to grow its way out of our  fiscal imbalances, but a more productive 
economy will ease the trad eoffs that we face.

Janet L. Yellen  
 
Chair  
 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  
 
at the 
 
“National Summit on Diversity in the Economics Profession”   
 
A Conference Sponsored by the American Economic Association and the  
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  
 
Washington, D.C. 
  
 
 
 
October 30, 2014  
 
           
  
I am very pleased that the American Economic Association (AEA) and the 
Federal Reserve Board have organized this conference on an important issue for our 
profession.   
In trying to raise awareness of diversity in the economics  profession, I am aided  
by the fact that  economists are well  acquainted with the  concept of diversity  from their 
work .  When conducting a survey, economists  understand that the results will be more 
meaningful when the diversity of the sample approaches the  diversity of the population 
being studied.  In finance, we know that diversity is fundamentally important in 
spreading  risk.  History show s that economies develop and become more stable through 
diversification.  Often, in the things economists study and t he methods we use , diversity 
is a good thing.   
To cite another example, r esearch by economists and other social scientists 
supports  the view that considering a diversity of perspectives and ideas leads to better  
decisions in an organization.  I believe de cisions by the Federal Reserve Board and the 
Federal Open Market Committee are better because of the range of views and 
perspectives brought to the table  by my fellow policymake rs, and I have encouraged this 
approach to decisionmaking at all levels and throughout the Fed System.    
One way to promote diversity of ideas is to promote diversity among the people 
we rely on for those ideas, including more than  300 Ph.D . economists who serve at the 
Board and more than  400 serving at the Fed’s 12 Reserve Banks .  At the Board, our  
Office of Diversity and Inclusion coordinates this effort, but everyone involved in the recruiting, hiring, management , and promotion of economists is engaged in it as well.  - 2 - 
 
When I was Vice Chair, I knew that promoting diversity among  Fed economists was a 
priority for Chairman Bernanke , and  it continues to be a priority for me .   
In 1977, when I joined the Board staff, I was one of relatively few women 
economists  here.  Since then , there have  been significant gains in diversity at the Board 
and throughout the System .  The Fed eral Reserve is committed to achieving further 
progress, and to better understanding the challenges to improving  diversity throughout 
the economic s profession.  As an employer , the Fed  is very serious about meeting its  
obligation to provide equal opportunity, and I also believe that diversity makes the Fed 
more effective in carrying out its mission, for reasons such as the one I mentioned a 
moment ago.  
But this conference offers an important  opportunity to investiga te all of the 
possible factors that influence the extent of diversity among economists at the Federal Reserve and elsewhere, including those factors that are affecting the education and advancement of economists everywhere in the United States .   
As a long time member of the AEA, I am proud of the work our association  has 
done to collect data and study  diversity  in the economics profession.  Among the 
questions raised by the AEA’s work on this topic is why relatively few women and minorities seem to consider  economics as a concent ration in college.  The evidence is 
fairly  clear that majoring in economics offers relatively high returns to college gradua tes 
whether or not they pursue further education in economics.  It is worth knowing, for 
example, what underg rads who might consider concentrating in economics think about 
the curriculum and the employment prospects for economics majors compared with what those prospe cts actually are.  To what extent might the lack of diversity among - 3 - 
 
economics majors reflect a mo re general need to make basic economics more relevant 
and otherwise appealing to undergrads?  
The AEA has also done important work documenting and investigating the “leaky 
pipeline ,” trying to determine why some groups are more likely to abandon economics 
education and work before , and even  after, receiving Ph.D.s .  In reviewing the data on the 
representation and advancement of certain groups in the profession, there are differences 
in outcomes for women and minorities.  To what extent are these disparities caused by 
differences in  the experiences of those groups or due to broader and more general 
challenges faced in academia ?  Do the leaks from the pipeline that may be more 
noticeable for some groups reflect a broader lack of opportunity in academia?   When 
economists delve into why there isn’t more diversity among them , they end up asking 
about what is being taught in college, how economists are being trained in graduate 
school, and ot her questions that bear on the health and the future of the economics 
profession in general.   
These are not idle questions .  All  of you know that t here has been  a fair amount of  
public debate in recent years about the health of the economics profession, prompted in part by the failure of many economists to  comprehend the dire threats and foresee the 
damage of the financial crisis.   When the public asks whether economists did all they 
could have to understand those threats, in part they are asking whether our profession did enough over the years to test ideas and assumptions that turned out in some cases to have been mistaken  or misplaced .  And part of that question is this one:  Did the economics 
profession recruit and promote the individuals best able to bring the energy, the fresh - 4 - 
 
insights , and the renewal that every field  and every body of knowle dge needs to remain 
healthy?   
When this question is asked again someday , when economics is tested by future 
challenges, I hope that our profession will be able t o say that we have done all we could 
to attract the best people and the best ideas.  That, I believe, is the very worthy goal of 
this conference, and I look forward to seeing it advanced by today’s discussions and by 
the continuing commitment demonstrated by the AEA  to diversity .  
  Thank you to those who organized the conference and to the distinguished 
members of our profession who have come here today to take part in it .

The Federal Reserve’s Framework for Monitoring Financial Stability

It is a pleasure to be back at the Economic Club of New York.  I will begin by 
briefly reviewing the  outlook for the economy, and then turn to a discussion of financial 
stability.  My main subject today will be the profound transformation since the Global 
Financial Crisis in the Federal Reserve’s approach to monitoring and addressing financial 
stability.  Today marks the publication of the Board of Governors’ first Financial 
Stabilit y Report .  Earlier this month, we published our first Supervision and Regulation 
Report .  Together, these reports contain a wealth of information on our approach to 
financial stability and to financial regulation more broadly.  By clearly and transparently  
explaining our policies, we aim to strengthen the foundation of democratic legitimacy 
that enables the Fed to serve the needs of the American public.   
Outlook and Monetary Policy  
Congress assigned the Federal Reserve the job of promoting maximum 
employment and price stability.  I am pleased to say that our economy is now close to 
both of those objectives.  The unemployment rate is 3.7 percent, a 49- year low , and many 
other measures of labor market strength are at or near historic bests.  Inflation  is near our 
2 percent target.  The economy is growing at an annual rate of about 3 percent , well 
above most estimates of its longer -run trend.   
For seven years d uring the  crisis and  its painful aftermath , the F ederal O pen 
Market C ommittee (FOMC) kept our  policy interest rate unprecedentedly low --in fact, 
near zero --to support the economy as it struggled to recover.  The health of t he economy 
gradually but steadily improved, and a bout three years ago the FOMC judged that the 
interests of households and bus inesses, of savers and borrowers, were no longer best 
served by such extraordinarily low rates.  We therefore began to raise our policy rate  - 2 - 
gradually toward levels that are more normal in a healthy economy.   Interest rates are still 
low by historical stan dards , and they remain  just below the broad range of estimates of 
the level that would be neutral for the economy --that is, neither speeding up nor slowing 
down growth.  My FOMC colleagues and I, as well as many private -sector  economists, 
are forecasting continued solid growth, low unemployment, and inflation near 2 percent.   
There is a great deal to like about this outlook.  But we know that things often  
turn out to be quite different from even the most careful forecasts.  For this reason, sound 
policymaking is as much about managing risks as it is about responding to the baseline 
forecast.  Our gradual pace of raising interest rates has been an exercise in balancing 
risks.  We know that  moving too fast would risk shortening the expansion.  We also know 
that moving too slowly--keeping interest rates too low for too long --could risk other 
distortions in the form of higher inflation or destabilizing financial imbalances.  Our path 
of gradual increases has been designed to balance these two risks, both of whic h we must 
take seriously.   
We also know that the economic effects of our gradual rate increases are 
uncertain, and may take a year or more to be fully realized.  While FOMC participants’ 
projections are based on our best assessments of the outlook, there is no preset policy 
path.  We will be paying very close attention to what incoming economic and financial 
data are telling us.  As always, our decisions on monetary policy will be designed to keep 
the economy on track in light of the changing outlook for j obs and inflation.   
Under the dual mandate, jobs and inflation are the Fed’s meat and potatoes.  In 
the rest of my comments, I will focus on financial stability --a topic that has always been 
on the menu, but that, since the crisis, has become a more integral part of the meal.    - 3 - 
Historical Perspective on Financial Stability  
The term “financial stability” has a particular meaning in this context.  A stable 
financial system is one that continues to function effectively even in severely adverse 
conditions.  A stable system  meets the borrowing and investment needs of households 
and businesses  despite economic turbulence .  An unstable system, in contrast, may 
amplify turbulence and prolong economic hardship in the face of s tress by failing to 
provide these essential services when they are needed most.  
For Economic Club of New York trivia buffs, I will note that the second ever 
presentation to this club by a Federal Reserve official was about this very topic.  The date 
was March 18, 1929.  Weeks before, the Fed had issued a public statement of concern 
over stock market speculation, and had provided guidance frowning on bank funding of 
such speculation.  W illiam Harding , a former Fed C hair and then president of the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Boston, defended the Fed’s actions in his talk.  He argued  that, while the 
Fed should not act as the arbiter of correct asset prices, it did ha ve a primary 
responsibility  to protect the banking system’s capacity to meet the credit needs of  
households and businesses .  At the meeting, critics argued that public statements about 
inflated asset prices were “fraught with danger;” that the nation’s banks were so well 
managed that they should not “face public admonition”; and, more generally, that the  Fed 
was “out of its sphere.”1  Of course, Harding spoke just a few months before the 1929 
stock market crash, which signaled the onset of the Great Depression.2 
                                                 
1 See remarks of W.P.G. Harding at a dinner of the Economic Club of New York on March 18, 1929, as 
reported in “Clash on Policies of Reserve Board” by the New York Times  on March 19, 1929, p. 52; and in 
“Reserv e Policy Upheld and Hit” by the Wall Street Journal  on March 19, 1929, p. 21.  Also see “Wall 
Street News and Comment,” Special Dispatch to the [Daily Boston] Globe,  on March 24, 1929, p. A60.  
2 Many factors after the initial crash, including what are now seen as major policy errors, contributed to the 
Great Depression.  See Milton Friedman and Anna Jacobson Schwartz (1963), A Monetary History of the 
United States, 1867- 1960  (Princeton, N.J.:  Princeton University Press); and Ben S. Bernanke (1983),  - 4 - 
Fast forwarding, a host of Depression -era reforms helped avoid, for the next 
three -quarters of  a century, a systemic financial crisis and the associated severe economic 
dislocation --the longest such period in American history .  Those decades saw many 
advances in monetary policy and in bank regulatory policy, but the appropriate role for 
government in managing threats to the broader financial system remained unresolved.  
Periodic bouts of financial stress during this period--such as the Latin American debt 
crisis, the savings and loan crisis, and the Russian debt default --were met with 
improvised res ponses.  Policymakers conjured fixes from a mixture of private -sector 
rescues, emergency liquidity, occasional implicit or explicit bailouts, and monetary 
accommodation.  Outside of these crisis responses, however, systemic issues were not a 
central focus of policy.  
The Global Financial Crisis demonstrated, in the clearest way, the limits of this 
approach.  Highly inventive and courageous improvisation amid scenes of great drama 
helped avoid another Great Depression, but failed to prevent the most severe r ecession in 
75 years.  The crisis made clear that there can be no macroeconomic stability without 
financial stability, and that systemic stability risks often take root and blossom in good 
times.3  Thus, as the emergency phase of the crisis subsided, Congr ess, the Fed, and the 
other financial regulators began developing a fundamentally different approach to 
financial stability.  Instead of relying on improvised responses after crises strike , 
policymakers now constantly monitor vulnerabilities and require fi rms to plan in advance

for financial distress, in a framework that lays out solutions in advance during good 
times.   
The New Approach to Financial Stability  
This new approach can be divided into three parts.  First, build up the strength and 
resilience of  the financial system.  Second, develop and apply a broad framework for 
monitoring financial stability on an ongoing basis.  And third, explain the new approach 
as transparently as possible, so that the public and its representatives in Congress can 
provide oversight and hold us accountable for  this work .  Although I’ll focus mainly on 
the stability efforts of the Federal Reserve, a number of federal regulatory agencies have 
responsibilities in this area.  All of these agencies are represented on the Financial 
Stability Oversight Council, or FSOC, which is chaired by the Treasury Secretary and 
which provides a forum for interagency cooperation in responding to emerging risks.   
Building Resilience of the Financial System  
After 10 years of concentrated effort in the public and private sectors, the system 
is now much stronger, with greater capacity to function effectively in stressful times.  In 
the banking system, we have implemented a pos t-crisis regulatory framework based on 
robust capital and  liquidity requirements, a strong stress -testing regime , and mandatory 
living wills for the largest firms.  As a result, banks now have much more high quality 
capital than before (figure 1).  The most recent stress tests indicate that, even after a 
severe global recession, capital levels at the largest banks would remain above regulatory 
minimums, and above the levels those banks held in good times before the crisis.4  The 
                                                 
4 See the F ederal Reserve’s November 2018 Supervision and Regulation Report,  available on the Board’s 
website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/pub lications/2018 -november -supervision -and-regulation -report -
preface.htm .  - 6 - 
most systemically important  financial institutions  also now hold roughly 20 percent of 
their assets in the form of high quality liquid assets --that is, safe assets that could be 
readily sold at short notice (figure 2).  The share of these assets is about four times its 
pre-crisis level.  
Compared with other economies, lending and borrowing in the United States 
depend less on bank loans and more on funds  flowing through a wide array of capital 
market channels.   The crisis revealed that this capital market centric system, despite its 
many benefits, also provides more places where systemic risks can emerge.  In response, 
Congress and the regulatory agencies  have made many stability -enhancing changes 
outside of the banking system.  For example, many derivatives transactions are now 
required to be centrally cleared, which, through netting, has reduce d exposures and 
enabled better management of counterparty ris k.  Tr i-party repurchase agreement ( repo) 
reforms have substantially improved the resilience of that marketplace, in particular by 
limiting intraday loans .  Before the crisis, prime institutional money market funds were 
permitted to report a constant, $1 s hare price so long as the value of the underlying assets 
remained near $1.  This reporting convention, combined with the implicit support of the 
plans’ sponsors, led investors to treat those funds like bank deposits, even though they 
were not likewise insu red.  These funds are now required to report floating net -asset 
values, and after this reform investors chose to migrate to government -only funds , which 
are safer and less susceptible  to runs (figure 3).5  These and other measures have reduced 
the risk tha t key non- bank parts of the system would freeze up in the face of market 
stress.  
                                                 
5 Given that government money fund asset holdings are limited to safe assets, they are allowed to maintain 
a $1 share price.    - 7 - 
A New Framework for Monitoring Systemic Risks  
Innovation and risk -taking  contribute to the dynamism of our financial system and 
our economy.  As Hyman Minsky emphasized, along with the many benefits of 
dynamism comes the reality that the financial system will sometimes evolve toward 
excess and dangerous imbalances.6  This reality underscores the vital importance of the 
second part of post -crisis reform:  monitoring for emerging vulnerabilities.  
As laid out in our new Financial Stability Report , we have developed a 
framework to help us monitor risks to stability in our complex and rapidly evolving 
financial system.  The framework distinguishes between shocks , that is, trigger events 
that can be hard to predict or influence , and vulnerabilities , defined as features of the 
financial system that amplify shocks.  The repor t is organized around four broad 
vulnerabilities that have been prominent in financial crises through the centuries.  Each of 
these vulnerabilities is often found to some degree even in healthy market -based systems, 
and there is not, at present, any genera lly accepted standard for assessing at what level 
the vulnerabilities begin to pose serious stability risks.  In lieu of such a standard, we flag 
cases in which the vulnerabilities rise well beyond historical norms, and then form 
judgments about the stabil ity risks those cases present.  
The first vulnerability is e xcessive leverage in the financial sector.7  If a highly 
leveraged segment of the financial system is buffeted by adverse events , the affected 
entities may all need to deleverage at the same time by selling assets, leading to what is 
called a “fire sale. ”  Both the resulting decline in asset prices and the impaired ability of 
the segment to play its role in the economy can amplify the effects of a downturn.  We 
                                                 
6 See Minsky , “Financial Crises,” in note 3 . 
7 A more high ly leveraged sector is one that relies more heavily on borrowed money.   - 8 - 
saw this chain of events play out rep eatedly in various parts of the financial sector in the 
weeks following the failure of Lehman Brothers in 2008.   
In our surveillance, w e examine leverage across many types of financial  
institutions, including banks, insurance companies, hedge funds, and various funding 
vehicles.  Currently, we do not detect a broad -based buildup of abnormal or excessive 
leverage.  As with banks, capital levels at insurance companies and broker -dealers appear 
robust.  In addition, securitization levels are far below their p re-crisis levels, and those 
structures that do exist rely on more stable funding (see figure 4).  Our view into leverage 
and risk -taking outside the banking sector is admittedly incomplete, however, and we are 
always working to get a better view of emergin g leverage excesses.8 
The second vulnerability is funding risk, which arises when banks or nonbank 
financial entities rely on funding that can be rapidly withdrawn.  If depositors or market 
participants lose faith in the soundness of an institution or the system as a whole, unstable 
funding can simply vanish in what is called a “run.”   During the  crisis, we saw 
widespread runs, including at broker -dealers, some segments of the repo market, and 
money market mutual funds .  These runs did severe damage, contri buting to a 
generalized panic at the time.  Had the authorities not stepped in, the damage could have 
been even more severe.   
Today we view funding- risk vulnerabilities as low .  Banks hold low levels of 
liabilities that are able and likely to run, and the y hold high levels of liquid assets to fund 
any outflows that do occur.  Money market mutual fund reforms have greatly reduced the

largest banks have committed about $1 trillion in lines of credit to nonbanks .    - 9 - 
most likely to run in a future st ress event, and the volume of such funding is now 
significantly below pre -crisis peaks.   
Taken together, the evidence on these first two vulnerabilities strongly supports 
the view that financial institutions and markets are substantially more resilient th an they 
were before the crisis.  Indeed, the American financial system has successfully weathered 
some periods of significant stress over the past several years.9  
The third vulnerability is excessive debt loads at households and businesses .  
Credit booms have  often led to credit busts  and sometimes to painful economic 
downturns.  When the bust comes, those who have overborrowed tend to sharply reduce 
their spending.  Defaults typically rise faster than had been expected, which may put 
financial institution s into distress.  These effects may combine to bring a serious 
economic downturn. 
This boom -bust pattern was clear in m easures of household debt  around the crisis 
period, with mortgage debt rising far above its historical trend and then contracting 
sharply (see figure 5) .  After the contraction, household debt has  grown only moderately.  
The net increase in mortgage debt has been among borrowers with higher credit scores.  
While heavily indebted households always suffer in a downturn, all of this suggests t hat 
household debt would not present a systemic stability threat if the economy sours.  
Nonfinancial business borrowing presents a subtler story .  With corporate debt, 
the U nited States  has not faced a massive credit boom like that experienced with 
residen tial mortgages before the recent crisis.  Instead, after controlling for its trend, 
                                                 
9 Examples include episodes of intensified concerns over euro -area fiscal challenges, the discontinuous and 
large appreciation of the Swiss franc in January 2015, and the market volatility associated with global 
growth concerns in late 2015.    - 10 - 
business borrowing relative GDP has risen during expansions, no doubt reflecting 
business optimism, and then fallen when the cycle turned, as some of that optimism 
proved unfounded (see figure 6).  By this measure, the ratio of corporate debt to GDP is 
about where one might expect after nearly a decade of economic expansion: it is well 
above its trend, but not yet at the peaks hit in the late 1980s or late 1990s.  Further, t he 
upward trend in recent years appears broadly consistent with the growth in business 
assets relati ve to GDP.    
There are reasons for concern, however.  Information on individual firms reveals 
that, ove r the past year, firms with high leverage and interes t burdens have been 
increasing their debt loads the most  (see figure 7).  In addition, other measures of 
underwriting quality have deteriorated, and leverage multiples have moved up.  Some of 
these highly leveraged borrowers would surely face distress if t he economy turned down, 
leading investors to take higher -than-expected losses--developments that could 
exacerbate the downturn.  The question for financial stability is whether elevated 
business bankruptcies and outsized losses would risk undermining the a bility of the 
financial system to perform its critical functions on behalf of households and businesses.  
For now, my view is that such losses are unlikely to pose a threat to the safety and 
soundness of the institutions at the core of the system and, inst ead, are likely to fall  on 
investors in vehicles like collateralized loan o bligations  with stable funding that present 
little threat of damaging fire sales .10  Of course, we will continue to monitor 
developments in this sector carefully.

delivered at the Stern School of Business, New York University, New York, N.Y., February 18, 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20150218a.htm .  - 11 - 
The fourth and final vulnerability arises when asset values rise far above 
conventional , historically observed valuation benchmarks --a phenomenon popularly 
referred to as a “bubble .”  The contentious term “bubble” does not appear in our work, 
however .11  Instead, we focus is on the extent to which an asset’s price is high or low 
relative to conventional benchmarks based on expected payoffs and current economic 
conditions.  Historically, when asset prices soar far above standard benchmarks, sharp 
declines follow with some regu larity, and those declines may bring economic misery 
reaching far beyond investors directly involved in the speculative boom.  We therefore 
pay close attention when valuations get to the extreme ends of what we  have  seen in 
history.   
Looking across the la ndscape  of major asset classes, we see some classes for 
which valuations seem high relative to history.  For example, even after standard 
adjustments for economic conditions, valuations on riskier forms of corporate debt and 
commercial properties are in th e upper ends of their post -crisis distributions, although 
they are short of the levels they hit in the pre -crisis credit boom.  We see no major asset 
class, however, where  valuations  appear far in excess of standard benchmarks as some 
did, for example, in the late 1990s dot -com boom  or the pre -crisis credit boom.  
The asset class that gets the most attention day -to-day is, of course, the stock 
market. Today, equity market prices are broadly consistent with historical benchmarks 
such as forward price- to-earni ngs ratios (see figure 8).  It is important to distinguish 
between market volatility and events that threaten financial stability.  Large, sustained 
                                                 
11 Analysts differ over how to define the term “bubble, ” and debate continues about the degree to which 
economic fundamentals might explain even the most famous apparent bubble cases from history.  On the 
topic of tulip mania, for example , see Peter M. Garber (1989), “Tulipmania,” Journal of Political Economy,  
vol. 97 (June), pp. 535 -60.”  - 12 - 
declines in equity prices can put downward pressure on spending and confidence.  From 
the financial stabili ty perspective, however, today we do not see dangerous excesses in 
the stock market.   
Monitoring Likely Triggers for Financial Distress  
I mentioned the distinction between vulnerabili ties and shocks, or triggers.  In 
addition to monitoring vulnerabilities  under our four -part framework , we also consult a 
broad range of contacts regarding sources of risk that might trigger distress at any given 
time.  For example, discussions with contacts currently point to risks emanating from the 
normalization of monetary  policy in the United States and elsewhere, the unsettled state 
of trade negotiations, Brexit negotiations, budget discussions between Italy and the 
European U nion, and cyber -related disruptions.12  
Having identified possible triggers, we can assess how a particular trigger is likely 
to interact with known vulnerabilities.  A good current example is that of Brexit.  U.S. 
banks and broker -dealers participate in some of the markets most likely to be aff ected by 
Brexit.  The Fed and other regulators have been working with U.S. financial institutions 
that have operations in the European Union or the United Kingdom to prepare for the full 
range of possible outcomes to the negotiations.  In addition, the sce narios used in the 
stress tests routinely feature severe global contractions and show that U.S. banks have the 
capital to weather even highly disruptive events.  
                                                 
12 The Financial Stability Report  does not currently have a standard set of metrics for determining the 
resiliency of critical financial systems to cyber disruptions.   Nonetheless, cyber risks are the subject of 
ongoing policy efforts at that Federal Reserve and other relevant agencies, and these entities are w orking to 
develop resiliency expectations and measures , which may be part of future discussions in the stability 
report.    - 13 - 
Bottom L ine: Financial Stability Risks Are Moderate  
I have reviewed  a few of the key facts tha t inform our thinking about financial 
stability, and you will find a great deal more detail in our new report.  You will also find 
that the report does not come to a bottom line conclusion.  As I noted earlier, we have 
limited experience with this monitori ng, and there is no widely accepted basis for 
reaching a bottom line.  Thus, the purpose of the report is to provide a common platform 
and set of readings from which policymakers and other interested parties can form their 
own views.  Individual policymake rs will sometimes differ in their  assessments and on 
the relative weight they put on particular vulnerabilities .  My own assessment is that , 
while risks are above normal in some areas and below normal in others,  overall financial 
stability vulnerabilities are at a moderate level .13   
In my view , the most important feature of the stability landscape is the strength of 
the financial system.  The risks of destabilizing runs are far lower than in the past.  The 
institutions at the heart of the financial system are more resilient.  The stress tests 
routinely feature extremely severe downturns in business credit, and the largest banks 
have the capital and liquidity to continue to function under such circumstances.  Because 
this core resilience is so important, we a re committed to preserv ing and strengthening the 
key improvements  since the crisis, particularly those in capital, liquidity, stress testing, 
and resolution. 
                                                 
13 The staff have also assessed financial stabilit y vulnerabilities as moderate.  For instance, see the minutes 
of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, July 31 -August 1, 2018, available on the Board’s website 
at https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20180822a.htm .  - 14 - 
Conclusion 
I’d like to conclude by putting financial stability and our two new reports in a 
longer -term context.  To paraphrase a famous line , “eternal vigilance is the price of 
financial stability.”  We will publish these reports regularly as part of our vigilance.   
Over time, some may be tempted to dismiss the reports entirely or to 
overdramatize any concerns they raise.  Instead, these reports should be viewed as you 
might view the results of a regular health checkup.  We all hope for a report that is not 
very excit ing.  Many baby boomers like me are, however, reaching an age where a good 
report is, “Well, there are a number of things we should keep an eye on, but all things 
considered you are in good health.”  That is how I view the F inancial Stability R eport  out 
today.   
We hope that this report and the Supervision and Regulation Report  will be 
important tools, sharing Federal Reserve views and stimulating public dialogue regarding 
the stability of the financial system.

April 9 , 2020  
  
Good morning.  The challenge we face today is different in scope and character 
from those we have faced before.  The coronavirus has spread quickly around the world, 
leaving a tragic and gro wing toll of illness and lost lives.  T his is first and foremost a  
public health crisis, and the most important response is coming from those on the front 
lines in  hospitals, emergency services, and care facilities.  We watch in collective awe 
and gratitude as these dedicated individuals put themselves at risk  in service to others and 
to our nation.   
Like other countries, we are taking forceful measures to co ntrol the spread of the 
virus.  Businesses have shuttered , workers are staying home , and we have suspended 
many basic social interactions.   People have been asked to put their lives and livelihoods 
on hold, at significant economic and personal cost.  We are moving with alarming speed 
from 50 -year lows in unemployment to what will likely be very high, although 
temporary, level s.   
All of us are affected, but the burdens are falling most heavily on those least able 
to carry them.  It is worth remembering that the measures we are taking to contain the virus represent an essential investment in our individual and collective health .  As a 
society, we should do everything we can to provide relief to those who are suffering for the public good.   
The recently passed C ares Act i s an important step in honoring that commitment, 
providing $2.2 trillion in relief to those who have lost their jobs , to low - and middle -
income households , to employers  of all sizes, to hospitals and health -care providers , and 
to state and local governments.  And there are reports of additional legislation in the 
works.  The  critical task of delivering  financial support directly to those most affected  - 2 - 
falls to elected officials, who use their powers of taxation and spending to make decisions 
about where we, as a society, should direct our collective resources .   
The Fed can also contribute in important ways:   by providing a measure of relief 
and s tability  during this period of constrained economic activity, and by using our tools 
to en sure that the eventual  recovery is as  vigorous as possible.   
To those ends, w e have lowered interest rates  to near zero in order to bring down 
borrowing costs.  We have also committed to keeping rates at this low level until we are 
confident that the economy has weathered the storm and is on track to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.   
Even more importantly, we have acted to safeguard financial markets in order to 
provide stability to the financial system and support the flow of credit in the economy.  As a result of the economic dislocations caused by the virus, some essential financial markets had begun to sink into dys function, and many channels that households , 
businesses, and state and local governments  rely on for credit had simply stopped 
working.  We acted forcefully to get our markets working again, and, as a resu lt, market 
conditions have generally improved.   
Many of the programs we are undertaking to support the flow of credit rely on 
emergency lending powers that are available only in very unusual circumstances—such as those we find ourselves in today —and only with the consent of the Secretary of the 
Treasury .  We are deploying these l ending powers to an unprecedented extent , enabled in 
large part by the financial backing from Congress and the Treasury.  We will continue to use these powers forcefully, pr oactive ly, and aggressively  until we are confident that we 
are solidly on the road to recovery.    - 3 - 
I would stress that these are lending powers, not spending powers.  The Fed is not 
authorized to grant money to particular beneficiaries.  The Fed can only make secured 
loans to solvent entities with the expectation that the loans will be fully repaid.  In the 
situation we face today, many borrowers will benefit from these programs, as will the overall economy.  But there will also be entities of various kinds that  need direct fiscal 
support rather than a loan they would struggle to repay.   
Our emergency measures are reserved for  truly rare circumstances, such as  those 
we face today.  When the economy is well on its way back to recovery, and private markets and institutions are once again  able to perform their vital function s of channeling 
credit and supporting economic growth, we will put these emergency tools aw ay.   
None of us has the luxury of choosing our challenges; fate and history provide 
them for us.  Our job is to meet the tests we are presented.   At the Fed, we are doing all 
we can to help shepherd the economy through this difficult time.  W hen the sprea d of the 
virus is under control, businesses will reopen, and p eople will come back to work.  There 
is every reason to believe that the economic rebound, when it comes, can be robust.  We 
entered this turbulent period on a strong economic footing, and that should help support 
the re covery.  In the meantime, we are using our tools to help build a bridge from the 
solid economic foundation on which we entered this crisis to a position of regained 
economic strength on the other side .   
I want to close by thanking the millions on the front lin es:  those working in 
health  care,  sanitation, transportation, grocery stores, warehouses, deliveries, security —
including our own team at the Federal Reserve —and countless others.  Day after day, you  - 4 - 
have put yourselves in harm’s way for others:  to care for us, to ensure we have access to 
the things we need, and to help us through this difficult time.   ",2020-04-09,powell

ovember 25, 2019 O
ver the past year, my colleagues and I on the Federal Open Market Committee 
(FOMC) have been conducting a first-ever public review of how we make monetary 
policy.  As part of that review, we held Fed Listens events around the country where representatives from a wide range of groups have been telling us how the economy is working for them and the people they represent and how the Federal Reserve might better promote the goals Congress has set for us:  maximum employment and price stability.  We have heard two messages loud and clear.  First, as this expansion continues into its 11th year—the longest in U.S. history—econ omic conditions are generally good.  
Second, the benefits of the long expansion are only now reaching many communities, and there is plenty of room to build on the impressive gains achieved so far.   
These themes show through in many ways in official statistics.  For example, 
more than a decade of steady advances has pushed the jobless rate near a 50 -year low, 
where it has remained for well over a year.  But the wealth of middle -income families —
savings, home equity, and other assets—has only recently surpassed levels seen before the Great Recession, and the wealth of people with lower incomes, while growing, has yet to fully recover.
1  
Fortunately, the outlook for further progress is good:  F orecasters are generally 
predicting continued growth, a strong job market, and inflation near 2 percent.  Tonight I will begin by discussing the Fed’s policy actions over the past year to support the favorable outlook.  Then I will turn to two important opportunities for further gains from

this expansion:  maintaining a stable and reliable pace of 2 percent inflation and 
spreading the benef its of employment more widely.   
Monetary Policy and the Economy in 2019 
We started 2019 with a favorable outlook, and over the year the outlook has 
changed only modestly in the eyes of many forecasters (figure 1).  For example, in the 
Survey of Professional Forecasters, the forecast for inflation  is a bit lower , but the 
unemployment forecast is unchanged and the forecast for gross domestic product (GDP) is nearly unchanged.
2  The key to the ongoing favorable outlook is household spending, 
which represents about 70 percent of the economy and continues to be strong, supported by the healthy job market, rising incomes, and solid consumer confidence.  
While events of the year have not much changed the outlook, the process of 
getting from there to here has been far from dull.  I will describe how we grappled with incoming information and made important monetary policy changes through the year to 
help keep the favorable outlook on track.   
As the year began, growth appeared robust, but the economy faced some risks 
flowing mainly from weakening global economic growth and trade developments.  
Foreign growth, which slipped in the second half of last year, slid further as 2019 progressed.  While w eaker foreign growth does not necessarily translate into similar 
weakness here , it does hurt our exporters and presents a risk that the weakness may 
spread  more broadly.  At the same time, business contacts around the country have been 
telling us that trade -related uncertainties are weighing on their decisions.  These global 
developments have been holding back overall economic growth.  Manufacturing output,

similar change.  -3 - 
which had only recentl y surpasse d its level before the Great Recession,  has declined this 
year and is again below its pre-recession pe ak.  Busine ss investment  has also w eakened.   
In addition, inflation pressures proved unexpectedly muted this year.  After 
remaining  close to our  symmetric 2 p ercent obj ective for  much of last year, inflation is 
now running below 2 percent.  Some of the softness in overall inflati on is the result of a 
fall in oil prices and should not affect inflation going forward.  But core inflation—which 
omits volatile food and energy prices—i s also running somewhat below 2 percent.   
The main t hemes of our deliberations this year have been a continuing favorable 
outlook founded on strength in the household sector, with a few yellow flags including 
muted inflation and w eakness in manufacturing.  In additi on, global growth and trade 
have present ed ongoing risks and uncertainties.  We also f aced som e less prominent  
factors that always confront  policymakers.  S pecifically, w e never h ave a crystal c lear 
real-time picture of how the economy is performing.  In addition, the precise timing and 
size of the effects of our policy decisions cannot be known in r eal time.  
In August, the Bureau of Labor Statistics previewed a l ikely revision t o its count 
of payroll job creation for the 12 months ended March 2019.  The preview indicated that 
job gains over that period were about half a million lower than previously reported.  On a 
monthly basis, job gains were likely about 170,000 per month, rather than 210,000.  
While this news did not dramatically alter our outlook, it pointed to an economy with 
somewhat less m omentum than we had thought.3   
3 The Fed’s real -time assessment of job growth this year is discussed in Jerome H. Powell (2019), “ Data -
Dependent Monetary Policy in an Evolving Economy,” speech delivered at “Trucks and Terabytes:  
Integrating the ‘Old’ and ‘New’ Economies,” the 61st Annua l Meeting of the National Association for 
Business Economics, Denver, Colorado, October 8,  
https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20191008a.htm .  - 4 - 
Uncertainty about how our policies are affecting t he economy also entered our 
discussions.  As you know, we set our policy interest rate to achieve our goals of 
maximum employment and stable prices.  In  doing so, we  often refer to certain 
benchmarks.  One of these is the interest rate that would be neutral—neither restraining 
the e conomy nor pushing it upward.  We call that rate “r*” (pronounced “r  star”).  A 
policy rate above r * would tend to restrain economic activity, while a setting below r * 
would tend to speed up the economy.  A second benchmark is the natural rate of 
unemployment, which is the lowest rate of unemployment that would not create upward 
pressure on inflation.  We call that rate “ u*” (pronounced “u  star”).  You can think of  r* 
and u* as  two of the main  stars by which we navigate.  In an idea l world, policymakers 
could rel y on these stars  like mariners before the advent of GPS.  But , unlike celestial 
stars on a clear night, we cannot directly observe these stars, and their values change in 
ways that are difficult to track in real time.  Standa rd estimates of r * and u* made by 
policymakers and other analysts have been falling since 2012 ( figure 2).  S ince the end of 
last year, incoming data —especially muted inflation data —prompted analysts inside and 
outside the Fed to again  revise down their estimates of r* and u*.4  Taken at face value, a 
lower r* would suggest that monetary policy is providing somewhat less support for 
employment and inflation tha n previously believed, and the fall in u* would suggest that 
the labor market was less tight than believed.5  Both could help explain the weakness in 
                                                 
4 Averagi ng across the estimates in figure 2, the estimates of r* are down 0.3 percentage point and those of 
u* are down 0.2 percentage point.  
5 Taken literally, the revised estimates of the stars would, by standard rules of thumb, call for a somewhat 
lower federal  funds rate.  For example, using the Taylor (1993) rule and using Okun’s law to state the rule 
in terms of the unemployment gap with a coefficient of 1 instead of the output gap with a coefficient of 0.5 , 
the shift in r* and u* would call for a 50  basis po int reduction in the federal funds rate.  John B. Taylor 
(1993), “Discretion versus Policy Rules in Practice,” Carnegie -Rochester Conference Series on Public 
Policy,  vol. 39 (December) (New York :  Elsevier ), pp. 195– 214.

inflation.  As with the revised jobs data, these revised estimates of the stars were not a 
game changer for policy , but they provided another reason why a somewhat lower setting 
of our policy interest rat e might be appropriate.  
How did we add up all of these considerations ?  To help keep the U.S. economy 
strong in the face of global developments and to provide some insurance against ongoing 
risks, we progressively eased the stance of monetary policy over t he course of the year.  
First, we signaled that increases in our short -term interest rate were unlikely.  Then, from 
July to October, we reduced the target range for the federal  funds rate by 3/4 percentage 
point.  The full effects of these monetary policy actions will be felt over time, but we 
believe they are already helping to support consumer and business  sentiment and 
boosting spending in interest -sensitive sectors, such as housing  and  consumer durable  
goods . 
We see the current stance of monetary poli cy as likely to remain appropriate as 
long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with our 
outlook of moderate economic growth, a strong labor market , and inflation near our 
symmetric 2 percent objective.  Looking ahead, we wi ll be monitoring the effects of our 
policy actions, along with other information bearing on the outlook, as we assess the 
appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate.  Of course, if developments 
emerge that cause a material reassessment  of our outlook, we would respond accordingly.  
Policy is not on a preset course.  
I will wrap up with two areas where we have an opportunity to build on our gains.   - 6 - 
A Sustained Return of Inflation to 2 percent  
For many years as the economy recovered from t he Great Recession, inflation 
averaged around 1.5 percent —below our 2 percent objective ( figure 3).  We had long 
expected that inflation would gradually rise as the expansion continued, and, as I noted, 
both overall and core inflation ran at rates consiste nt with our goal for much of 2018.  But 
this year, inflation is again running below 2 percent.   
It is reasonable to ask why inflation running somewhat  below 2 percent is a big 
deal.  We have heard a lot about inflation at our Fed Listens events.  People are 
concerned about the rising cost of medical care, of housing, and of college, but nobody 
seems to be complaining about overall inflation running below 2 percent.   Even central 
bankers are not concerned about any particular minor fluctua tion in inflation.   
Around the world, however, we have seen that inflation running persistently 
below target  can lead to an unhealthy dynamic in which inflation expectations drift down, 
pulling actual inflation further down.  Lower inflation can, in turn, pull interest rates to 
ever-lower levels.  The experience of Japan , and now the euro area, suggests that this 
dynamic is very difficult to reverse, and once under  way, it can make it harder for a 
central bank to support its economy by further lowering int erest rates.  That  is why it is  
essential that we at the Fed use our tools to make sure that we do not permit an unhealthy 
downward drift in inflation expectations  and inflation.  W e are strongly committed to 
symmetrically and sustainably achieving our 2 percent inflation objective so that in 
making long- term plans, households and businesses can reasonably expect 2 percent 
inflation over time .  - 7 - 
Spreading the Benefits of Employment  
Many people at our Fed Listens events have told us that this long expansion is  
now benefiting low - and middle -income communities to a degree that has not been felt 
for many years.  We have heard about companies, communities, and schools working 
together to help employees build skills —and of employers working creatively to structure 
jobs so that employees can do their jobs while coping with the demands of family and life 
beyond the workplace.  We have heard that many people who in the past struggled to stay 
in the workforce are now working and adding new and better chapters to their l ives.  
These stories show clearly in the job market data.  Employment gains have been broad 
based across all racial and ethnic groups and all levels of educational attainment as well 
as among people with disabilities (figure 4).   
The strong labor market i s also encouraging more people in their prime working 
years—ages 25 to 54—to rejoin or remain in the labor force, meaning that they either 
have a job or are actively looking for one.  This is a welcome development.  For several 
decades up u ntil the mid -1990s, the share of prime -age people in the labor force rose, as 
an influx of women more than offset some decline in male participation.  In the mid-
1990s, however, prime -age participation began to fall, and the drop- off became steeper in 
the Great Recession and the early years of the recovery ( figure 5).  Between 2007 and 
2013, falling participation by both men and women contributed to a 2 percentage point 
overall decline.  Our falling participation rate stands out among advanced economies.  
While the United States was roughly in the middle of the pack among 32 economies as of 
1995, in 2018 we ranked near the bottom ( figure 6).  Fortunately, in the strong job market 
since 2014, prime -age participation has been staging a comeback.  So far, we have made  - 8 - 
up more than half  the loss in the Great Recession, which translates to almost 2 million 
more people in the labor force.  But  prime age participation could be still higher.  
Income growth of low - and middle -income households has shown a pattern 
similar to that of p articipation, with two decades of disappointing news turning to better 
news during the past few years.  According to Census data, inflation- adjusted incomes for 
the lowest 20 percent of households declined slightly over the two decades through 2014, 
and income for the middle 20 percent rose only modestly.  Since then, incomes for these 
groups have risen more rapidly, as wage growth has picked up—and picked up most for 
the lower -paying jobs ( figure 7).   
Recent years’ data paint a hopeful picture of more peo ple in their prime years in 
the workforce and wages rising for low - and middle -income workers.  But as the people 
at our Fed Listens events emphasized, th is is just a start:  There is still plenty of room for 
building on these gains.  The Fed can play a ro le in this effort by steadfastly pursuing our 
goals of maximum employment and price stability.  T he research literature suggests a 
variety of policies , beyond the scope of monetary policy, that could spur further progress 
by better preparing people to meet  the challenges of technological innovation and global 
competition and by supporting and rewarding labor force participation.6  These policies 
could bring immense benefits both to the lives of workers and families directly affected 
and to the strength of the economy overall.  Of course, the task of evaluating the costs 
and benefits of these policies falls to our elected represent atives.

Conclusion 
Monetary policy is now well positioned to support a strong labor market and 
return inflation decisively to our symmetric 2 percent objective.  If the outlook changes 
materially, policy will change as well.  At this point in the long ex pansion, I see the glass 
as much more than half full.  With the right policies, we can fill it further , building on the 
gains so far and spread ing the benefits more broadly to all Americans.   Building on the Gains

August 24, 2018  
 Thank you for the opportuni ty to speak her e today.  Fifteen years ago, during the 
period now referred to as the Great Moderation, the topic of this symposiu m was 
“Adapting to a Changing Economy.”  In opening the proceedings, then -Chairman Alan 
Greenspan famously declare d that “uncer tainty is not just an i mportant feature of the 
monetary poli cy landscape; it i s the defining characteristic of that landscape.”1  On the 
doorstep of the period now referred to as the Global Financial Crisis, surely few, if any, 
at that symp osium woul d have imagined how shockingly different the next 15 years 
would be from the 15 years that preceded it. 
Over the course of a long recovery, the U.S. economy has strengthened 
substantially .  The unemployment rate has declined steadily for almost nine year s and, at 
3.9 percen t, is now n ear a 20-year lo w.  Most people who want jobs can find 
them .  Inflation has moved up and i s now near the Federal Open Marke t Committee’s 
(FOMC) objective of 2 percent after running generally below that level for six 
years.  With solid household and business confidence, healthy levels of job creation, 
rising incomes, and fiscal stimulus arrivi ng, there is good reason to expec t that this strong 
performance wi ll con tinue.   
As the economy has strengthened, the FOMC has gra dually raised the federal 
funds rate from its crisis- era low near z ero toward m ore norm al levels.  We are also 
allowing our securities holdings--assets acquired to support the economy during the deep 
recession and the long recovery--to decline gradually as these securities are paid off.  I 
will explain today why the Committee’s consensus view is that this gradual process of 
normalization remains appropriate.  As always, there are risk factors abroad and at home 
1 See Greenspan (2003), p. 1.  -2 - 
that, in time, could demand a different policy response, but today I will step back  from 
these.  
In keeping with the spirit of this year’s symposium topic --the changing  structure s 
of the economy --I would also note briefly that the U.S. economy faces a number  of 
longer -term structural challenges that are mostly beyond the reach of monetary 
policy.   For example, real wages, particularly for medium - and low -income workers, have 
grown quite slowly in recent decades.  E conomic mobility in the United States has 
declined  and is now lower than in most other advanced economies.2  Addressing the 
federal bud get deficit, which has long been on an unsustainable path, becomes 
increasingly important as a larger share of the population retires.   Finally, it is difficult to 
say when or whether the economy will break out of its low -productivity mode of the past 
decade or more, as it must if incomes are to rise meaningfully over time.   
My FOMC colleagues and I believe that we can best support progress on these 
longer -term issues by pursuing the Federal Reserve’s mandate and supporting continued 
economic growth, a strong labor market, and  inflation  near 2 percent.   The topic of 
managing uncertainty in policymaking remains particularly salient.   I will focus today  on 
one of the many facets of uncertainty discussed at the 2003 symposium --uncertainty 
around the locatio n of important macroeconomic variables such as the natural rate of 
unemployment.   A good place to start is with two opposing questions that regularly  arise 
in discussions of monetary policy both inside and outside the Fed:    
2 See Chetty and others (2014) and Chetty and others (2017).  - 3 - 
1.  With the unemployment rate well below estimates of  its longer -term normal  
level , why isn’t the FOMC tightening monetary policy more sharply to head off 
overheating and inflation?  
2.  With no clear sign of an inflation problem, why is the FOMC  tightening policy 
at all, at the risk of  choking off job growth and continued expansion?  
These questions strike me as representing the two errors that the Committee  is 
always seeking to avoid as expansions continue --moving too fast and needlessly 
shortening the expansion, versus moving too slowl y and risking a destabilizing 
overheating.    As I will discuss, the job of avoiding these errors is made challenging today 
because the economy has been changing in ways that are difficult to detect and measure 
in real time.  I will first lay out a  standard  view of a handful of basic relations hips that are 
thought to reflect key aspects of the underlying structure of the economy .   I will then use 
that framework to explain the role that structural change plays in our current policy 
deliberations, focusing on  how that role has been shaped by two historical episodes.  
Conventional Views of Macroeconomic Structure  
In conventional models of the economy , major economic  quantities such as 
inflation, unemployment , and the growth rate of gross domestic product  (GDP) fluctuate 
around value s that are considered “normal ,” or “natural ,” or “desired .”  The FOMC  has 
chosen a 2  percent inflation objective as one of these desired values.  The other values  are 
not directly observed, nor can they be chosen by anyone.  Instead, these values result 
from  myriad interactions throughout the economy.  In the FOMC’s quarterly Summary of 
Economic Projections  (SEP),  participants state their individual views on the longer -run  - 4 - 
normal values for the growth rate of GDP , the unemployment rate, and the federal  funds 
rate.   
These fundamental structural features of the economy are also known by more 
familiar names  such as the “natural rate of unemployment” and  “potential output 
growth.”  The longer -run federal funds rate mi nus long -run inflation is the “neutral real 
interest rate.”  At the Fed and elsewhere, analysts talk about these values so often that 
they have acquired shorthand names.  For example, u* (pronounced “ u star”) is the 
natural  rate of unemployment, r* (“ r star”) is the neutral real rate of interest, and π* (“ pi 
star”) is the inflation objective.  According to the conventional thinking, policymakers 
should navigate by these stars.3  In that sense, they are very much akin to celestial stars.     
For example, the  famous Taylor rule calls for setting the federal funds rate based  
on where inflation and unemployment  stand in relation to the stars.4  If inflation is higher 
than π*, raise the real federal funds rate relative to r *.  The higher real interest rate will, 
through various channels, tend to moderate spending by businesses and households, 
which will reduce upward pressure on prices and wages as the economy cools off.  In 
contrast, i f the unemployment rate is above u *, lower the real  federal funds rate relative  
to r*, which will stimulate spending and raise employment.      
Navigating by the stars can sound straightforward.  Guiding policy by the stars in 
practice, however, has been quite challenging of late because our best assessments of the 
location of the sta rs have been changing significantly.   
                                                 
3 In this talk, I will sidestep the issue of navigating by short -run versus long -run versions of the stars.  The 
challenges that I will highlight are, in my view, made more difficult, and the case for a careful risk -
management approach made stronger, by the  need to consider both short -run and long -run versions of the 
stars.   
4 The original Taylor rule (Taylor, 1993) uses output relative to potential in place of unemployment relative 
to its natural rate.  Both forms are now known as Taylor rules.   - 5 - 
Shifting Stars during Normalization     
In December 2013, the FOMC began winding down the final crisis -era asset  
purchase program.  Asset purchases declined to zero over 2014, and in December 2015, 
the FOMC began the gradual normalization of interest rates that continues to this day.  As 
normalization has proceeded,  FOMC participants and many other private - and public -
sector analysts regularly adjusted their assessments of the stars (figure 1).  Many 
projections of the natural rate of unemployment fell roughly 1 full percentage point, as 
did assessments of the neutral  interest rate.  Estimates of the potential growth rate of GDP 
slipped about 1/2 percentage point.   
These changing assessments have big implications.  For example , the 1 
percentage point fall in the neutral interest rate implies that the federal funds rate was 
considerably closer to its longer -run normal and, hence, that policy was less 
accommodative than thought  at the beginning of normalization.  The 1 percentage point 
fall in the natural rate of unemployment implies at present that about 1.6 million mor e 
people would have jobs when unemployment is at its longer -run level.  These shifts in the 
stars generally reflect analysts’ attempts to square their estimates with arriving 
macroeconomic data.  For example, as the unemployment rate fell toward, and then 
below, estimates of its natural rate, many expected inflation to move up.  When inflation 
instead moved sideways, a reasonable inference was that the natural rate was lower than 
previously thought.  Further, over this period, GDP growth was slower than one  might 
have expected based on the rapid decline in unemployment and the well -known 
relationship between output and unemployment known as Okun’s law.  Put another way, 
labor productivity growth consistently disappointed, which raised the question of whether   - 6 - 
that shortfall was temporary --perhaps due to headwinds from the crisis --or was part of a 
new normal.  
These assessments of the values of the stars are imprecise and subject to further 
revision.  To return to the nautical metaphor, the FOMC has been navigating between  the 
shoals of overheating and premature tightening with only a hazy view of what seem to b e 
shifting navigational guides.  Our approach to this challenge has been shaped by two 
much discussed historical episodes --the Great Inflation of the 1960s and 1970s and the 
“new economy” period of the late 1990s.  
Shifting Stars  and the Great Inflation  
While the crisis and its aftermath have been extraordinary in many ways , the 
shifting of the stars is not one of them .  Figure 2 illustrates the Congressional Budget 
Office’ s (CBO)  current estimate of movements in the natural rate of unemployment and 
potenti al GDP growth from 1960 to 2000 .5  Viewed against  the ups and downs  observed  
over these four decades, the recent shifts in longer -run values are not all that dramatic.  
Of course, these CBO estimates benefit from many years of hindsight , whereas monetary 
policy must be based on assessments made in real time.   The Great Inflation period 
vividly illustrates the difficulties this difference raises .  
Around 1965 , the United States entered a period of high and volatile inflation  that 
ended with  inflation in double  digits in the early 1980s.  Multiple factors , including 
monetary policy errors, contributed to the Great Inflation.  M any researchers  have 
concluded that a key mistake was that monetary policymakers placed too much emphasis 
                                                 
5  I am us ing the CBO’s estimates to reflect a conventional view over that time span since the SEP longer -
run values have only been reported since 2009.   - 7 - 
on imprecise --and, as it turns out, overly optimistic --real-time estimates of the  natural  
rate of unemployment.6     
Figure 3 compares  the CBO’s  current view of the natural rate of unemployment  in 
that era with an  estimate by Athanasios Orphanides and John Williams of the rate as 
policymakers perceived it in real time .  From 1965 to the early 1980s, this real -time 
estimate of u* was well below where hindsight now places it.  The unemployment rate  
over this period was  generally well above the real -time natural rate , and contemporary  
documents reveal that policymakers were wary of  pushing the unemployment rate even 
further  above u* (figure 4, top panel).7  With the benefit of hindsight, we now think that, 
except for a few years in the mid -1970s, the labor market was tight and contribu ting to 
inflation’s rise (figure 4, lower panel).     
It is now clear that the FOMC had placed too much emphasis on its imprecise  
estimates of u* and too little emphasis on evidence of rising inflation expectations.  The 
Great Inflation  did, however, prompt  an “expectations revolution” in macroeconomic 
thinking , with one overwhelmingly important lesson for monetary policymakers:   
Anchoring longer -term inflation expectations is a vital precondition for reaching all other  
monetary policy  goals.8 
When longer -term inflation expectations  are anchored , unanticipated 
developments may push inflation up or down, but people expect that inflation will return 
fairly promptly to the desired value.  This is the key insight at the heart of the widespread 
                                                 
6 See, for example, Burns (1979), Orphanides and Williams (2013), and the sources therein.  Romer and 
Romer (2002 ) and Sargent (2002) debate additional factors that may have played a role.  There is no 
dispute, however, that policymakers did misperceive the natural unemployment rate, and Orphanides and 
Williams show that misperception of the natural rate of unemploym ent alone would have been sufficient on 
its own to generate outcomes like the Great Inflation.

8 Many central bankers have made this case; see, for example, Bernanke (2007) and Yellen (2015).   - 8 - 
adoption of inflation targeting by central banks in the wake of the Great Inflation .  
Anchored expectations give a central bank greater flexibility to stabilize both 
unemployment and inflation.  When a central bank a cts to stimulate the economy to bring 
down unemployment, inflation might push above the bank’s inflation target.   With 
expectations anchored, people  expect  the central bank to pursue policies that bring 
inflation back down, and longer -term inflation expect ations do not rise.  Thus,  policy can 
be a bit more accommodative than if policymakers had to offset a rise in longer -term 
expectations.   
Shifting Stars and the  “New Economy” of the Late 1990s  
The second half of the 1990s confronted policymakers with a sit uation that was in 
some ways the flipside of that in the Great Inflation.  In  mid-1996,  the unemployment 
rate was below the natural rate as perceived in real time, and many FOMC participants 
and others were forecasting growth above the economy’s potential.   Sentiment was 
building on the FOMC to raise the federal funds rate to head off the risk of rising 
inflation.9  But Chairman Greenspan had a hunch that the United States was experiencing 
the wonders of a “new economy”  in which improved productivity growth  would allow 
faster output growth and lower unemployment , without serious inflation risks.   
Greenspan argued that the FOMC should hold off on  rate increases .   
Over the next two years, thanks to his considerable fortitude, Greenspan  
prevailed, and the  FOMC  raised the federal funds rate only once from mid -1996 through 
                                                 
9 This account is drawn from se veral accounts of the period:  Blinder and Yellen (2001), Blinder and Reis 
(2005), Meyer (1996), Meyer (2004), and the Federal Reserve’s Bluebook documents from June 1996 
through December 1998 (Board of Governors, various years).   - 9 - 
late 1998 .10  Starting in 1996,  the economy boomed  and the unemployment  rate fell,  but, 
contrary to conventional wisdom at the time, inflation fell.11     
Once again, shifting stars help explain the performance of inflation, which many  
had seen as a puzzle.  Whereas during the Great Inflation period the real -time natural rate 
of unemployment had been well below our current -day assessment, in the new -economy 
period, this relation was reversed (figure 3).  The labor market looked to be ti ght and 
getting tighter in real time, but in retrospect, we estimate that there was slack in the labor 
market in 1996 and early 1997, and the labor market only tightened appreciably through 
1998 (figure 4).  Greenspan was also right that the potential grow th rate had shifted up.  
With hindsight, we recognize today that higher potential growth could accommodate the 
very strong growth that actually materialized, let alone the moderate growth 
policymakers were forecasting.12  
The FOMC thus avoided the Great -Inflation -era mistake of overemphasizing  
imprecise estimates of the stars.   Under Chairman Greenspan’s leadership, the Committee 
converged on a risk -management strategy  that can be distilled into a simple request:   
Let’s wait one more meeting ; if there are cl earer signs of inflation , we will commence 
tightening.13  Meeting after meeting, the Committee held off on rate increases while 
                                                 
10 In the second half of 19 98, a Russian debt default and other ongoing financial instability in Asia 
intervened, and the FOMC rapidly lowered the federal funds rate 3/4 percentage point.  
11 By current data, over the eight quarters starting in 1996:Q3, core PCE (personal consumption  
expenditures) inflation fell from 1.8 percent to 1.3 percent.  
12 During this period, FOMC participants submitted six-quarter forecasts each July as part of the Fed’s 
semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress.   Each July from 1996 through 1998, the FOMC 
forecast growth very close to or above  the real -time estimates of potential growth.  The forecast growth is 
well below current estimates of potential output growth.  For the forecasts, see Board of Governors (199 6, 
1997, 1998).   
13 For a more complete discussion of the greatly distilled account here, see the sources in note 9.   - 10 - 
believing that signs of rising inflation would soon appear.  And meeting after meeting, 
inflation gradually declined.  
In retrospe ct, it may seem odd that it took great fortitude to defend “let’s wait one 
more meeting,” given that  inflation was low and falling.  Conventional wisdom at the 
time, however, still urged policymakers to respond preemptively to inflation risk --even 
when tha t risk was gleaned mainly from hazy , real-time assessments  of the stars .  With 
the experience in the new -economy period, policymakers were beginning to appreciate 
that, with inflation expectations much better anchored than before, there was a smaller 
risk that an inflation uptick under Greenspan’s “wait and see” approach would become a 
significant problem.  
Risk Management in the Face of Shifting Stars 
Given what the economy has shown us over the past 15 years, the need for the 
sort of risk-management appr oach that originated in the new -economy era is clearer than 
ever before.   That approach continues to evolve based on experience and the growing 
literature on monetary policy and structural uncertainty.  
Experience has revealed two realities about the relati on between inflation and 
unemployment , and these bear directly on the two questions I started with .  First, the stars 
are sometimes far from where we perceive them to be.  In particular, we now know that 
the level of the unemployment rate relative to our r eal-time estimate of u* will sometimes 
be a misleading  indicator of the state of the economy or of future inflation.   Second, the 
reverse also seems to be true:  Inflation may no longer be the first or best indicator of a 
tight labor market and rising pres sures on resource utilization.  P art of the reason  inflation 
sends a weaker signal  is undoubtedly the achievement of anchor ed inflation expectations  - 11 - 
and the related flattening of the P hillips curve .14  Whatever the cause, in the run -up to the 
past two recessions, d estabilizing excesses appeared mainly in financial ma rkets rather 
than in inflation .  Thus, risk management suggests looking beyond inflation  for signs of 
excesses.    
These two realities pre sent challenges.   The literature on uncertainty  reviewed at 
the 2003 symposium --and much refined since  then--provides important advice  for how 
policy should respond, although not yet, in my view, an explicit recipe or rule that a 
prudent central bank shoul d follow.15  The lite rature on robust rules, such as  so-called 
difference rule s, for example, supports the idea of putting less emphasis on the level of 
unemployment relative to u *.16  The FOMC’s practice of looking at a broad range of 
indicators when assess ing the state of the labor market  has explicitly been part of the 
FOMC’s Statement o n Longer -Run Goals an d Monetary P olicy Strategy  since its 
inception in 2012 .17  We have greatly expanded the scope of our surveillance for signs of 
labor market tightness an d of destabilizing excesses more generally.  
The risks from misperceiving the stars also now play a prominent role in the 
FOMC’s deliberations.  A paper  by Federal Reserve Board  staff is a recent example of a 
range of research  that helps FOMC participants v isualize and manage these risks.18  The 
research reports simulations of the economic outcomes that might result under various 
                                                 
14 Kiley (2015) reviews the literature on this point.  
15 The literature was reviewed by Walsh at the 2003 symposium; see Walsh (2003).  Also f rom the same 
symposium, see, for example, Greenspan (2003), Feldstein (2003), Fischer (2003), and Yellen (2003).  For 
a more recent perspective, see Wilkins (2017).  
16 See Taylor and Williams (2011).  Note that the robust rules literature does not suggest i gnoring the 
general notion of labor market tightness or of resource utilization more generally.  Indeed, robust rules 
often reflect tightness through the change in the unemployment rate.  Instead, the issue is about how best to 
take account of labor market  tightness when the best estimates of u* are very imprecise.  See also Erceg 
and others (2018).        
17 See Board of Governors (2018).  
18 See Erceg and others (2018).   - 12 - 
policy rules and policymaker misperceptions about the economy.  One general finding  is 
that no single, simple approach to monetary policy is likely to be appropriate across a 
broad range of plausible scenarios.19   More concretely, simulations like these inform our 
risk management by assessing the likelihood that misperception would lead to adverse 
outcomes, such as inflation falling b elow zero or rising above 5 percent.   
Finally, the  literature on structural uncertainty suggests some broader insights .  
This literature started with the work of William Brainard and the well -known Brainard 
principle , which  recommends that when you are uncertain about the effects of your 
actions, you should move conservatively.20  In other words, when  unsure of the potency 
of a medicine, start with a somewhat smaller dose.  As Brainard made clear, this is not a 
universal trut h, and recent research highlights two particularly important cases in which  
doing too little comes with higher costs than doing too much.  The first case is when 
attempting to avoid severely adverse  events such as a financial crisis or an extended 
period w ith interest rates at the effective lower bound.21  In such situations , the famous 
words “We will do whatever it takes” will likely be more effective than “We will take 
cautious steps toward doing whatever it takes.”  The second case is when inflation 
expec tations threaten to become unanchored.  If expectations were to begin to drift, the 
reality or expectation of a weak initial response could exacerbate the problem.22  I am 
confident that the FOMC would resolutely “do whatever it takes” should inflation 
expe ctations drift materially up or down or should crisis again threaten.  In addition, a 
                                                 
19 The paper illustrates that some standard intuitions do not hold up in all circumstances .  When following a 
standard Taylor rule and facing a very flat Phillips curve, for example, it is not always good advice to lower 
the weight on the gap between unemployment and u* and to raise the weight on inflation in making policy.  
See Erceg and other s (2018).   
20 See Brainard (1967).  
21 See Reifschneider and Williams (2000).  
22 See S öderstr öm (2002).   - 13 - 
decade of regulatory reforms and private -sector advances have greatly increased the 
strength and resilience of the financial system, with the aim of reducing the likeliho od 
that the inevitable financial shocks  will become crises.    
The Current Situation  
Let me conclude by returning to the  matter of navigating between the two risks I 
identified --moving too fast and needlessly shortening the expansion, versus moving too 
slowly and risking a destabilizing overheating.  Readers of the minutes of FOMC 
meetings and other communications will know that our discussions focus keenly on the 
relative salience of these risks.   The diversity of views on the FOMC is one of the great 
virtues of our system.  Despite differing views on these questions and others, we have a 
long institutional tradition of finding common ground in coalescing around a policy 
stance.   
I see the current path of gradually raising interest rates  as the FOMC’s  approach  
to taking seriously both of these risks.  While t he unemployment rate is below the 
Committee’s estimate of the longer -run natural  rate, estimates of this rate  are quite 
uncertain.  The same is true of estimates of the neutral interest rate.  We there fore refer to 
many indicators when judging the degree of slack in the economy or the degree of 
accommodation in the current policy stance.  We are also aware that, over time, inflation 
has become much less responsive to changes in resource utilization.     
While inflation has recently moved up near 2 percent, we have seen no clear  sign 
of an acceleration above 2 percent, and there does not seem to be an elevated risk of 
overheating.  This is good news, and  we believe that  this good news results in part from 
the ongoing  normalization process, which has moved the stance of policy gradually  - 14 - 
closer to the FOMC’s rough assessment of neutral as the expansion has continued .  As 
the most recent FOMC statement indicates, if the strong growth in income and jobs 
continues, further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will 
likely be appropriate .  
The economy is strong .  Inflation is near our 2 percent objective , and most  people 
who want a job are finding one.  My colleagues and I are carefully monitoring incoming 
data, and we are setting policy to do what monetary policy can do to support continued 
growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near 2  percent.
